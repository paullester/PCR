Although in the same period, energy from renewable sources is projected to more than double to 14% of global supply, 78% of primary energy in 2040 will still come from oil, natural gas and coal. While conventional wisdom is that the world is running out of fossil fuels, technical advances such as deepwater production, directional drilling, hydrofracturing, and the refining of non-conventional crude oil sources has increased the resoure base significantly and there is well over 100 years of reserves of all three fuels. The effect has been most most profound in the United States, where net energy imports are projected to fall from 23% to 12% of consumption between 2010 and 2020, with oil imports falling from 54% to 40% of consumption in the same period. Excellent, highly technical careers are, and will continue to be available to in the fossil fuels industry, with opportunities to influence the direction of industries to reduce their impact on the environment and in particular on climThis course will cover engineering technology in the oil, natural gas and coal from production through end use in transportation, power generation and heat, focus on safety and the potential for reducing environmental impacts.
