Our topical focus will be some of the main questions in moral philosophy. We'll consider questions from each main branch of conteporary moral philosophy. We will start by talking about issues in applied ethics. Applied ethics is concerned with analyzing the moral status of very specific types of acts. Applied ethics is ocncerned with analyzing the moral status of very specific types of acts. Applied ethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are we morally required to give to charity?', 'Is it ever morally permissible to have an abortion?', and 'Is it ever morally permissible to kill a non-combatant in wartime?'. We will use underlying disagreements about applied ethics to segue into a unit on normative ethics. Normative ethics is concerned with the general features of acts that make them right, wrong, good, or bad. Normative ethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are only the consequences relevant for determining what's right and wrong?', Do people have moral rights?', 'What does it take for one's life to go best?', and 'What is virtue?'. We will use underlying disagreements about normative ethics to segue into our third and final unit, which is about metaethics. Metaethics is concerned with the nature of moral stuff, moral talk, and moral thought. Metaethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are moral facts the kind of facts investigated by the sciences?', 'Are there any moral facts?', 'Do we know any moral facts?'. and 'Are moral facts objective?'. At the very end of the course, we will come back to applied ethics in order to see how spending a semester thinking about moral philosophy changes the ways we approach applied questions",

    "course_description" : "The Birth of Philosophy: What is philosophy? How does it differ from science, religion, literature, and other modes of human discourse? This course traces the origins of philosophy as a discipline in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece and Rome. We will examine how \"natural philosophers\" such as Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus distinguished their inquiries from the teachings of poets such as Homer and Hesiod; how ancient atomism had its origins in a response to Parmenides' challenge to the very assumption that things change in the world; how Socrates reoriented the focus of philosophy away from the natural world and toward the fundamental ethical question, \"how shall I live?\"; how his pupil Plato and subsequently Aristotle developed elaborate philosophical systems that address the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness. Finally, we will examine the ways in which later thinkers such as Epicureans, Stoics, and the neoPlatonists transformed and extended the earlier tradition.",

The first issue is how some early modern philosophers conceived of the relationship between God and world. In this section, we will look at various answers to the question: can we make sense of all aspects of the natural world without any appeal whatsoever to a God who created it? In the process of looking at various answers to this question, we'll also note the transformation of Western intellectual thought in this period, most notably, the slow separation of theology, metaphysics, and natural sciences into distinct disciplines. In this section, we will study texts of Descartes, Cavendish, Hume and Du Chatelet. The second issue is how some early modern philosophers think about the nature of human autonomy. In this section, we will look at different theories of human autonomy, including the impact upon such theories of the roles people play as a result of being members of families and other social groups. In this section, we return to Descartes and Cavendish before turning to the work of Astell and Kant. Of the six figures we will study, three are women whose works have long been under appreciated in the history of philosophy.

    "course_description" : "In this course, we will study a number of figures and texts in the 17th through 18th centuries to examine two central philosophical issues of this period. The first issue is how some early modern philosophers conceived of the relationship between God and world. In this section, we will look at various answers to the question: can we make sense of all aspects of the natural world without any appeal whatsoever to a God who created it? In the process of looking at various answers to this question, we'll also note the transformation of Western intellectual thought in this period, most notably, the slow separation of theology, metaphysics, and natural sciences into distinct disciplines. In this section, we will study texts of Descartes, Cavendish, Hume and Du Chatelet. The second issue is how some early modern philosophers think about the nature of human autonomy. In this section, we will look at different theories of human autonomy, including the impact upon such theories of the roles people play as a result of being members of families and other social groups. In this section, we return to Descartes and Cavendish before turning to the work of Astell and Kant. Of the six figures we will study, three are women whose works have long been under appreciated in the history of philosophy. And so throughout the course of the semester we will also be concerned with the meta-themes of canon formation and canon change.",
