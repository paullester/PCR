The studio site is typically located on vacant or abandoned land in North Philadelphia along the Delaware River. Such sites are fairly large in size and present a complex set of issues, including fragmentation, lack of access, and contamination. Through the design of a park, students test and refine the relationship among project concept, modes of visualization, and project formation (organizational and material). As a precursor to site work, students experiment with methods and materials for making organization and form in two and three dimensions. In the early part of the semester, we explore techniques of imaging that generate multiples (scenarios), serial progressions (transformations of a sort), and iterations (transformations of another). Through various grafting techniques, we use the resultant drawings and models as analogous structures in order to imagine possible future organizations and uses for the site. These studies occur in conjunction with site interpretations ranging from photographs and sketches, to measured drawings and diagrams. The objective for the studio is to develop an informed and imaginative response to the site in order to create new relationships among the site, its immediate edges and the larger neighborhood or region.",

Grading - the shaping and sculpting of the landform - is both art and science, and thus Workshop II aims to provide an appreciation of landform as an evocative component in the design vocabulary as well as a critical tool in solving difficult design problems. The basic techniques and strategies of grading design (slopes, terraces, water management, grade change devices) will be introduced, practiced and reinforced, so that grading design becomes an integral part of the students' design approach. Lecture, field trips, modeling, in-class exercises, and group projects will be used. The Planting component provides students with a working overview of the principles and processes of planting design. Plants will be considered both as individual elements and as part of larger dynamic systems. The natural distribution of plants, concepts of plant community and successional patterns, and the relationship of planting an topography will be used as the initial framework for planting design. Planting design typologies will be examined as an outgrowth of these \"natural\" patterns. The role of plants as a key element in the structural design of the landscape will be explored through a combination of modeling, plan and section drawing, temporal studies, writing, field trips and case studies. Emphasis will be placed on process and evolution: the temporality of planting (daily, seasonal and annual changes), establishment and maintenance of plantings, and the process of planting design. During the first week of May, a five-day field ecology course focuses on techniques of urban revitalization, sustainable land use, reclamation, and restoration. The field trips offer insight into the diversity of approaches to using plants to promote positive environmental change.",

Among the topics of discussion, this course will also take into account how recent phenomena such as the late twentieth-century increase in world population, sprawl, and environmental pollution, and how these have changed the reality described by the very word \"nature\" and have contributed to expand the domain of landscape architecture. The discussion of topics will integrate contemporary ideas and their roots in earlier theoretical formulation. The past will be presented as a way to illuminate, receive, and critique the present. Course objectives are to become familiar with the social and cultural processes that inform the landscape architectural discourse and to be able to discuss in an informed manner the impact of the latter upon design trends; to be able to trace the roots of contemporary ideas in earlier theoretical formulations; and to be able to think critically and to enhance synthesis and augmentation skills.",

The studio operates in what have been referred to as \"global cities\" - contexts in which there are significant pressures on the physical form of a metropolis from substantial population and economic growth (both ongoing and projected). These pressures induce considerable demands for the development of new contexts. The studio is focused on managing and megotiating these pressures through landscape-driven strategies capable of guiding and organizing this urbanization. Students develop individual design strategies through a process of mapping, modeling, scenario building and fieldwork that lead to both conceptual and physical proposals for the development of new urban districts and metropolitan agendas.",

The studio's focus is how design intelligence can be applied to complex urban problems which are at once systemic and spatial. Reaching across scales and across disciplines the studio immerses students in the social, economic, political, ecological and aesthetic complexity of the contemporary city in a way that interweaves the speculative quality of the design process with the analytical and evidence-based empiricism of urban reseach. Interdisciplinary collaboration is the studio's modus operandi and its purpose is to develop techniques and strategies by which contemporary cities can become not only metabolically more efficient but also more edifying of the human spirit in the 21st century. Acceptance into the studio is based on interview and portfolio with priority placements given to students enrolled in the Urban Design Certificate Program.",

Aspects of horticulture, landscape design, education, conservation, history, preservation, and management are considered. Work often includes seminars followed by outdoor practical sessions, many of which include plant identification sessions with the Arboretum Curator. Students will be tested on plant identification at the end of the semester. Students will be assigned an independent plant or landscape related project that they will research, design, complete and present as part of their work. This course is an internship that meets at the Morris Arboretum in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia on Thursday afternoons during the Spring term. There are also some day-long field trips to other public gardens and natural areas throughout the semester. For more information contact Jan McFarlan at the Arboretum, 215-247-5777, ext 156.",
