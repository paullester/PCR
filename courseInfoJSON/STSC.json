Humans have made and used technologies, though, for thousands if not millions of years. In this course, we will use this history as a resource to understand how technolgoeis affect social relations, and coversely how the culture of a society shapes the technologies it produces. Do different technolgoeis produce or result from different economic systems like feudalism, capitalism and communism? Can specific technologies promote democratic or authoritarian politics? Do they suggest or enforce different patterns of race, class or gender relations? Among the technologies we'll consider will be large objects like cathedrals, bridges, and airplanes; small ones like guns, clocks and birth control pills; and networks like the electrical grid, the highway system and the internet.",

Today's healing practices in these regions grew out of the interaction between the medical traditions of the colonized and those of the European colonizers. We therefore explore the nature of the interactions. What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? What were the effects of colonial racial and gender hierarchies on medical practice? How did practitioners of \"non-Western\" medicine carve out places for themselves? How did they redefine ancient traditions? How did patients find their way among multiple therapeutic traditions? How does biomedicine take a different shape when it is practiced under conditions of poverty, or of inequalities in power? How do today's medical problems grow out of this history? This is a fascinating history of race and gender, of pathogens and conquerors, of science and the body. It tells about the historical and regional roots of today's problems in international medicine.",

    "course_description" : "Over the last two centuries, scientists have produced a broad range of knowledge about the physical world, from light to electromagnetism to atoms to nuclei, facilitating or explaining an ever increasing mastery over the natural world. Becuse of their success, these developments played an important role in forming our views of how to effectively generate knowledge of the natural world. This course will examine some of the major developments in the physical sciences during the 19th and 20th century, asking how that knowledge and the means by which it was produced related to institutions, technical practices and broader cultural knowledge and knowledge production to explore how past practices have, or have not, left their traces in later science. The course will meet twice a week for lecture and discussion. Readings will consist of Pursuing Power and Light: Technology and Physics from James Watt to Albert Einstein by Bruce J. Hunt When Physics Became King by Iwan Rhys Morus Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist by Russel McCormmach as well as articles from a course reader. Students will produce three short papers (about three pages) and a term paper (about ten pages)",

This course will examine the many elements that went into the transition, including the revolution in cosmology, the revolt against ancient natural philosophy, the rise of experimentalism, the new philosophies of inquiry, new social structures for natural inquiry and the conceptual foundations of classical physics.\"",
