    "course_description" : "Effective governance relies upon consistent and ethical board leadership, yet nonprofit organizations that exemplify truly model governance are few and far between. This course introduces students to the broad framework of fiduciary, strategic and generative governance but will focus most deeply on the human dimensions of board leadership. In particular, we will examine real examples and cases of moral and ethical dilemmas faced by nonprofit boards and executive leaders, and the nuanced practice required to achieve effective board governance. This will involve a careful look at several real cases, as well as guest lectures from 3-4 different nonprofit board and CEO leaders. The invited leaders will use their own experiences to guide students through some of the most challenging ethical and managerial situations that can be encountered, with the goal of providing a practical grounding for students who expect to contribute to nonprofit leadership in their careers - either as executive staff or as board members. The course will include the review of 4-5 cases, readings, 2-3 brief student presentations, a team project and one final individual project. This course complements another half-credit course that was offered in fall 2014 (NPLD 580), Nonprofit Governing Boards. While there is some continuity between the two semesters (both build upon the Chait, Ryan, Taylor frameworks set out in Governance as Leadership), each class may be taken independently as a half-credit course. The spring class offers a deeper, more interactive probe into the elements of governance that arise in real practice, animated by dynamic nonprofit leaders sharing their experiences. Each course is targeted toward students who are interested in pursuing non-profit board or executive leadership roles, and will be coordinated with the Wharton Nonprofit Board Leadership Program (NBLP).",

    "course_description" : "Social entrepreneurs are individuals with innovative visions seeking to accomplish important public purposes through the creative and aggressive mobilization of people and resources. Using management and strategy frameworks presented in class and applied to real world organizations, student innovators learn to design and develop social impact organizations of their own invention. Students turn their passion for changing the world into concrete plans for launching a venture. Over the course of the semester, we will cover a broad array of topics associated with social innovation and entrepreneurship, including defining the problem/opportunity, refining the mission/vision, developing market research and industry analysis, defining a financial and operating structure, assessing results and progress, and scaling an enterprise. Elements of a venture plan will be drafted through multiple short assignments and students present formally and informally several times throughout the semester receiving feedback from faculty, peers, and accomplished social entrepreneurs. Graduate students in any of Penn's graduate and professional schools who want to create social value through either nonprofit or for-profit ventures are invited to take the class and develop their ideas. Being able to develop a coherent venture plan is great training for anyone who wants to work in the government, nonprofit or business sectors. The course attempts to convey a picture of what a well-considered and well-executed plan looks like with the goal of developing in students an appreciation for clear thinking in the pursuit of social value creation.",

Through a series of individual assignments, class discussions, exercises, and simulations, students will explore and understand the potential for acts of leadership at every level (and in every organization) to create wealth and acheive positive social change. The course is taught by the Executive Director of the Wharton Graduate Leadership Program and is open to graduate students throughout the university as well as Penn undergraduate seniors. In order to create, invoke, and evoke acts of leadership, we must understand ourselves, our teams and organizations, and our environments. From this integrated understanding, a set of possibilities emerge that shape the actions necessary to create positive social change. How can we leverage the abundance of resources available to individuals, teams, organizations, and collective networks? This course will explore leadership in five modules: individual leadership, team leadership, organizational leadership, leadership across boundaries, and network leadership. This seminar style survey course will blend didactic, dialogic, and experiential methods to build an integrated framework for analysis that identifies and amplifies the opportunities or acts of leadership.",

Students will be able to choose any three out of four workshop offerings that match their interests and passions. NOTE: Students must select three of the four workshops in addition to the lecture section to receive credit for this course! No more than three workshops may be taken by an individual student in a given term. Workshop topics are determined at the start of each semester. The workshops generally will meet two times with one week off in between for additional readings or an assignment. The structure of the classes will vary but the goal will remain the same: to give students an intensive exposure to three topics they may not otherwise be able to fit into their course plan. The course is open to all graduate and professional students as well as undergraduate juniors and seniors. Workshop titles and descriptions can be viewed on the NPLD website - http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/degree-programs/ms-in-nonprofit-leadership/academics/c ourse-descriptions-2/. The workshops generally meet on a Friday or Saturday and each session will be for a full day The structure of the classes will vary but the goal will remain the same: to give students intensive exposure to three topics that they may not otherwise be able to fit into their course plan.

The fundraising profession has created a body of knowledge in the past twenty years that can guide effective fundraising programs so that charitable organizations can support their mission. The sessions will reveiw the theory and practical techniques that development professionals use every day in large and small organizations including annual giving, major gifts, planned giving, cultivation of donors, making your case for support, the Seven Faces of Philanthropy, special events, and prospect research. There will also be discussions of philanthropic trends and current giving patterns. For those who are interested in nonprofit administration, these will be critical tools to understand.",

By bridging theory and practice, the class explores what dynamics are at play to deliver vital services or programs in healthcare, education, the arts, community development, and other issues. The course will also focus on these important questions: (1) Whose responsibility is the public good? How is that responsibility shared by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors? and (2) Given that responsibility for the public good, which individuals and groups make the decisions about how to serve the public good? How are these decisions made, and who benefits from these decisions? Students will consider these questions in an interdisciplinary context that will bring a historical and philosophical perspective to the examination of the values and institutions that characterize the contemporary philanthropy and the nonprofit sector.",
