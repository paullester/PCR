Particular attention will be paid to important policy issues relating to taxation, social security, low-income assistance, health insurance, education (both K-12 and higher ed), the environment, and government deficits. The costs and benefits of alternative policies will be explored along with the distribution of responsibilities between the federal, state and local governments. While the course will focus primarily on U.S. policies, the topics covered (e.g. tax reform, deficits versus austerity, etc.) are currently at the center of the policy debate in many other industrialized countries as well.",

Examples of policies will include clusters and other local development initiatives, large scale regional policies, employment zones and other targeted policies. More traditional urban policies such as zoning and planning and constraints, transportation pricing, and parking policies among many others will also be considered. Practical examples will be extremely diverse and include the Silicon Valley and attempts to copy it, the Tennessee Valley Authority, housing restrictions in developing countries such as Brazil, congestion pricing in London, etc. Students will be expected to actively participate and make presentations. The course emphasizes the importance of the economic context, the understanding of the underlying rationale for policies, and how the private agents respond to public incentives. The main learning goals are the following: be able to use simple empirical tools of economic evaluations, be able to articulate a critical analysis of competing viewpoints and assessments, and be able to integrate various analytic steps into an overall assessment of economic policies that relies on sound principles and is well argued.",

It is primarily a U.S. focused course, but does include a limited amount of international material for comparative purposes. The class is divided into four sections: (1) supply and demand for housing, including the operations of homebuilders and rental landlords; (2) house prices, including cycles and price dynamics; (3) international comparisons; and (4) public policy analysis applied to a current housing markets-related issue. This course presumes knowledge of intermediate economics, as we will apply that knowledge throughout the semester. For Wharton students, this means you must have passed BEPP 250 (undergrads) or MGEC 611 and MGEC 612 (MBAs). Non-Wharton students should have taken the equivalent course in the College.",

We will analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; the management of complementarities between products; the role of network effects and platform competition; and how firms can take advantage of the regulatory environment they operate in when making such decisions. We will study, for example, why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against the widely supported HD-DVD format; how the FCC plans to incentivize television broadcasters to return spectrum holdings for auction to wireless broadband providers; and how contracts with content providers affect firms' strategic interactions in the e-reader market. To understand how firm strategy and public policy interact, the course will rely on a mix of simple but rigorous analytical models and case studies.",

    "course_description" : "The nonprofit sector plays a key role in the provision of many goods and services which are fundamental in our society and which may be difficult to provide using market mechanisms alone. Education, health care, charitable services, and the arts are some primary examples of these. Nonprofit organizations operate in service of specific social missions rather than profit maximization, but in order to serve those missions effectively while ensuring their own survival, they must also make many of the decisions typically associated with private firms. That is, they must compete for funding, human resources, and consumers of their services, they must manage and invest their resources efficiently, and they must innovate new products and services over time. Importantly, the latter requirements may at times come in conflict with the organizations' social values. As a result, nonprofit organizations as economic decision-makers confront a number of unique challenges to their success and growth. The goal of this course is to give students a broad overview of the economic, organizational, and strategic concerns facing the non-profit sector. Our objective is to characterize the unique economic environment, identify effective strategic governance, and management approaches, and explore how appropriate measurement techniques can can inform the policy treatment of nonprofits. This course is organized around a number of lectures, readings and outside speakers, a midterm exam and a required project.",

Microeconomic theory is a highly useful set of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. Our goal in this course is to help you understand this body of theory so you can analyze private and public management problems in an economic framework. This is a \"tools\" course, but we will discuss many business applications and offer a strong emphasis on prescription, as opposed to description. For example, we will focus on profit maximization as a management objective rather than simply a foregone conclusion. The term begins with a brief introduction of the theory of supply and demand underlyng the competitive market model, the benchmark for evaluating other market structures similar to those encountered by real-world firms including monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. We then move to build an understnading of the development and use of market power, and strategic interaction among firms. Last, we examine market failures including asymmetric information and externalities.",
