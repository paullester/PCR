Topics covered include measurement and categorizing variables, use and misuse of descriptive statistics, testing hypotheses, and applying commonly used statistical tests. An emphasis will be placed on the practical application of data to address public health issues, rather than theoretical and mathematical development. Students will learn how to choose and apply statistical tools to data sources, when and how statistical tools can be used to analyze data, and how to interpret others' quantitative studies. Students will gain experience using online datasets and the STATA statistical software package.",

Studentslearn to appreciate how these skills can be used as practical tools for identifying public health problems, program development, program implementationincluding taking a reflective practice approach, ensuring equity and fairness in program delivery (i.e. combating disparities), and generally prmoting publichealth through effective and efficient programmatic efforts.",

This course will examine the fundamental challenges of public health action.  Using a case-based method, the course will probe true public health emergencies, considering the information available to scientists; public access and reaction to that information; and the nature/scope/consequences of interventions levied to address the public health threat.  The course will tackle cases from several areas of infectious and social epidemiology, such as the following: outbreak investigation (using a cholera example), lay epidemiology (examining cancer clusters), surveillance and rapid response (based on flu policy), and the dificulty of intervening to address social determinants of health (probably looking at poverty/SES and race/racism).Students in the class will develop key skillws in critical epidemiological reasoning.  In all cases, teh emphasis will on evaluating the empirical base for public health decision-making, with attention given to public health goals and metrics used to evaluate success in public health interventions.",

Anthropology and public health will examine complementary and competing concepts fundamental to each discipline and ways that these concepts make it essential and difficult for the disciplines to work together. Antrhopology on public health takes a critical look at assumptions in public health praxis.  Anthropology in public health will focus on ways that anthropology theory and methods inform the practice of public health.  Using these three approaches, we will examine topics in public health such as mental health, health promotion/disease prevention communication, cancer disparities, reproductive health, violence and infectious disease.  Students will learn and apply anthropologic research methods to these problems.",

Individual sessions will be devoted to topics such as the NurseFamily Partnership program, health insurance, smoking, and early childhood mental health. Sessions will examine how selection of research methods may influence results; the dialectical relationship between research and policy; and the role of various stakeholders (the media, foundations, government, advocates) in both research and policy debates. Didactic topical resaerh presentations will be followed by interactive discussions examining how research finds translates (or, as the case may be, do not translate) into policy. Guest speakers will include research and policy experts from the public and private sectors. Prerequisites are Fundamentals of Health Policy (offered through the Master's of Science in Health Policy); PUBH 505 Public Health Administration and Policy; or permission of instructor.
