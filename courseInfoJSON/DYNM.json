    "course_description" : "\"Perspectives\" is both a fundamental and integrating course intended for MSOD students at any point in the program who wish to understand and deploy a multiplicty of dynamics operative in organizations and in the minds that create and inhabit them. It is particularly useful for those in their first year and for non-MSOD students. One key focus is on understanding the implicit mental and emotional frameworks or metaphors that \"inform\" organizing so that we can virtually see more robust and complex approaches to effectiveness and to leadership within them. Several faculty members highlight their specialties. One special theme examines new management models and thinking frameworks designed to prevail in a 21st century context. Lectures, discussion, and experiential learning are used to build an informed grounding in the history, philosophy, theory and practice of Organizational Dynamics. The course requirements are active class participation, potential application projects/weekly journal, a midterm paper and a final paper.

    "course_description" : "Note: This class is predicated on the assumption that prior to offering coaching assistance, a coach should have a deep understanding of his or her own behavior and its impact on a client. Utilizing validated tools and strategies available for coaches, the students practice sets of coaching skills on each other. This includes practice in interviewing and observational skills. In addition, students will have the opportunity to give and analyze 360 degree feedback data, as well as use a variety of other instruments that can be foundational for a useful coaching experience. Premise: Coaching others is very serious business. Intrepid individuals willing to take on this responsibility should be willing to answer the following questions: Who am I as a leader and helper? What are the assets I bring to the coaching relationship? What are my deficits, overused strengths, or underutilized skills and behaviors? What historical influences from my family of origin influence my capacity to build a positive relationship with my coaching client? Are there discrepancies in relation to my self-perceptions and those who know me well--family members, peers, colleagues, friends, boss, and direct reports? As a result, are these specific areas of personal development that I need to address as I move Similar to most traditional programs where the focus is on the management of change, the course is organized to: 1) A diagnostic phase in which the values, history, assumptions, and behaviors of the client will be assessed. In this case the client will be the student/coach. 2) The applied phase in which analysis, interpretation, and formal learning will be the central focus. The end result will be individuals with a deep and abiding understanding of their own psychodynamics and their personal impact. Finally, by modeling many of the tools and strategies useful in any effective coaching effort and practicing them on themselves and their student peers, it is hoped that the experiential nature of the course will allow maximum transference to the real work of coaching. This class will meet on the following Saturdays and Sundays: January 17 and 18; February 21 and 22; March 22.

    "course_description" : "The purpose of this course is to explore, enhance, and expand the participants' competence in organizational politics. Students will observe political dynamics as they occur in their own organizations and will interview senior managers in other organizations to learn how political realities vary from one organization to another. Theoretical ideas about a dimension of organizational politics of particular interest to each individual participant will be analyzed in a term paper. In addition, each participant will keep a personal diary of political dynamics in his or her own workplace. The course will also explore ways to master the political skills of networking, negotiating, influencing, leading, and following, as well as developing a political strategy.

    "course_description" : "Environmentalist Paul Hawken challenged a class of 2009 college graduates that they would have to \"figure out what it means to be a human being on earth at a time when every living system is declining, and the rate of decline is accelerating.\" That theme is at the heart of this course. While we have seen the notion of sustainability gaining some traction in recent years, our quality of life in the near future very likely hinges on the development and implementation of sustainable solutions to enormously complex environmental and social problems. This course is designed to foster the thinking that is needed to address those enormous problems. It involves focusing on a critical global problem with sustainability and social dimensions - in this case, the rapid shift of an increasing global population to cities--and addressing it it in detail as a project team over the course of a semester. PENNovation is a course about innovation, idea generation, collaboration, leadership, communication, research, decision-making, sustainability, sustainable solutions, creative thinking, leading change, and complex problem-solving. Class members take a deep dive into a major sustainability challenge while alsogaining experience in how to effectively lead global teams. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 1990, less than 40% of the global population lived in cities and that figure is expected to grow to 60% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Such growth brings tremendous sustainability and design challenges in both developed and developing countries in terms of resource consumption, food security, water security, energy security, air quality, transportation, infrastructure, waste processing, recycling, and public health.It also brings opportunity. In 2015, the class will focus on the challenges and opportunities created by increasing urbanization with a focus on advancing development of sustainable cities. The group will take a systems approach to the problem, aided by contributions from several thought leaders from business,NGOs, and non-profits in a unique class format. Our expectation is that the world will benefit from their work. Activities and Outcomes: The end goal of this course will be to produce a world-class product including highly meaningful recommendations to solve the problem. Deliverables can include: final group paper, a website, an awareness-raising event, a social media campaign, or presentiation.

    "course_description" : "The primary objective of this course is to enable participants to gain a thorough understanding of and appreciation for the discipline of Project Portfolio Management. Ill-defined and poorly utilized in many organizations, Portfolio Management has struggled to become inculcated within the fabric of these cultures without direct intervention and sponsorship from the highest levels of Senior Management. Beginning with a decidedly strategic focus, the course brings together the very essence of Portfolio Management--technically robust analytics--with the softer elements of communication and decision- making to enable portfolio value maximization. The course is structured in sucha way that it follows a unique Portfolio Management framework--CREOPMTM-- created by the authors Bayney & Chakravarti in their book titled Enterprise Project Portfolio Management: Building Competencies For R&D and IT Investment Success. In each of the first 6 classes, the framework is followed sequentiallyand is then applied holistically to a case study in the final 2 classes. The impact of risk and uncertainty to the quantification of project, program, and portfolio value is addressed through classic program and portfolio optimizationStudents will be expected to apply many of the principles taught in this courseto their own organizations and to deliver class presentations that address portfolio strategy, linkages between organizational plans, decomposing complex decisions, project prioritization, portfolio optimization, and Stage Gate Review (SGR) processes. In their final paper, students will be presented with a choice of analyzing their organizations portfolio health or a selected Kellogg School of Management case study in Portfolio Management using the CREOPMTM framework.

Students will investigate the relationships between Program Management, Project Management and Portfolio Management as separate but co-dependent disciplines, and examine the importance of each to the successful achievement of organizational goals. Focusing on Program Management, the course will examine the unique challenges that are faced when managing organizational activities that principally pursue strategic goals, and that must be responsive to outcomes of activities being pursued and changes in strategic direction. The course will provide a forum for discussing the various types of Programs that organizations pursue, and for understanding how Program Managment best practices can be applied to each type of Program. The course will explore the need to adapt Program Management principles in a context-specific way to ensure that Programs deliver their expected organizational value. Moreover, it will examine how-despite qualitative differences between Programs-common approaches can be used to assess Program Management maturity and performance, and to define the skills required of a successful Program Leader. At the conclusion of the course, students will be expected to understand current best practices in Program Management, and to determine how to initiate or improve upon Program Management practices in their own organizations.

    "course_description" : "The objective of Program Leadership Skills is to provide students with an understanding of current principles and best practices in the maturing field of Program Management. Students will investigate the relationships between Program Management, Project Management and Portfolio Management as separate but co-dependent disciplines, and examine the importance of each to the successful achievement of organizational goals. Focusing on Program Management, the course will examine the unique challenges that are faced when managing organizational activities that principally pursue strategic goals, and that must be responsive to outcomes of activities being pursued and changes in strategic direction. The course will provide a forum for discussing the various types of Programs that organizations pursue, and for understanding how Program Managment best practices can be applied to each type of Program. The course will explore the need to adapt Program Management principles in a context-specific way to ensure that Programs deliver their expected organizational value. Moreover, it will examine how-despite qualitative differences between Programs-common approaches can be used to assess Program Management maturity and performance, and to define the skills required of a successful Program Leader. At the conclusion of the course, students will be expected to understand current best practices in Program Management, and to determine how to initiate or improve upon Program Management practices in their own organizations.

    "course_description" : "This course is designed for you if you are preparing to take responsibility without authority for actions that will make you the leader you have been looking for. The aim of this course is to prepare participants to drive results in an uncertain organizational environment, under high pressure. The learning objectives of this course are: a) to involve you in designing your personal cycle of leadership and development to benefit your organization and yourself and b) to experience applying the idealized design process to designing your personal LftM approach. The course requires reading, a class project, and independent work on your personal LftM opportunity or challenge. Students who take this course should already be concerned about one or more important opportunities or upsetting challenges in their present or previous organizational surroundings. The ionstructor will coach the class in functioning as an idealized design team. The design process has two phases, a base case projection and an idealized design. Phase 1, the base case projection, formulates the current reality without change, and projects the likely undesired effects and outcomes of maintaining status quo. Phase 2, idealized design, creates a leadership approach that all stakeholders would wish for, if all their feasible, sustainable and adaptable wishes could come true today. By participating in a design process, the class itself models many group dynamics of an actual LftM situation. Scholarly COmmons describes the work done in this class with examples.

    "course_description" : "Although groups and teams are often lauded as the mechanisms that provide the competitive edge for organizations in today's challenging economic environment, there is often little attention paid to the deeper social and psychological currents influencing group and team dynamics. Organizational leaders and facilitators frequently lack an in-depth understanding of how work groups, multifunctional teams, and cross-national executive groups develop, operate, accomplish their goals-or not-and end. Team members often struggle to make meaning of the myriad spoken, as well as unexpressed, factors influencing the process and outcomes of the groups of which they are a part. This course, by emphasizing both theory and practice, provides students with a thorough grounding in the ways groups and teams develop and learn. The class will also examine approaches to building group and team competencies related to effective communication, conflict-resolution, and solving complex strategic problems as well as ways to manage the range of intentional and more hidden dynamics that both support and challenge high performance. The course is designed to include seven 3-hour classroom meetings across the semester and two Saturday sessions that will afford students the opportunity to explore various theoretical frameworks. In addition to drawing on the extensive literature and research in group dynamics and team building, the class will rely on experiential methods to help students develop keener understanding and insight into the ways in which their own leadership and followership dynamics, as well as the dynamics of the group-as-a-whole, influence their team's ability to accomplish its tasks.

    "course_description" : "At one time or another, each of us has said something like, \"I know what to do to make some really effective--and possibly even profitable--changes in this organization,but the politics make it almost impossible to get anything done.\" The sense is that, althaough there are changes that should be made to improve organizational performance, politics (internal, external, governmental) simply obstructs our ability to make a difference. Frustrations notwithstanding, depending on how it is employed, politics can be either an impediment or, more importantly, a source of opportunities for improving organizations. Politics is the art and science of coordinating individuals, departments, management, markets--the entire organizational environment-to effect a balance between the organization's objectives and the methods used to achieve them. As with the other factors that are employed to affect organizational performance-the methods used to improve manufacturing, marketing, sales, finance, and so on-politics is a means that organizations can use to initiate and maintain critical personal and institutional relationships One of the seminar readings--Latimer's \"Why Do They Call It Business If It's Mostly Politics?\" is used to provide illustrations of the ambiguous nature of much of what is regarded as organizational politics. What is critical to understand and appreciate from the outset, however, is that politics is not an external factor that is imposed on organizations. Politics is not only a means for achieving personal or institutional power; it is also a method for developing and maintaining personal and institutional relationships within and among individuals and organizations of all types. This seminar will discuss organizational politics and the ways that it is used to identify, characterize, and effect change--both within and among organizations. After reviewing several perspectives on organizations and the roles that political processes play in decision-making, a series of cases is presented that illustrate the contexts and conditions for effective political communication and coordination.

Who is going to own what we all have a part in creating? The history of American business is an evolving answer to the question of ownership. Of all the issues relevant to organizational dynamics, ownership is arguably the most important and least understood. Matters of ownership have also been and remain of intimate concern to ordinary Americans-the slave yearning to be free, the young couple with a dream of home ownership, the entrepreneru who wants to be his own boss, the consultant who wants to form a partnership with her best friends, and the indebted, mid-level manager reviewing last year's 401(k) statement.

We compare the United States to China and Europe and the ways in which our different systems both compete and support each other. Each participant will research a portion of the regional job market, analyzing the source of investments, patents, required skill level and experience of employees, and competitive outlook. The final presentation and paper will fit their regional analysis into the global picture. Where does it fit? What are its risks?
