    "course_description" : "Paris, Ville-Lumiere, has long been renowned for its urbanity, architecture, and city design. This class will trace the people, ideas, and projects that contributed to this reputation, through an exploration of the city's built environment as expressed in literature and urban planning projects of the 19th and 20th centuries. Literary readings, including texts by Hugo, Baudelaire, Zola, and Breton, will be studied in conjunction with historical writings and projects ranging from works by Napoleon III and Haussmann to Mitterrand and Sarkozy. The course includes a field trip to France's capital city during Penn's Spring Break. Co-taught by Professors Eugenie Birch (Department of City and Regional Planning) and Andrea Goulet (Department of Romance Languages). Student travel expenses will be subsidized by the Mellon Foundation-sponsored Humanities + Urbanism + Design Project. REGISTRATION CLOSED.",

Some problems and challenges, whether simple or complex, are amenable to technical solutions based solely on the expertise of planners, managers, architects and others. There are, however, other problems and challenges that require adaptive work, primarily because technical expertise alone is insufficient to address the problems or challenges being faced. In this course, we'll focus on perspectives and methods for working through those later sorts of problems and challenges. Meets methods breadth requirement.",

In part one, students build knowledge about how theories of growth, specialization, agglomeration and innovation inform (and fail to inform) economic development strategies. In part two, they develop a working understanding of economic development finance, completing exercises on tax increment finance, tax-credit financed development and \"double bottom line\" lending and equity investment. In part three, they review best practices in the formulation and negotiation of location incentives and subsidies, examine \"growth with equity\" policies, and explore the technical and political details of economic impact analysis.",

We will examine contemporary labor markets through two thematic lenses. One is the growing discussion of knowledge industries and \"knowledge workers\" and their importance to regional innovative capacity and competitive advantage in a global economy. The other is the persistent challenge of unemployment, underemployment and working poverty within metropolitan regions. In exploring these themes, readings for the class synthesize perspectives on work, labor markets and economic growth from economics, sociology, history and political science. Class lecture and discussion, supplemented by the occasional guest practitioner, will focus on translating academic research into knowledge that can be used in local economic and community development practice.",
