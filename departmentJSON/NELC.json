To what degree are Second Temple Jewish and early Christian ideas about the messiah an extension of ancient Israelite concepts? To what degree might they reflect a response or reaction to Hellenistic and Roman imperial ideologies? How (and when) did beliefs surrounding Jesus depart meaningfully from Jewish ideas about the messiah? How do Rabbinic Jewish traditions about the messiah and messianic age differ from their Christian counterparts, and is there evidence of any \"influence\"? These questions will be explored with a focus on primary source readings.",

There is a continuous emphasis on vocabulary development and students are expected to add about five hundred new words to their active vocabulary per semester. The rules of grammar for structural accuracy and social-cultural propriety are parts of the regular curriculum. Class activities include students' short presentations, role-plays, singing and conversations. There are weekly assignments and quizzes, a mid-term and a final examination. The final evaluation will rest on class participation, performance in quizzes and tests, and completed assignments. This is a two-semester course.",

In this class we will read the core myths of these cultures in translation and situate them in their literary, historical, religious and cultural contexts. The case of characters includes, among other, Enki, trickster and god of wisdom; Inana, goddess of sex and war; and Marduk, warrior son, slayer of the sea, king of the gods and founder of Babylon. Themes range from creation to flood, from combat to the dangers of humans acting in the worlds of the divine, to the heroic peregrinations of Gilgamesh as he wrestles with monsters, fate and the pain of mortality.",

In practice, the connection between archaeology and cultural heritage has proven to be complicated. This course will examine the contemporary practice of archaeology in the Middle East in relation to cultural heritage management in these countries. We will review the involvement of western and native archaeologists in the region and the intellectual traditions behind such involvement. We will also address questions on the role of Near Eastern archaeology in the production of cultural heritage: how was/is archaeological data used in political conflicts? How does CHM in certain countries shape archaeological practice? Can archaeological work produce cultural heritage that is meaningful/useful to the local communities around archaeological sites? What is global heritage?",

The Destruction of Sennacherib). In the ninth, eighth and seventh centuries BCE, Assyrian armies marched out from their homeland in northern Iraq to Iran in the East, Egypt in the West, the Persian Gulf in the south and central Turkey in the north, and they created the largest empire known up until that time. They built impressive palaces and cities, created great works of art and have left us a vast number of documents preserving ancient literature and scholarly knowledge. In the course we will look at the structure of the Assyrian state, Assyrian culture, the development of the Assyrian empire, and its sudden collapse at the end of the seventh century. While the course will emphasize the use of textual sources, archaeological and iconographic data will also be used to help us arrive at an understanding of the great achievements of the ancient Assyrians.

Among the world's various legal systems, Islamic law may be the most widely misunderstood and even misrepresented; certainly, misconceptions about it abound. Islamic law is, however, the amazing product of a rich, fascinating and diverse cultural and intellectual tradition. Most of the readings in this course will be taken from primary sources in translation. Areas covered will include criminal law, family law, law in the Quran, gender and sexuality, the modern application of Islamic law, Islamic government and other selected topics.",

The Destruction of Sennacherib). In the ninth, eighth and seventh centuries BCE, Assyrian armies marched out from their homeland in northern Iraq to Iran in the East, Egypt in the West, the Persian Gulf in the south and central Turkey in the north, and they created the largest empire known up until that time. They built impressive palaces and cities, created great works of art and have left us a vast number of documents preserving ancient literature and scholarly knowledge. In the course we will look at the structure of the Assyrian state, Assyrian culture, the development of the Assyrian empire, and its sudden collapse at the end of the seventh century. While the course will emphasize the use of textual sources, archaeological and iconographic data will also be used to help us arrive at an understanding of the great achievements of the ancient Assyrians. The classes will be part lecture and part seminar.",

We will focus more specifically on that smaller Middle Eastern piece of the empire known as the Il-Khanate, which merely stretched from Turkey to Afghanistan, and made Iran a locus for synthesizing the cultures of Iran, the Arab world, Central Asia, and China.

Egypt is renowned for the ubiquitous images of its Pharaohs: divine kings who ruled Egypt under the divine sanction of the gods. The king was only the top of a vast pyramid of powerful officials which included viziers, treasurers, military leaders, local governors, town mayors and scribes. The course aims to investigate the ways in which the rulership of Egypt worked: from the highest levels of royal power down to the running of towns and villages. In the first part of the course we will explore the nature of the Pharaoh and his role as the supreme political and religious leader in the country. We will continue by looking at the activities of the royal family and central government working our way into an examination of how Egypt's provinces were run by local noble families (the \"nomarchs\"-who could often become as powerful as the king himself). At a lower level, but perhaps more important in the daily lives of most ancient Egyptians, we will look at the administration of cities, towns and villages by local headmen and mayors. Other topics we will delve into will include the role of the temples; crime and punishment; the military; the lifestyles of Egypt's rich and powerful, as well as the ways in which Egypt's rulers could be rapidly altered through revolution, coups and assassinations. Our ultimate goal will be an appreciation of both the successes and failures of the lords of the Nile in ruling their country over the remarkable time span of 3000 years.",

What was the nature of canon and authority in early Israel and Judaism, and how did biblical communities think about their sacred texts? How and what did the Bible mean to ancient readers? The answers to these questions are varied and surprising. This course looks at early biblical and Jewish texts that both write and re-write the tradition's own central texts. We will think widely and creatively about ancient textuality, orality, interpretation, composition, and authority. Drawing on literary theory, the course will examine the ways that biblical and post-biblical literature from the Second Temple to the rabbinic period (with some forays into contemporary literature) manifest complex ideas about power, meaning, and religiousity in early Judaism.",

    "course_description" : "Christianity and Judaism are often called \"Biblical religions\" because they are believed to be founded upon the Bible. But the truth of the matter is that it was less the Bible itself than the particular ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Christians and Jews that shaped the development of these two religions and that also marked the difference between them. So, too, ancient Biblical interpretation --Jewish and Christian-- laid the groundwork for and developed virtually all the techniques and methods that have dominated literary criticism and hermeneutics (the science of interpretation) since then. The purpose of this course is to study some of the more important ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Jews and Christians before the modern period, and particularly in the first six centuries in the common era. We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom, Kermode, Derrida, Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods. All readings are in English translation, and will include selections from Philo of Alexandria, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic midrash, the New Testament and early Church Fathers, Gnostic writings, Origen, and Augustine. No previous familiarity with Biblical scholarship is required although some familiarity with the Bible itself would be helpful.",

The readings thus include not only the works of Hellenized philosophers (falasifa) of Islam, but also those of theologians (mutakallimun), legists (fiqh scholars), and grammarians (nahw/lugha scholars).

First we will examine the \"origin\" of cities, focusing on several of the places where cities first developed, including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today.",

The inside humor of an ethnic group is accessible to its members; it draws upon their respective social structures, historical and social experiences, languages, cultural symbols, and social and economic circumstances and aspirations. The external humor of an ethnic group targets members of other ethnic groups, and draws upon their stereotypes, and attributed characteristics by other ethnic groups. The external ethnic humor flourishes in immigrant and ethnically heterogenic societies. In both cases jokes and humor are an integral part of social interaction, and in their performance relate to the social, economic, and political dynamics of traditional and modern societies.",

Sufi philosophies, liturgical practices, and social organizations have been a major part of the Islamic tradition in all historical periods, and Sufism has also served as a primary muse behind Islamic aesthetic expression in poetry, music, and the visual arts. In this course, we will explore the various significations of Sufism by addressing both the world of ideas and socio-cultural practices. The course is divided into three broad sections: central themes and concepts going back to the earliest individuals who identified themselves as Sufis; Sufi metaphysics and epistemology as exemplified in the work of Ibn al-'Arabi and his school, and literary expressions as exemplified in the epic poem Layla and Majnun by Nizami, The Conference of the Birds by Attar, and in the life and poetry of Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi. In studying this material, we will be concerned equally with establishing common patterns and seeing how being a Sufi has meant different things to various people over the course of history.",

We will explore the definition of the new Israeli hero from Paul Newman as Ari Ben Canaan in \"Exodus\" personifying the new Israeli Jew all the way to the self-doubting, haunted Ari Folman in \"Waltz with Bashir\". We will look at how the Sephardi Jews from Arab countries are looked down on in the cinema of the Seventies and are searching for their identity today as well as how Israeli cinema has portrayed Arabs from straightforward enemies to possible partners. We will look at the ever-changing role of woman in Israeli films. We will also question the essence of Jewish identity in Israeli cinema and the effect 3,000 years of a complex history have on the modern day hero.",

For much of the first millenium BC, the empires based in these three cities defines the history of Western Asia, providing much of the economic, political and cultural context for developments from Greece to India. This course will explore the history of the Ancient near East from ca. 900-63 BC. We will evaluate the archaeological evidence for four empires -- the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians and the Seleucid Empire. Using Penn's unrivaled museum collections, students will examine topics including imperialism, cultural hybiridity, trade and interaction, and the construction and use of tradition and memory.",

All texts will be in translation from Yiddish and Hebrew, or in English. Through a variety of genres--devotional literature, memoir, fiction, and poetry -- we will study women's roles and selves, the relation of women and men, and the interaction between Jewish texts and women's lives. The legacy of women in Yiddish devotional literature will serve as background for our reading of modern Jewish fiction & poetry from the past century. The course is divided into five segments. The first presents a case study of the Matriarchs Rachel and Leah, as they are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, in rabbinic commentary, in pre-modern prayers, and in modern poems. We then examine a modern novel that recasts the story of Dinah, Leah's daughter. Next we turn to the seventeenth century Glikl of Hamel, the first Jewish woman memoirist. The third segment focuses on devotional literature for and by women. In the fourth segment, we read modern women poets in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. The course concludes with a fifth segment on fiction and a memoir written by women in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. \"Jewish woman, who knows your life? In darkness you have come, in darkness do you go.\" J. L. Gordon (1890)",

But the truth of the matter is that it was less the Bible itself than the particular ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Christians and Jews that shaped the development of these two religions and that also marked the difference between them. So, too, ancient Biblical interpretation --Jewish and Christian-- laid the groundwork for and developed virtually all the techniques and methods that have dominated literary criticism and hermeneutics (the science of interpretation) since then. The purpose of this course is to study some of the more important ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Jews and Christians before the modern period, and particularly in the first six centuries in the common era. We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom, Kermode, Derrida, Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods. All readings are in English translation, and will include selections from Philo of Alexandria, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic midrash, the New Testament and early Church Fathers, Gnostic writings, Origen, and Augustine. No previous familiarity with Biblical scholarship is required although some familiarity with the Bible itself would be helpful.",

    "course_description" : "The famous boy king Tutanhkamun ascended the throne of Egypt at around ten years of age. His brief reign (1332-1332 BCE) came at the end of a tumultuous period in Egyptian history known to scholars today as the Amarna Period. Ushered in by his probable father, Akhenaten, the Amarna Period saw incredible changes in the traditional religion, art, architecture and language of ancient Egypt all brough about as a result of Akhenaten's devotion to a sole god, the Aten. What was Egyptian culture like before these kings? How abrupt was the chnage Akhenaten initiated? Why did it occur and why did Tutankhamun eventually reverse these changes? These and other questions will be addressed as we look at the Egyptian 18th Dynasty, the time when Egyptian civilization went through a period of upheavel and restoration. This Spring, a new exhibit on the Amarna period (\"Amarna: Ancient Egypt's Place in the Sun\") is on display at the Penn Museum. At the same time, the city of Philadelphia is host to the blockbuster traveling exhibit, \"Tutankhamun and the gold Age of the Pharaohs\" which comes to the Franklin Institute in February 2006. This course will make use of both of these exhibits and will focus on this fascinating period of time during which King Tut lived and reigned, Egypt's New Kingdom (1539-1075 BCE).",

From the conquests of Alexander the Great to the end of Roman rule in late antiquity, this region was the scene of conflicts, but also of peaceful and fruitful interactions between Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Jews, Syrians, Arabs and many other societies. What was the impact of Greek and Roman rule and how did the inhabitants of the region react to these fundamental changes? On the other hand, how did they influence the culture and worldview of their conquerors? We will use historical texts, documents and archaeological evidence to discuss the political, cultural and religious encounters that made the Near East a key region of Greco-Roman history. All texts will be discussed in translation. No prerequisites, although it would be useful to have taken ANCH 026 and/or ANCH 027.",

    "course_description" : "In the tenth century, a scholar named Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq produced an Arabic manuscript called Kitab al-Tabikh (\"The Book of Cooking\".) This volume, which compiled and discussed the recipes of eighth-and ninth-century Islamic rulers (caliphs) and their courts in Iraq, represents the oldest known surviving cookbook of the Arab-Islamic world. Many more such cookbooks followed; in their day they represented an important literary genre among cultured elites. As one food historian recently noted, \"there are more cookbooks in Arabic from before 1400 than in the rest of the world's languages put together\". This course will take the study of Ibn Sayyar's cookbook as its starting point for examining the cultural dynamics of food. The focus will be on the Middle East across the sweep of the Islamic era, into the modern period, and until the present day, although many of the readings will consider the study of food in other places (including the contemporary United States) for comparative insights. The class will use the historical study of food and \"foodways\" as a lens for examining subjects that relate to a wide array of fields and interests. These subjects include politics, economics, agricultural and environmental studies, anthropology, literature, religion, and public health. With regard to the modern era, the course will pay close attention to the social consequences of food in shaping memories and identities - including religious, ethnic, national, and gender-based identities - particularly among people who have dispersed or otherwise migrated.",

The narrow goal of the course is to understand the spiritual dimensions of Islamic religious leadership and the variety of its manifestations in the intellectual life; social organizations, and regional diversification of the Islamic world.

We will reconstruct the intertwined mercantile, religious and kinship networks that spanned the Indian Ocean world, across the Middle East, East Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and China, illuminating the histories of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, while also considering the role of successive imperial political formations, from Rome to Britain. Throughout the semester we will seek to understand the Indian Ocean through the people who lived and worked in its milieu - from consuls and militaty commanders, to traders, brokers, sailers, prisoners and slaves. Course materials will draw on a variety of discuplines (anthroplogy, archaeology, material culture, religious studies) to construct the cultural, economic, and environmental history of the Indian Ocean. By the end of the course, students will also have a good understanding of the historical geography of the Indian Ocean region; the shifting nature of cross-regional interactions over time in that region; and the way this region contributes to continuing change in global political economy",

Reading history as a set of local contingencies, the course examines the influence of these different disciplines upon each other, and the process of the Islamic \"aspecting\" of the Greek intellectual legacy. The readings thus include not only the works of Hellenized philosophers (falasifa) of Islam, but also those of theologians (mutakallimun), legists (fiqh-writers), and grammarians (nahw/lugha-writers).

The seminar focuses on the holy city of Jerusalem, exploring the events leading to its demise in 70 CE at Roman hands and its fate in the centuries that followed. We will examine the complex history and symbolic legacy of the city in the Jewish and Christian imaginations--from the formative period of early Christianity when Jerusalem was at the forefront of contention between the two groups, to the relative demise of attention to the city in Jewish and Christian thought during the 2nd and 3rd centuries under pagan Roman rule, to the revival of interest in the 4th century under Roman Emperor Constantine, with the appropriation of Jerusalem as a Christian city in a Christian world. Following the fascinating transmutations in the history of the holy city, this course explores the exchange of ideas between adherents of both Judaism and Christianity in this ancient cradle of their pasts.",

As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies, in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face, and in large-scale, often industrial societies, in which the themes, symbols, and forms that permeate traditional life, occupy new positions, or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture, or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others, these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies, and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically, professionally, or culturally, within modern heterogeneous societies, and traditional societies in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and Australia,folkore plays a more prominent role in society, than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents. Consequently the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies and any society that is in a transitional phase.",

For much of the first millenium BC, the empires based in these three cities defines the history of Western Asia, providing much of the economic, political and cultural context for developments from Greece to India.

Using Penn's unrivaled museum collections, students will examine topics including imperialism, cultural hybiridity, trade and interaction, and the construction and use of tradition and memory.",

This course explores both the critiques of Jewish Law, and Jewish reflections on the Law's meaning and purpose, by examining a range of primary sources within their intellectual and historical contexts. Texts (in English translation) include selections from Midrash, Talmud, medieval Jewish philosophy and biblical exegesis, kabbalah, Hasidic homilies, Jewish responses to the Enlightenment, and contemporary attempts to re-value and invent Jewish rituals.",

The course seeks to foster an appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia, an understanding of cultural continuities in the Middle East and a sense of the ancient Near Eastern underpinnings of western civilization.

It has been on the cutting edge of developments in Arabic literature, movies, and music, and has produced intellectual leaders ranging from feminists to Muslim activists. In the 1950s and '60s, the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser inspired the pan-Arab movement and at the same time made his country a central player in postcolonial Africa. Meanwhile, Egypt led the Arab countries in opposing the state of Israel until breaking ranks in 1978 to sign peace accords at Camp David. In this class, we will approach the history of twentieth-century Egypt through the lives of a spectrum of its peoples, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews; presidents and peasants; singers, writers, and radical thinkers. Along the way we will examine the social pressures that have inspired modern Egyptian revolutionaries and militants, and attempt to explain the reasons for the country's continuing prominence in the Arab and Muslim worlds.",

Although inclusive of the military battles and conflicts that have affected the region, this course will move beyond the cliches of war and conflict in the Middle East to show the range of issues and ideas with which intellectuals and governments grappled throughout the century. The cultural politics and economic value of oil as well as the formation of a vibrant literary life will be among the topics covered in the course. Ty considering illustrative cultural moments that shed light on the political history of the period, this course will adopt a nuanced framework to approach the Arab/Israeli conflict, the history of the Gulf States, the Iran-Iraq War, and U.S. involvement in the region.",

The course will begin by examining notions of power in the Qur'an, and then turn to the career of the Prophet Muhammad. Much of the course will then be devoted to a consideration of the formation of the institution of the caliphate and of resistance of various kinds to caliphal legitimacy and authority. Medieval responses to the caliphate and its waning will also be considered, as well as the distinctive contribution of Iranian ideas and the Iranian heritage to Islamic political thought. The course will conclude with a brief consideration of some contemporary appropriations of the tradition. (This course will not cover the important, but arguably discrete topic of the reception of Greek political thought in the Islamic intellectual tradition.) The majority of the readings consist of translations of primary Arabic and Persian sources. Due consideration will be given to the literary character of these sources, as well as to the question of the limits of the qualifiers \"Islamic\" and \"Muslim\" in regard to the political ideas that emerge from the readings.",

It does so while drawing on archives, rare books and manuscripts, and artifacts that are now preserved in the University Archives, the Penn Museum, and the Penn Libraries. Together we will consider how, beginning in the late nineteenth century, Penn scholars engaged in archaeological expeditions to celebrated sites like Ur (in what is now Iraq) and Memphis (in Egypt) and how some of these efforts influenced the late Ottoman Empire s policies towards antiquities and museums. We will examine how Penn s curriculum changed over time to accommodate Semitics , including the study of languages and biblical traditions, in light of or in spite of historic tensions at the university between secular and religious learning. We will assess how Penn responded to changing American popular attitudes and U.S. foreign policy concerns relative to the Middle East, including during the Cold War and post-2001 ( post-9/11 ) eras. Finally, we will trace the stories or biographies of some individual objects in Penn collections in order to appreciate the university s roles in collecting, preserving, analyzing, and disseminating knowledge about the region s deep cultural heritage.

Often simplified as a bridge between East and West, we will instead examine the role played by the past in the formation of a modern nation-state. In other words, what is the relationship between the ancient and the present of this Middle Eastern country? Themes such as Turkish nationalism, secularism and Islam, Turkey's ethnic minorities, modernization and traditions, will guide our lectures, discussions and readings throughout the semester. As we evaluate the impact of history and archaeology on contemporary Turkish culture and identity, students will read across the social sciences, incorporating literature, cinema, music, and food, in order to complement their classroom experience with a lived awareness of the country.",

Introductory sessions will familiarize students with the history of Persian literature, especially the transition away from classical modes of representation, a tradition that was largely poetic, to modern genres and forms, including the novel, blank-verse poetry, and short stories. However, most of the course will be organized thematically rather than chronologically, and each unit will bring together literary texts from both the classical and modern traditions. Together we will examine how authors from different historical periods have utilized a limited number of motifs in order to represent and critique the dominant religious and social institutions of their time. We will conclude by considering the rapid politicalization of Persian literature in the 20th century and recent efforts to control systems of representation, and especially the written word, in the Islamic Republic of Iran.",

In Part I we examine the key historical antecednets to the rise of the so-called 'gunpowder' empires from c.1500 to c.1800. Part II of the course surveys the major gunpowder empires individually, beginning with the Ottomans, followed by the Safavids and then the Mughals. Finally, in Part III we more explicitly pursue a comparative perspective by looking at cross-cutting themes, including early state building, adminitrative cenralization, the structure of production and exchange, urbanism and courtly culture, gender, and the management of religio-cultural difference.",

Introductory sessions will familiarize students with the history of Persian literature, especially the transition away from classical modes of representation, a tradition that was largely poetic, to modern genres and forms, including the novel, blank-verse poetry, and short stories. However, most of the course will be organized thematically rather than chronologically, and each unit will bring together literary texts from both the classical and modern traditions. Together we will examine how authors from different historical periods have utilized a limited number of motifs in order to represent and critique the dominant religious and social institutions of their time. We will conclude by considering the rapid politicalization of Persian literature in the 20th century and recent efforts to control systems of representation, and especially the written word, in the Islamic Republic of Iran.",

In many ways, Central and South Asia taken together form a microcosm of world history: the meeting of overland and oceanic histories; the meeting of agrarian and nomadic empires; the point where east and west met in the cold war. Our questions for this course are: how have Central Asia and South Asia been interlinked - and sometimes delinked - since the rise of Islam until now? And what can this shifting relationship tell us about topics in world history more broadly? The course is both an introduction to the long-term history of Central and South Asia, and an introduction to ways of thinking about themes in world history.",

Yet these are only a very few of the many fascinating -- and at time perplexing -- aspects of the civilizations that flourished there c. 3300-300 BCE. This is where writing first developed, where people thought that the gods wrote down what would happen in the future on the lungs and livers of sacrificed sheep, and where people knew how to determine the length of hypotenuse a thousand years before the Greek Pythagoras was born. During this course, we will learn more about these other matters and discover their place in the cultures and civilizations of that area. This is an interdisciplinary survey of the history, society and culture of the ancient Near East, in particular Egypt and Mesopotamia, utilizing extensive readings from ancient texts in translation (including the Epic of Gilgamesh, \"one of the great masterpieces of world literature\"), but also making use of archaeological and art historical materials. The goal of the course is to gain an appreciation of the various societies of the time, to understand some of their great achievements, to become acquainted with some of the fascinating individuals of the time (such as Hatshepsut, \"the women pharaoh,\" and Akhenaten, \"the heretic king\"), and to appreciate the rich heritage that they have left us.",

This course is in seminar format to encourage lively discussion and is team-taught by four professors whose expertise in modern Middle Eastern literature serves to create a deeper understanding and aesthetic appreciation of each literary tradition. In addition to honing students' literary analysis skills, the course will enable students to become more adept at discussing the social and political forces that are reflected in Middle Eastern literature, explore important themes and actively engage in reading new Middle Eastern works on their own in translation.

It takes place in the new Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials (CAAM) and is team taught in three modules: human skeletal analysis, analysis of animal remains, and analysis of plant remains. Each module will combine laboratory and classroom exercises to give students hands-on experience with archaeological materials. We will examine how organic materials provide key information about past environments, human behavior, and cultural change through discussions of topics such as health and disease, inequality, and food.",

The literature of ancient Mesopotamia flourished thousands of years ago in a culture all of its own, yet the survival of hundreds of thousands of written records challenges us to read it and make sense of it without simply approximating it to the realm of our own understanding. How can we learn to do this? Situating our understanding of how we read and how we understand culture within an interdisciplinary range of literary-critical and analytic approaches, we will approach this question by immersing ourselves in the myths tales and mentalities that made Mesopotamian literature meaningful. To give us a measure of our progress we will bracket the semester by reading Gilgamesh which is never less than a great story, but which will take on new layers of meaning as the semester develops and we learn to read the text in more and more Mesopotamian ways. As we journey through these mysterious realms we will reflect not only Mesopotamia and its immortal literature but on what it means to read and understand any cultures other than our own.",
