Geologic processes make our planet dynamic, as mountains are built and eroded; oceans are created and destroyed; and continents collide and diverge. Yet, despite its changing nature or perhaps because of it, Earth has also been a platform for the evolution of life for 3.5 billion years. This course will examine earth materials and processes and compare our planet to our neighbors. We will examine processes such as weathering and sedimentation; plate tectonics; and the rock cycle. We will also learn to identify minerals and rocks and learn how we can use them to read Earth's history. We will interpret the two-dimensional representations (maps and sections) that geologists use to document the geologic record. Throughout the course, participants will be asked to develop lesson plans and activities to communicate these concepts to their own students.",

Relative sea-level histories are important for calibrating and constraining geophysical models of Earth's rheology and the isostatic adjustment of Earth to ice and water loads. Sea level is crucial to any study of coastal evolution as it serves as the ultimate baseline for continental denudation. The stability of sea level in recent past has been an important factor in sustaining coastal communities and may have profoundly influenced the very initiation of human civilization. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently re-emphasized the importance of sea level as a barometer of climate and drew attention to the potentially devastating consequences of future climate change. However, the IPCC also highlighted the uncertainty with which the driving mechanisms of recent sea-level change are understood and the disconnect between long-term geological and recent observational trends. In this course we will begin to fill this important knowledge gap.",

The framework of WM must contain elements of good science, variable spatial scales, and long term horizons. We will study the physical and biological processes involved: the influences of geology, soils, and climate, and of man's land management practices on watershed and stream geomorphology. Basic principles of hydrology will be dealt with at some length, using the equation of hydrologic balance (aka the water budget equation) as the organizing framework to follow and quantitatively describe the continuous movement of water through the hydrologic cycle, and to understand man's impacts on the hydrologic regimens of watersheds. There will be a particular emphasis on stormwater and floodplain management issues.",

However, it is not possible to make meaningful predictions of future climates without understanding the forces that have controlled past climates.

It will involve analysis and modeling of various sedimentary environments, systems, and processes.

Once familiar with the models, the student can continue to work with them beyond the course experience. PHREEQC is designed to perform a wide variety of aqueous geochemical calculations and can be used to simulate chemical reactions and transport processes in natural or polluted waters. PHREEQC is capable of modeling both equilibrium and kinetic reactions. Some of the simulations pursued during the course include: Speciation of precipitation water; Iron speciation; Zinc sorption onto hydrous ferric oxide; Oxidation of organic carbon and the sequence of electron donors in natural waters; Benzene advective transport in g",

What is the fate of organic matter produced by biological production and what are the impacts of this organic matter on the ocean and underlying sediments?",

What controls the composition of seawater and are humans changing it? Theme #3. What are the chemical constraints on biological production in the ocean? Theme #4. What is the fate of organic matter produced by biological production and what are th eimpacts of this organic matter on the ocean and underlying sediments.",

In this course, students will acquire hands-on experience on some of the procedures employed to study the coastal system through practical fieldwork and applied laboratory research methodology.",
