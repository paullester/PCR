Development of international accounting principles (the standard setting process) and comparative practices are reviewed at the outset of the course. This is followed by discussion and resolution of several technical subjects which are used as a vehicle for further consideration of comparative practices. Inflation accounting and foreign currency translation, two subjects of importance to international business, are treated. Subjects of a managerial nature (such as accounting for hedging transaction losses by using forward contracts, management control in the foreign environment, analysis of foreign financial statements, transfer pricing and international taxation) consume most of the second half of the course.",

Relying prior knowledge, the course aims in six weeks to help students become effective users of financial statements. The first day of the course reviews the preparation of the statement of cash flows and assumes the student can prepare a balance sheer and income statement. The remainder of the course examines the major asset liabilities and shareholders' equity accounts using examples and problems extracted directly from published financial statements. The goal of the course is to allow students to begin interpreting and analyzing real financial statements. Inactive",

To probe the matter of comparative practices we will review several important areas including the accounting and reporting for: 1) consolidations; 2) leases; 3) foreign exchange gains or losses; 4) deferred income taxes; 5) inflation; 6) pension costs.

The course is especially useful for anyone interested in working on the buy or sell side. The course provides both a framework for and the tools necessary to analyze financial statements. At the conceptual level, it emphasizes that preparers and users of financial statements have different objectives and incentives. At the same time, the course is applied and stresses the use of actual financial statements. For example, students learn how to detect when firms are managing earnings and/or balance sheets.
