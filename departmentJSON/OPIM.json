    "course_description" : "The service sector represents the largest segment of most industrial economies. In the U.S., for example, it accounts for approximately 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. In addition to this \"pure\" service sector, the operations and competitive positions of many manufacturing firms are becoming increasingly service-oriented. While operational excellence is critical for success in most industries today, in a wide range of service industries this is particularly true. For example, recent, significant deregulation in banking, health care, and communications has led to intensified competition and pressure on operations. At the same time, the rapid evolution of information technology has enabled firms to operate in a fashion - and offer a level of service - that has not been previously possible. Elements common to most services make the management of their operations complex, however. In particular, services are intangible, not storable or transportable, and often highly variable. Frequently their delivery involves distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact. All of these factors make service opertions end up looking quite a bit different than manufacturing operations, and the task of achieving excellence in them requires specialized analysis frameworks and tools. This course covers a mix of qalitative and quantitative models that provide the necessary tools. The class will focus on simple models that should help you to better understand both the difficulty of managing and the underlying economics of the service operations being considered. You will have the opportunity to apply these course tools in a group service assessment field project.",

Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs, but \"industrial strength\" applications typically use more sophisticated tools, based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes, rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering), as are the business analytic methods covered in the course.

    "course_description" : "This class provides a high-level introduction to the field of judgment and decision making (JDM) and in-depth exposure to the process of doing research in this area. Throughout the semester you will gain hands-on experience with several different JDM research projects. You will be paired with a PhD student or faculty mentor who is working on a variety of different research studies. Each week you will be given assignments that are central to one or more of these studies, and you will be given detailed descriptions of the research projects you are contributing to and how your assignments relate to the successful completion of these projects. To complement your hands-on research experience, throughout the semester you will be assigned readings from the book Nudge by Thaler and Sunstein, which summarizes key recent ideas in the JDM literature. You will also meet as a group for an hour once every three weeks with the class's faculty supervisor and all of his or her PhD students to discuss the projects you are working on, to discuss the class readings, and to discuss your own research ideas stimulated by getting involved in various projects. Date and time to be mutually agreed upon by supervising faculty and students. the 1CU version of this course will involve approx. 10 hours of research immersion per week and a 10-page paper. The 0.5 CU version of this course will involve approx 5 hours of research immersion per week and a 5-page final paper.

Matching supply to demand is easiest when a firm has a flexible supply process, but flexibility is generally expensive. In this course we wll 1) learn how to assess the apprppriate level of supply flexibility for a given industry and 2) explore stategies for economically increasing a firm's supply flexibility. While tactical models and decisions are part of this course, the emphasis is on the qualitative insights needed by general managers or management consultants.

Likewise, the abundance of unfulfilled needs in the health care marketplace has led to an array of technology ventures with innovative new products and services. In this course, we apply the tools of operations management to analyze the health care value chain. The course consists of four modules: (1) the management of productivity, quality, and variability by care providers, (2) capacity and investment decisions under uncertainty confronting pharmaceuticals, (3) the design of health insurance by health plans and the determination of health benefits by employers, and (4) business ideas and operations models from the intersection of academic research and technology ventures. Students will learn from case discussions, hands-on decision tools, and several distinguished speakers and alumni from Stanford Hospital & Clinics, Merck, U.S. Naval Academy, and Deloitte Consulting. No prior exposure to the health care industry is assumed. The course prepares students for several career paths including consulting, operations management, and health care administration and is open to both first- and second-year MBA students.",

Retailing is a huge industry that has consistently been an incubator for new business concepts. This course will examine how retailers understand their customers' preferences and respond with appropriate products through effective supply chain management. Supply chain management is vitally important for retailers and has been noted as the source of success for many retailers such as Wal-mart and Home Depot, and as an inhibitor of success for e-tailers as they struggle with delivery reliability.

They also include such applied matters as design of logistics systems, auctions, and markets generally (for example, markets for electric power generation). In addressing these topics we focus on the practical problem of finding effective strategies for agents in strategic situations (or games). Our method of exploration will be experimental: we review and discuss experiments, principally computational experiments, on the behavior of boundedly rational agents in strategic (or game-theoretic) situations. Course work includes readings, discussions in class (organized as a seminar), examinations, and a course project on a topic chosen by the participants.",

    "course_description" : "Operational performance has long been emphasized as a key driver of firm value in the basic materials industries (e.g., steel or paper) as well as in mature and highly competitive manufacturing industries (e.g., automotive or personal computers). In contrast, industries such as financial services, healthcare, or pharmaceuticals have enjoyed sufficiently high margins that operational performance only recently began receiving significant managerial attention. Given its emergence as a relatively new topic in these industries, managers and consultants often struggle with questions such as \"What performance measures should we track?\", \"How do operational performance measures impact the bottom line performance?\", or \"How do we go about improving processes to achieve various operational performance improvements, including cost savings, lead-time reduction, or increases in product variety?\" Even in more mature industries, managers often struggle to correctly prioritize operational improvement initiatives and to link them directly to financial performance. The objective of the course is to provide students with a set of tools that supports them in analyzing the operational performance of a company and to guide them in increasing the overall value of the firm by improving its operations. Specifically, we will discuss how to: 1. Develop an integrated model linking operational performance measures to financial value; 2. Analyze indicators of opportunities for operational improvement; 3. Identify levers (techniques) to improve operational performance; 4. Value potential operational improvements, both individually as well as collectively.",

There are many reasons for this development: the emergence of a whole range of new complex financial instruments, innovations in securitization, the increased globalization of the financial markets, the proliferation of information technology and the rise of high-frequency traders, etc. In this course, models for hedging, asset allocation, and multi-period portfolio planning are developed, implemented, and tested. In addition, pricing models for options, bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other derivatives are studied. The models typically require the tools of statistics, optimization, and/or simulation, and they are implemented in spreadsheets or a high-level modeling environment, MATLAB. This course is quantitative and will require extensive computer use. The course is intended for students who have strong interest in finance. The objective is to provide students the necessary practical tools they will require should they choose to join the financial services industry, particularly in roles such as: derivatives, quantitative trading, portfolio management, structuring, financial engineering, risk management, etc. Prospective students should be comfortable with quantitative methods quantitative methods, such as basic statistics and the methodologies (mathematical programming and simulation) taught in OPIM612 Business Analytics or OPIM321 Management Science (or equivalent).

The course class sections will deal with the following major items: (1) linking finance and operations in retailing, (2) what assortment of products should a retailer carry in each store, (3) optimizing the inventory carried of each SKU in each store, (4) markdown pricing, (5) store execution and (6) supply chain design. In addition, we will consider a broad range of issues facing two retailers, Mothers Work, and Best Buy, when we are visited by current and past senior executives from these firms. The course is highly recommended for students interested in careers in: (1) Retailing and retail supply chains, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting and information technology that provide services to retail firms, (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retail firms. Even if you don't expect to work for a retailer, this course can be useful to you in two ways. First, because retailers are such dominant players in many supply chains today, it is important that the processes they follow be understood by manufacturers and distributors, or by the consultants and bankers that service retailers and their suppliers. Second, the problems retailers face (e.g., making data accessible, interpreting large amounts of data, reducing lead-times, eliciting the best efforts from employees, and so forth), are shared by firms in many other industries. It's easier to understand these issues through case studies in retailing because we all experience the industry as consumers and can readily relate to chronic problems such as stock outs and markdowns. The course will be highly interactive, using case discussions in more than half of the classes and including senior retail executives in a number of the class sessions.",

This relatively recent and now rapidly-developing form of computer simulation seeks to explain and predict complex social phenomena \"from the ground up\", through interactions of comparatively simple agents. The course reviews experimental and theoretical results, and exposes the students to modern development environments for this form of simulation. Students have the opportunity to design and implement agent-based simulations. Programming, however, is not required. This course aims to integrate various topics in agent-based simulation, while developing an appreciation of the problems that are particularly characteristic of this form of simulation so that students will understand its promise and potential.",

These methods give students a conceptual framekwork for understanding the linkage between how a firm manages its supply and how well that supply matches the firm's resulting demand.

This course will study the many questions that arise in the management of such global supply chains, including: Which design and production activities to do in-house and which to outsource? Where to locate various activities around the world? How to forecast the many factors that influence these decisions, including inflation in cost factors such as labor and freight, and the likelihood of future government regulation or political instability? How to keep the supply chain flexible so as to adapt to change? How to manage a geographically disbursed supply chain, including what relationships to have with vendors to ensure low cost, high quality, flexibility, safety, humane labor practices and respect for sustainability of the environment? The course is highly interactive, using case discussions in most classes and senior supply chain executives in many sessions. Grades are based one-third each on class participation, indivudla write-ups of the discussion questions for 3 of the class sessions, and a course paper.",

The purpose of this course is to improve understanding of technology (what it can or cannot enable) and the business drivers of technology-related decisions in firms. We will be discussing some of the new and most disruptive technologies right now to stimulate thought on new applications for commerce and new ventures, as well as their implications to the tech industry as a whole. Topics include social media, online advertising, big data, and cloud computing. *IN SPRING 2015 THIS COURSE WILL BE OFFERED AS A FULL-CU COURSE THAT ONLY MEETS DURING Q3. WE WILL MEET TWICE A WEEK FOR 3 HOURS PER DAY TO ENSURE THAT THE TOTAL CLASSROOM TIME IS THE SAME AS OTHER 1-CU COURSES. THIS FORMAT WILL FREE UP TIME FOR STUDENTS TO WORK ON COURSE PROJECTS DURING Q4. WE WILL NOT HAVE REGULAR CLASS TIME IN Q4 AS A RESULT.* The course will take a layered approach (from network infrastructure) to data infrastructure to applications infrastructure, or direct enablers of commerce) to first, understanding and then, thinking about technology enablers. Network infrastructure layers include fundamentals of wired and wireless infrastructure technologies such as protocols for networking, broadband technologies - for last (DSL, Cable etc) and other miles (advances in optical networking) and digital cellular communications. Data infrastructure layers include usage tracking technologies, search technologies and data mining. Direct application layers include personalization technologies (CRM), design technologies for content and exchanges, software renting enablers, application service provision, agents and security mechanisms. Finally some emberging technology enablers (such as bluetooth, biometrics and virtual reality) are identified and discussed.",

First, it seeks to introduce simple models and ideas that provide powerful (and oftentimes surprising) qualitative insights about a large spectrum of managerial problems. Its main topics include linear and integer programming, decision making under uncertainty, and simulation. Second, it aims to give a feeling for the kinds of problems that can be tackled quantitatively, the methods and software available for doing so and the difficulties involved in gathering the relevant data. the emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse industries and functions areas, including finance, operations, accounting, and marketing.",

Beginning with the second week of class, if you miss one class you lose a letter grade. If you miss two classes you fail. We have this policy because it is an experiential class, and because your attendance directly affects classmates you are paired with. For some weeks you can attend another section if necessary.

    "course_description" : "Quantitative methods have become fundamental tools in the analysis and planning of financial operations. There are many reasons for this development: the emergence of a whole range of new complex financial instruments, innovations in securitization, the increased globalization of the financial markets, the proliferation of information technology and the rise of high-frequency traders, etc. In this course, models for hedging, asset allocation, and multi-period portfolio planning are developed, implemented, and tested. In addition, pricing models for options, bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other derivatives are studied. The models typically require the tools of statistics, optimization, and/or simulation, and they are implemented in spreadsheets or a high-level modeling environment, MATLAB. This course is quantitative and will require extensive computer use. The course is intended for students who have strong interest in finance. The objective is to provide students the necessary practical tools they will require should they choose to join the financial services industry, particularly in roles such as: derivatives, quantitative trading, portfolio management, structuring, financial engineering, risk management, etc. Prospective students should be comfortable with quantitative methods such as basic statistics and the methodologies (mathematical programming and simulation) taugh tin OPIM612 Business Analytics and OPIM321 Management Science (or equivalent).

However, the course also extends principles and practices used in innovation and new product development to information technologies in general and the Web in particular. For example, design-for-manufacturing is addressed with open-source software and Web services. Robust Engineering and Design of Experiments is applied to paper prototyping and server log analysis. The course is an interdisciplinary, integrative project-based course. Through weekly assignments, students apply the tools and techniques to the design of a new product, culminating in the initial roll-out of a working service.

Mathematical optimization provides a unifying framework for studying issues of rational decision-making, optimal design, effective resource allocation and economic efficiency. It is a central methodology of many business-related disciplines, including operations research, marketing, accounting, economics, game theory and finance. In many of the disciplines, a solid background in optimization theory is essential for doing research. This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamental theory of optimization. It examines optimization theory in two primary settings: static optimization and optimization over time (dynamic programming). Applications from problem areas in which optimization plays a key role are also introduced. The goal of the course is to provide students with a foundation sufficient to use basic optimization in their own research work and/or to pursue more specialized studies involving optimization theory. The course is designed for entering doctoral students. The prerequisites are calculus, linear algebra and some familiarity with real analysis, as covered in summer math camp. Other concepts are developed as needed throughout the course.",

So then, at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures, and why in spite of it, systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views, differences in experience and training, and over long periods of time. More than anything else, within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design, this course treats communication, corroboration, and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects.",
