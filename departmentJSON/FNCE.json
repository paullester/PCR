Finally, we will consider distressed debt as an asset class and develop techniques for investing in distressed securities. The course will provide students with tools to value distressed companies, understand the legalframework governing bankruptcy and reorganization in the U.S. and other countries, and navigate the key strategic issues facing managers and investors in distressed companies. It will also provide students with a specialized vocabulary and important facts about the restructuring industry, distress investing, and leveraged financial markets.

The main focus of the course will be on the restructuring of financially distressed firms. We'll begin by reviewing the financial instruments commonly used by risky firms (leveraged loans and high-yield bonds) and learn to interpret the contracts that govern them. We'll then survey a variety of restructuring methods (out-of-court workouts, exchange offers, prepackaged and pre-negotiated bankruptcies, Chapter 11 reorganizations, international insolvency practices) available to troubled firms and study the dynamics of the restructuring process through a number of historical and current case studies. Finally, we'll consider distressed debt as an asset class and develop techniques for investing in distressed securities. The course will provide students with tools to value distressed companies, understand the legal framework governing bankruptcy and reorganization, and navigate the key strategic issues facing managers and investors in distressed companies. It willalso provide students with a specialized vocabulary and important facts about the restructuring industry, distress investing, and leveraged financial markets.",

Particular attention will be devoted to exogenous transaction costs, asymmetric information and search frictions as determinants of asset liquidity and, consequently, price. We will also look at liquidity risk, institutional features arising as response to liquidity problems, and financing constraints. The course will concentrate on theoretical models, but the empirical literature will be referred to throughout.",
