It addresses the way artists and designers create images; design with analog and digital tools; communicate, exchange, and express meaning over broad range of media; and find their voices within the fabric of contemporary art, design, and visual culture. Emphasis is placed on building an extended form of visual literacy by studying and making images using a variety of representation techniques; learning to organize and structure two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, and designing with time-based and procedural media. Students learn to develop an individual style of idea-generation, experimentation, iteration, and critique as part of their creative and critical responses to visual",

Yet on this realistic view, our perception is the result of a causal chain that leads from object to eye to brain to experiences, and we are only given the last element: the experience. So how do we really know how our experiences are caused, and where do we get the idea that they are casued by an external world of physical objects?

Over the course of the semester, students will discuss and write about various approaches to vision, examining this contested field through the lenses of several disciplines -- including psychology, philosophy, and art history. By parsing and assimilating diverse ideas, students will decide for themselves what are the most pertinent and relevant approaches to the various avenues of research that present themselves in the emerging interdisciplinary field of Visual Studies.",

Rather than present a unified viewpoint, the course asks the question, \"What is visual studies?\" by examining parallel and sometimes antagonistic approaches to the ways that human beings understand sight and the concept of visuality. Over the course of the semester, students will discuss and write about various approaches to vision, examining this contested field through the lenses of several disciplines -- including psychology, philosophy, and art history. By parsing and assimilating diverse ideas, students will decide for themselves what are the most pertinent and relevant approaches to the various avenues of research that present themselves in the emerging interdisciplinary field of Visual Studies.",

In seeking to understand the nature of minds, philosophers and psychologists have often used metaphors drawn from the forms of technology available to them. Leibniz once described the mind as a mill, while Freud compared the mind to a hydrolytic and electromagnetic system. In our own time, many have followed Alan Turing's proposal and have viewed the mind as a special kind of computer; indeed, this \"Computational Theory of Mind\" forms the foundation for much work in contemporary cognitive science. In this class, we will explore the extent to which the computational theory of mind can adequately characterize the distinctive capacities involved in representing an external environment and having conscious experiences that is displayed by minds in general and human minds in particular. Although an introductory class in philosophy or logic will aid students' understanding, no prior familiarity with the philosophy of mind or cognitive science will be presumed.",
