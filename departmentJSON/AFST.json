    "course_description" : "Sudan is marred by several military conflicts between the state and its citizens not only during colonial times but even after its independence in 1956. The current conflict in Darfu is only one of many wars that ravaged Sudan prior to the ending of Africa's longest civil war (1956-1971, 1983-2005) in the southern part of the country. This course will provide an indepth analysis of the two main conflicts in the Sudan which ends up with the division of the country into two. (1) The first conflict we will study is the Darfur conflict based upon historical and cultural factors, as well as analyzing the ideology of the successive Sudanese states specifically the current government. The course will explore the role of regional and international politics with interest in the ongoing conflict, the \"Genocide\" and ICC controversies, as well as the local militia, the politics of aid in war-torn areas, and the role of Sudan's neighbors in the Darfur conflict and how this could be related to other conflicts in Sudan. (2) The second conflict that we'll cover is the conflict in southern Sudan, which ends up by its secession as an independent country in 2011. This course aims towards the study of the reasons behind these military conflicts and ethnic conflicts that charaterize the modern history of Sudan.",

    "course_description" : "This course will serve as an introduction to a particularly rich arena of literature in English. It will also help students to begin to understand many of the racial subtexts underlying the culture wars in America, where too often in the full glare of cameras, an anguished voice informs the audience that \"as an African, I cannot expect justice in this America.\" One of the things at work here is the assumption of a common Africa diasporic identity -- understood as an excluded, marginalized subtext of identity in the new world. But why is Africa being involed here? What does \"Africa\" mean in this new world context? What is the larger global context of these assumptions about \"Africa\" and what is its history? Does the term \"Africa\" itself have a history? What is \"African literature?\" This course, therefore, will also help students not only to ask fundamental questions about identity but also to understand identity as a moving and dynamic construct. How, for example, does \"Africa\" travel to South America, to the Caribbean Archipelago, and to Europe? See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.",

We will examine the history of trade, particularly the slave trade, and its cultural and political legacy. We will compare the experiences of European imperalism--how the scramble for Africa dovetailed with the last decades of the Ottoman Empire--with an eye to how this shaped nationalist movements in both regions. The course will also explore the decades of independence with a special eye towards pan-Africanism and pan-Arabism. We will also study the ramifications of the Arab-Israeli conflict on the relationship between African and Middle-Eastern countries, from Uganda to Ethiopia, from OPEC to Darfur. The course will pay close attention to migrations through the regions, whether forced or economic or religious. Whenever possible we will explore, through film and literature, how people in Africa and the Middle East see their connections, and their differences.",

Rooted in the rubric of public intere social science, the course focuses on: 1) merging problem solving with theor and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice, racial harmony, equality, and human rights; and 2)engaging in publi debate on human issues to make the research results accessible to a broad audience. The workshop brings in guest speakers and will incorporate origin ethnographic research to merge theory with action. Students are encouraged apply the framing model to a public interest research and action topic of their choice. This is an academically-based-community-service (ABCS) course that partners directly with Penn's Netter Center Community Partnerships.",

We will also raise some questions about the interrelationship of religion and culture as well as religion and social change in Africa, and the challenges of modern technologies to African beliefs. We will examine the future of African religions and analyze the extent to which African peoples can hold on to their beliefs in this age of rapid technological and scientific development. Emphasis will be on themes rather than on individual national or tribal religions. Case studies, however, will be limited to West Africa among the Akan of Ghana, the Yoruba of Nigeria, and the Mende of Sierra Leone. Questions are provided (a) to guide and direct reading (b) to form the basis for discussions (c) as exercises and (d) for examinations.",

While we do not typically think about the European colonial period in Africa in terms of 'foreign aid,' that era introduced ideas and institutions which formed the foundations for modern aid policies and practices. So we start there and move forward into more contemporary times. In addition to examining the objectives behind foreign assistance and the intentions of donors and recipients, we will look at some of the consequences (intended or unintended) of various forms of foreign aid to Africa over the past century. While not designed to be a comprehensive history of development theory, of African economics, or of international aid organizations, the course will touch on all of these topics. Previous course work on Africa is strongly advised.",

African emigres' relations with both their home and host societies will be explored and compared with the experience of other immigrant groups over the past century. Topics include reasons for leaving Africa, patterns of economic and educational adaptation abroad, changes in gender and generational roles, issues of cultural and political identity, and the impact of national immigration policies.",

But what doesthis ideological and political shift mean for a country's youth? In this coursewe will use anthropological texts to explore the ways in which young Africans are both socialized into and also play an active role in negotiating the terms of democracy. In doing so, we will look both at the great diversity in democratic ideals across the continent as well as the perceived failures of many African nations to transition to constitutional democracies. We will use a variety of examples from recent history to examine these issues, such as the recent youth uprising in Egypt and its use of social media as a tool of democracy, the role of youth in apartheid-era political protest in South Africa, and the complex intersection of indigenous politics and democratic legislation in Tanzania. This course will engage key debates in current anthropological analysis, asking about both young people's capacity for agency as well as the formation of political subjectivity.",

    "course_description" : "This graduate seminar explores the literature of African history while trying to find ways to understand history which happens on unfamiliar social and cultural terrain. The terrain is unfamiliar because the words professional historians use, and the underlying assumptions about social process, show the marks of many generations of writing about Europe. The standard histories, then, are torn between describing events in terms of European social process, in which case they do violence to the history, or finding a historical language which is closer to being locally grounded but unfamiliar to a western audience. In this course we study a number of core issues of social process. Each one is meant to direct attention to a complex of local social forms, and each is at the heart of a major body of writings of African history. A tentative list of topics includes the following: Oral tradition; knowledge and identity; ecology and ethnicity; forms of local authority and state power; ritual, conquest, and the transformation of political authority; political economy; gender and personal dependency; the ecological history of disease; popular associations and the state; the local bases of nationalism.",

But it is possible that South Africa's liberation will only entrench South Africa's hegemony in the region and thus fail to reverse or redress the economic and military imbalances created over the last 350 years. This course examines Southern Africa as a regional political subsystem within the context of African and international political economy. After reviewing the history of the region, we undertake a close study of the Southern African Development Community (SADCC) as an institutional expression of that subsystem, along with its lessons for regional integration in Africa and beyond.",

They are given guidelines for writing about live perfformances; students discuss program choices; and spend some time talking about travel to South Africa dn the lived experience of two weeks at the National Arts Festival. Everyone travels to the National Arts Festival in late June and spends two weeks attending live performances(4-6 per day), blogging on the performances, and discussing these experiences with the Professor & fellow students. We visit a game park and do a \"township tour: as part of the two weeks in the Eastern Cape. On returning home, students have about 4 weeks to write a substantial paper on the festival experience. While this is primarily a music class, the National Arts Fistival includes all kinds of performance--theater, music, dance, and visual arts. This is two weeks of total immersion in the arts, and thinking deeply about the place of the arts in contemporary life and society.",

The class will culminate in research projects that students individually design and pursue. Some prior familiarity with Middle Eastern or North African studies is useful.",

Two of Sudan's neighbors have Arabic as their official language (Egypt & Libya). While in neighboring Chad and Eritrea, Arabic is widely spoken. The only barrier that divides Sudan from Arabia is the Red Sea. Arabic is the official language of the Sudan, and Sudanese pidgin Arabic (Juba Arabic) is widely used in the southern part of the country. Sudanese colloquial Arabic has close resemblance to Egyptian Colloquial Arabic and to Classical Arabic. Sudanese colloquial Arabic is also spoken and is intelligible in Eritrea, Chad, Nigeria and many places in West Africa. This course will focus on speaking, listening, reading, & writing Sudanese Arabic through the followings: 1- Speaking: Conversing in Sudanese Arabic in various settings. 2- Reading & Writing: Reading and writing of Sudanese Arabic Texts. 3- Listening: Listening to various audio recordings of Sudanese Arabic in different forms and settings.",

The current conflict in Darfur is one of many wars that ravaged Sudan prior to the ending of Africa's longest civil war between the government forces and military insurgency in the southern part of the country. This course aims to study the reasons behind these military conflicts, civil wars and ethnic conflicts that characterize the modern history of Sudan. There are many reasons behind these conflicts with variation from conflicts over identity to issues of unequal development and representation, to the hegemony of ethnic politics depicted as nationalistic. The course intends to provide students with political and cultural history of the Sudan along with in depth analysis of the many factors that are shaping today's Sudan.",

The focus will be on the languages and linguistics of Africa to provide you with the knowledge and skills required to handle the language and language-related issues typical of African conditions. We will cover topics related to formal linguistics (phonology/phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics), aspects of pragmatics as well as the general socio-linguistic character of African countries. We will also cover language in context, language and culture, borrowing, multilingualism, and cross-cultural communication in Africa.",

Around each of the major ethnic groups are located the minorities in a centre-periphery fashion. The ethnic minorities lack numerical clout to gain democratic control of national decision-making apparatus. They are therefore agitated for home rule resulting in the creation of new states in the federation. But the relative powerlessness remained. The troubling paradox of the situation is that oil wells which account for 95% of Nigeria's export earnings are located in areas that lack decision-making power. The result is a combination of resources without power or control. The minorities feel exploited, protest the seeming colonialism, and demand resource control.",

In contrast, Sunjata Epic of Mali, Mwindo Epic of Congo and more than twenty-five other heroic narrative poems throughout Africa are less known but equally valuable for accessing ancient wisdom, exploits of heroes and heroines, cultural values, knowledge systems, and supernatural realms. An additional benefit of studying African epic is that they are performed today or in living memory, so the cultural, performative, and social contexts are not obscured by centuries. These living traditions give us opportunities to more fully understand bards' roles, interaction of bard and audience, transformation from oral to written representation, and the extension of epic themes into other aspects of social life.",

The course will also investigate the politics of apartheid, the history of the ANC and other resistance movements, the experiences of political prisoners, the transition to democracy, and, in order to assess Mandela's legacy, the state of the \"new\" South Africa, now 20 years old. Each week's seminar will be topic-driven, to include recent scholarly debates around Mandela and tradition, Mandela and the modern colonial city, Mandela and law, Mandela and the armed struggle, Mandela and prison, Mandela and nation building, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the politics of gender, family, and sexuality (including the AIDS epidemic). This course will be of interest not only to students with an interest in Mandela as a great man, but in the nature of colonial oppression, liberation struggles, human rights, and genres of historical representation (autobiography, biography, documentaries and biopics, for instance) and contemporary cultures of celebrity.",

This state of affairs is hardly historically unique - complex interconnections have existed for centuries. Yet this course looks behind the numbers to consider whether the current moment is qualitatively different from earlier iterations of globalization. How do we understand a road built by Chinese laborers in Nigeria, a \"Chinese\" airport in Sudan, a copper minemine in Zambia, a gold mine in Peru, oil investments in Venezuela and Ecuador, or massively increasing trade with Brazil? Together we will explore Chinese state and firm-level interventions in Africa and Latin America as harbingers of an emergent global economic structure, largely defined by intensified and re-configured South-South linkages. Through the disciplinary methods of anthropology, political economy, management, and media studies we will consider both the historical context of intensified Chinese involement in these regions and a wide rnage of more contemporary ethnographies and case studies. In the process, we will subject transnational economic studies, the statements of managers and officials, and popular culture texts alike to fine-grained readings",

It is curious then that these same pieces are those that have also been relegated to glass cases in private collections and museums to be contemplated as \"art for art's sake.\" The ideologies reflected by this transformation from ritual object to art is one topic we examine as we look at African art and the West from the Renaissance to the present. Other topics include the importance of African art to the early modernist movement, the role of cultural tourism in preserving African indigenous art, and the trans-national commentary of contemporary African artists. This course also concerns the misappropriation of African cultural artifacts and ways in which standard museum practices decontextualize these artifacts, distort their meaning, and perpetuate colonial hierarchies. For the term project students will explore benefits and limitations of cyber museology, working collaboratively to create a web exhibit to complement the Africa collection at the Penn museum.",

    "course_description" : "This graduate student course takes a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of African Political Economy. While the course is grounded in the discipline of history, it seeks to prepare students to actively engage with the social sciences, in particular economics, political science, and anthropology. The study of Africa's economic past has moved through many different waves, after an initial burst of scholarship, during the 1860's and 1970's, which dealt with questions such as how Africa was integrated into the world economy, and the causes of wealth and prosperity, the field began to grapple with questions of governance in the 1990s. These questions took two forms. The first approach from political science argued that an analysis of the behavior of political institutions held the key to understanding Africa's economic performance, and the second aproach coming out of anthropology questioned the legitimacy of the development of disocurse itself. Within the last ten years economists have returned to the study of Africa's past, borrowing a focus on African states' institutions to tackle long running questions such as why Africa is poorer than other regions of the world.",

The site from which mankind first arose, South Africa has a long and varied history. This introductory course will trace this history in broad strokes, from pre-colonial times to the near present, focusing most attention on the period from the mineral discoveries of the late 19th century until now. Main themes will include colonial conquest and indigenous resistance, the creation of new racial and national identities, and the rise, life and demise of the aparthied state. Examining large historical processes, (often through the lens of individual lives) by way of novels, films and scholarly readings will enable a broader engagement with issues of race and racism as well as gender and generational conflicts. Course requirements will include exams and a short writing assignment.",
