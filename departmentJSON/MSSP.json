The first portion of the semester concentrates on defining research problems, research design (including sampling, measurement, and causal inference), and assessing research quality. The latter portion of the semester focuses upon data analysis including descriptive statistics, measures of association for categorical and continuous variables, introduction to t-tests, ANOVA and regression, and the language of data analysis. Students will learn how to choose and apply statistical tools to data sources, how to interpret quantitative studies, and will gain experience using SPSS - a statistical software package..",

This will also include methods of incomplete case analysis (i.e. missing data analysis . Then various aspects of regression analysis with multiple independent variables will be covered including categorical explanatory variables (e.g. to estimate group differences), interaction effects, mediating effects (e.g. to estimate the indirect effect of social processes), and non-linear effects. The course will then cover some of the applications of the general(ized) linear model including logistic regression, some elements of path modeling (structural equation modeling), multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modeling), and longitudinal modeling (growth modeling). The course will be taught using SAS, but students are welcome to use any statistical package of comfort. Pre-requisite: Introductory Graduate Statistics.",

    "course_description" : "This course is concerned with interrogating the dualism of schools and society that has been an on-going discourse in philosophy, research, and policy. In education policy, in particular, the question of the educative experiences that go on beyond schooling have been slow to be taken up and often relegated to public and social policy. And due to the siloes of policymaking and implementation there has been very little dialogue or collaborative design between education and social policy, leaving major gaps in the experience and process of education and human development. This course will begin by looking at how educational philosophy and theory has taken up this dualism beginning with Nietzche, Dewey, Durkheim, and Marx, through Ivan Illich, Larry Cremin, Jean Lave, Edmund Gordon, and Herve Varenne. Then, we will survey various social and educational research that examine the various spaces outside of schooling that matter for human learning and development including the Coleman Report, and work on poverty, education, and human development. The third part of the course will explore both actual and proposed policy models to address a much broader understanding of education such as Head Start, the Harlem Children's Zone, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, The Broader Bolder Approach, and other supplementary and comprehensive educational services and",

To develop these and related skills, this course utilizes as a base a dynamic social problem analysis framework that addresses issues of equity, equality and adequacy. It also examines multiple theoretical and analytical perspectives. Through the review of contemporary and historical social policy debates and provisions, selected case examples and policy briefs, this course provides students with an understanding of the policy roles of the legislative and executive branches of government, including goal setting, policy rulemaking and enactment, allocation of resources, financing, regulation, and implementation. The policy process at state and local levels of government will also be addressed. The primary focus is on U.S. policy although global policies will be discussed when relevant.",

By leaning on postmodern thinkers such as Iris Marion Young, Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Ernesto Laclau, and Michel Foucault, this seminar course will begin by engaging the questions of what is \"difference\" and how is \"difference\" discursively constructed and reproduced in society. Using a postmodern lens, the remainder of the course will engage various social science texts that deal with the varieites of \"difference\" (i.e. race, gender, class, sexuality) and the explicit and/or implicit policy implications of these works. Thus, we will critically engage policies such as welfare, affirmative action, economic policies of taxation, and same-gender marriage, among others. The underlying questions throughout the course will be to what extend does social policy enable the possibilities of freedom, justice, and democracy for the \"Other\", the deviant, the abject, the marginalized, those of assumed \"difference\"? And, to what extent does policy constrain those possibilities at the same time?",
