The structural mechanics theories of rods, plates and shells are introduced including both linear and nonlinear theories.",

Vector Mechanics; II. Statics and Structures; and III. Kinematics and Dynamics. Topics include: vector analysis, statics of rigid bodies, introduction to deformable bodies, friction, kinematics of motion, work and energy, and dynamics of particles. Case studies will be introduced, and the role of Newtonian mechanics in emerging applications including bio- and nano- technologies will be discussed.",

The two disciplinary groups will be treated separately and receive credit for different courses (ARCH746 will be taught concurrently and in some cases co-located) as they will be learning different things. Engineering students gain design sensibilities and advanced mechatronics in the form of networked embedded processing and protocols for large scale actuation and sensing. Design students learn elementary mechatronics and design reactive architectures and work with engineering students to build them.

The process of \"crystallizing\" a clever idea into a saleable asset demands a mix of creativity, systems thinking, sound business instincts, and the courage ot do things differently. Students in this project-centered course will gain the necessary skills and experience from concentrated work on early-stage inventions drawn from Penn's technology portfolio. Is the invention feasible? Patentable? How should it be designed and produced? What will it cost? Is there a market? Does the payoff justify the investment? These and similar questions will be answered through a multifaceted process including analysis, experimentation, design, and/or market research. The projects are not \"case studies,\" but rather involve real, current intellectual property of potential value to the University. Project work will be complemented by lectures and exercises dealing with the patent process, cost and market estimation, project planning, economic analysis, and the systems approach to new product design.
