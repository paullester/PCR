The majority of work is from direct observation including object study, still life, landscape, interior and exterior space and the self portrait. Class problems advance sequentially with attention paid to perceptual clarity, the selection and development of imagery, the process of synthesis and translation, color, structure and composition, content and personal expression. Students will become familiar with contemporary and art historical precedent in order to familiarize them with the history of visual ideas and find appropriate solutions to their painting problems.",

Photography picked up on the tradition in 1827 and has not only made use of the form, but has expanded the topic into very unique territories. Contemporary artists have re-invented and re-invigorated the still life, formalism & abstract photography. As a framework for exploring 'hands-on' lighting techniques, students will creatively grapple with the photography of objects in the studio. Working with the physical, symbolic, and conceptual ramifications of depicting specific forms in an image, teamed with the discussion of key texts, critiques, and studio lighting seminars, each student will create a considered and unique portfolio of images.",

Students will be introduced to the key issues surrounding photography now- led through these questions by lectures, readings, group discussion and project-based work. A series of photo-assignments challenge the students to integrate critical thought with practice, exploring a range of formal strategies and thematic frameworks that affect the meaning of their images. Students should have a strong interest in philosophy and art histories (especially the history of photography.) They should be motivated to work independently & experiment creatively. There are no prerequisites for this course. It is intended for all different levels of technical experience, but the minimum requirements are a digital camera, a basic familiarity with Photoshop and access to a computer with imaging software.",

The origin of the still life can be found in images as far back as antiquity and has dealt with notions of death, science, class, social customs and even sex. Photography picked up on the tradition in 1827 and has not only made use of the form, but has expanded the topic into very unique territories. Contemporary artists have re-invented and re-invigorated the still life, formalism & abstract photography. As a framework for exploring 'hands-on' lighting techniques, students will creatively grapple with the photography of objects in the studio. Working with the physical, symbolic, and conceptual ramifications of depicting specific forms in an image, teamed with the discussion of key texts, critiques, and studio lighting seminars, each student will create a considered and unique portfolio of images.",

The ancient role of the artist is to hold witness, each in her and his way, to nature's meaning. Each student will be required to take notes of the impressions and imaginations and these should be recorded in both written and pictorial form. An effort to pursue originality is key.

Throughout the semester, students will advance by learning lighting techniques and strategies of presentation - as these core skills will become tools in the execution of project concepts.

Exploring both traditional and contemporary methods of portraiture, this class will uncover and discuss the ways in which we perceive each other in imagery, both as individuals and as groups. Throughout the semester, we will consider how portraits deal with truth, physical absence, the gaze, cultural embodiment, voyeurism and the digital persona. This course will build on the combination of perception, technology, and practice. Throughout the semester, students will advance by learning lighting techniques and strategies of presentation - as these core skills will become tools in the execution of project concepts. In tandem with each project, students will encounter and discuss a wide array of photography and writings from the past to the present, in an effort to understand the meanings and psychological effects of freezing the human image in time",

This lecture course, through an historical and pedagogical romp loaded with examples throughout film history and visits by lauded audio professionals from the film world, seeks to instruct students to engage in the process of sound perception, gaining an appreciation for the art of sound as it relates to the varied phenomenological dimensions of that unique audio-visual encounter we call movies.",

Contemporary art has become an increasingly important marker of a city (and nation's) economic development. According to economist and social scientist Richard Florida, contemporary art activity is an expression of a city's Creative Class, the generators of cultural and economic innovation. But what exactly is this world of contemporary art? The course begins by distinguishing between modern and contemporary art. There will be a teasing out of the issues from modern art that remain unresolved for contemporary art. Students will study the key pre-occupations that are spurring much contemporary art production, including issues relating to identity in the age of globalization. A question that will be studied in this course relates to theways in which artists have responded to dominant narratives of globalization. Additionally, another important question would look into how the artist's role has changed in the new globalized context of art production and circulation (including the rise of the art biennale.) By taking this course, students gain understanding into the constitution and of the contemporary art world and the key issues at play within it. There will be several trips to exhibitions to be announced.",

We will focus on primary sources in order to situate our inquiry in a larger historical context. The discussion will center on claims about the inherent meaning of forms, discuss different roles for designas an ideological statement, as an agent of societal change, and as an idiosyncratic expression. Topics will also include the search for a universal visual language, attempts at bridging the perceived gap between spoken and written language, and the impact of visual form on the meaning of literary texts (particularly when the author has been involved).

Film Sound tracks the technological and aesthetic history of sound for film including psychoacoustics, dialogue, music, sound fx and audio's gradual and triumphant march towards fidelity, stereo and surround sound. This lecture course, through an historical and pedagogical romp loaded with examples throughout film history and visits by lauded audio professionals from the film world, seeks to instruct students to engage in the process of sound perception, gaining an appreciation for the art of sound as it relates to the varied phenomenological dimensions of that unique audio-visual encounter we call movies.",
