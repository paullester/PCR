In this course we will examine how Russians themselves communicate about and represent Russia and what this reveals about this complex society and its development. We will consider print journalism, novels, films, televised media, and the internet-paying close attention both to particular representations and to social institutions for their production, dissemination and consumption. Topics of special concern will include: conspiracy theories, representations of Russian history, culture or society is required. All readings and screenings will be in English.",

This course will instead apply the question that Goffman posed in Frame Analysis: \"what is it that is going on here?\" Assumptions The resultant reactions will form the basis for each week's discussion, followed by a lecture on the readings. The first four sessions re-examine historical definitions of documentary and the material bases of documentary filmmaking. Subsequent sessions will read Goffman's Frame Analysis alongside specific discussions of the screened films. Definitions of documentary will developed within an enhanced understanding the conditions of production and reception of specific documentaries. Production, following Goffman, will be seen as a set of specific social social encounters. Reception will be understood through self and group examination as well as through an examination of the concept of 'witness'.",

What is media advocacy? What does it look like? What are the strategies and tactics employed by media activists? How do media insiders effectively contend with media outsiders lobbying for change?

Social issues related to these issues are many; they include privacy, surveillance, industrial constructions of audiences, varieties of redlining , understandings of food and food-culture, and definitions of identity and public-private space. Marketers say that out-of-home advertising is the fastest growing-form of advertising next to internet advertising. During the past couple of years, every major media conglomerate has joined the race to track and reach people as they move through the world. Oddly, communication researchers have virtually ignored this part of our world. So I think there is here an opportunity here to push a new research agenda.",

Toward this end, by the end of the semester students will be expected to be sufficiently familiar with the field to propose original studies on topics of their choosing.

Such claims consciously echoed those made in the 1930s by Walter Benjamin for the political force of the caption. Yet, historically, it was exceptional for a photographic image to be encountered free from the overdeterminations of writing. From Talbot's Pencil of Nature to the illustrated press of the 1890s, from the archiving systems of the late nineteenth century to the picture magazines of the 1930s, the photograph never occupied a pristine space. What does this tell us about radical theory in the 1930s and 1970s? More broadly, what does it entail for our view of photographic meaning, the notion of the purely visual image and attempts to define the history of photography as the history of a distinct medium? This seminar will come at these questions backwards, moving from postconceptual practices back to those hybrid technological products that prompted exaggerated expectations but also exacerbated deep uncertainties about the status of the photograph that haunt us still, all the more in the age of the photograph's digital dissemination.",

Second, this course critically examines the structures of the communication systems themselves, including ownership, profit imperatives, support mechanisms such as advertising and public relations,and the ideologies and government policies that sustain these arrangements. Considering case studies ranging from traditional news and entertainment media to new digital and social media, the course provides a comprehensive survey of the major texts in this vibrant sub-field of media studies.",

We draw on film theory, psychoanalysis, literary analysis, cognitive theory, communication studies, and visual anthropology to discuss several key issues related to the state of film/filmmaking in an age of \"digital\" media. We interrogate contentious notions of authority, reflexivity, and objectivity. We analyze film's claim to \"realistic\" (iconic and indexical) representation. We interrogate how \"film\" and \"video\" get imagined in all their visual particularity, sometimes conflated into a single visual form and at other moments distinguished as a function of the difference between photochemical and electro-magnetic processes. We also highlight the kinds of techniques filmmakers use to thematize these same issues \"on screen.\" Students will be responsible for watching one film each week (along with the the course readings), and part of the final project involves helping to produce a group documentary/ethnographic \"film\" that engages the course's central concerns.",

Collective memory has emerged as one of the most widespread, yet least understood, manifestations of contemporary culture. This course uses the study of collective memory to better explain the charting of disciplinary knowledge about journalism. Students will consider major theories and histories of collective memory and explore the ways in which they have taken shape as disciplinary approaches to journalism's study. Considering disciplines as communities of memory, whose participants gravitate toward codified ways of approaching problems, issues and events, the course uses the idea of shared memory as a way to explain and evaluate how the academy develops and legitimates knowledge, how the past is strategically used to drive engagements with the present, and how simplified notions from the past stand in for complicated phenomena of the present. The course aims to develop student familiarity with the vagaries of collective memory, the workings of the academy, and the frames for understanding the study of journalism, all with an eye to improving students' skills as cultural critics on a variety of topics.",

It serves as an introduction to the emerging epistemology of communication, which is concerned less with what communication is than with what it does, constitutes, and actively maintains, including when being studied. The seminar develops analytical tools to understand how realities establish themselves in language and action, how individuals can become entrapped in their own reality constructions, how facts are created and institutions take advantage of denying their constructedness. After reading several exemplary studies, students explore the nature of a construction on their own. The seminar draws on the discourse of critical scholarship and emancipatory pursuits, which are allied with feminist writing, cultural studies, and reflexive sociology. It is committed to dialogical means of inquiry and takes conversation as an ethical premise.",

Based on a variety of scholarly and trade readings about the globalization of media and culture, the changing media and creative industries, and the music video genre itself, questions to be tackled include: What changes when a media form migrates from its original context? What does the content of music videos reveal about socio-economic and cultural change worldwide? How do music videos rearticulate gender and sexuality, and nationalism? What transnational circuits of ideas, images and ideologies are enabled or constrained by music video?",

It has been used by media scholars first as a way of understanding the ensemble of technologies that captured previously public practices: just as television brought theater and motion pictures from public spaces into the home, so the automobile brought the streetcar into the garage, the telephone brought the streetcorner into the hallway, and the refrigerator brought the market into the kitchen. More recently, media scholars have used it to discuss new mobile communication communication technologies, most notably the walkman and the mobile phone. The proposed seminar will situate this familiar scholarship within a longer history of mobile privatization in western capitalist modernity. It will include scholarship on the history of apparatuses of mobility like legal and financial regimes, record-keeping and surveillance practices, and print media. Topics will include paper money, postal systems, photography, passports, and newspapers and other ephemera. In the background of such treatments are two larger concerns that will be introduced early and inform class discussions. The first involves the relationships among privacy, the public, community, and democracy.The second involves the relationship between mobility-as-freedom and control, particularly in the form of surveillance.",

Part II takes on the voluminous privacy jurisprudence spawned by the Bill of Rights -- most importantly, the First and Fourth Amendments' jurisprudence of associational, physical, and informational privacy. What are the values at stake in constitutional privacy controversies; are they the same values at issue in the common law and in discussions of social networking, web-based commerce, cloud computing and government surveillance? Part III explores the federal privacy statutes, a dynamic source of privacy and data protection law. It surveys nearly a dozen federal privacy statutes, covering government record management; health, education, and financial data; video rentals; communications; the internet; and government surveillance.

We will look at rituals that focus on individual transitions -- the quinceanera for example -- as well as those that mark transitions on a far larger scale such as presidential elections. We will explore rituals that unfold at the local level and are experienced \"up close\" as well as those that most Americans experience only via the media.",

How do societies organize the project of communication with seemingly disembodied (and sometimes quite decidedly non-human) subjects? How have advances in media technologies (for instance, photography, telegraphy, film) served as mechanisms for re-imagining potential links between human speakers and otherworldly interlocutors? The class also tries to examine some of what the story of 19th century spiritualism and early 20th century mass media technology might tell us about the field of Communication Studies and its points of convergence with (and divergence from) the discipline of Anthropology.

Students should expect to work on their projects outside class time. The school will provide basic filmmaking equipment- video cameras and computers for editing in labs. Students are responsible for all storage (computer drives), tapes, dvds, and project relatedcosts.",

The course will begin with an analysis of how economic forces have influenced local news coverage over the last century, focusing on the importance of geography and political fragmentation. We will look at how suburbanization and the rise of local TV newscasts affected metropolitan newspapers in the 20th century, and then considered \"local news.\" We will then zero in on the structural transformation that has accelerated in the last year--exacerbated by the economic downturn--which now threatens the existence of many metropolitan newspapers. We will examine new models for producing local news, including freestanding local news websites, \"hyperlocalism,\" citizen-generated content and blogging, and free dailies targeted to young people. At the same time, the course will examine how local news affects local government. We will examine the changing professional values and \"standard operating procedures\" of local journalists in the face of new competition and new online news products. We will also consider how local news is influenced by the media strategies (or lack thereof) of local public officials, and the extent to which they are able to understand the economic forces and professional constraints of the reporters who cover them.",

These struggles take place across a spectrum of sites in Washington, from the halls and hearing rooms of Congress, to regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission to the plush offices of K Street lobbying firms. Through a series of case studies and guest speakers, we will examine a variety of policy and programming issues,as well as political, economic, and social forces, that are having a major impact on the media landscape. Topics to be covered will include: minority and female media ownership, public interest content and news programming, broadband access, interactive advertising, public media, newspaper ownership, and digital music distribution.",

But it is also critical to urbanization, globalization, modernity, mobility, social hierarchy, flow, scale, imperialism (what Said called the geography of violence), revolution, intimacy, shopping malls, simulacra, and being-in-the-world. Space is not only mediated and dialectical; it is a privileged strategy of post-modernity, \"the everywhere of modern thought.\" So far as media go, the analytic of space implies a shift away from narrative and toward process and practice as ways of structuring experience. What are the theories that get at this? How can we use theories of space to think about media and culture, to rediscover the richness of the world? And what about the explosive iteration of screen culture that logically ought to imperil lived space but seem to offer new modes for grounding it. We will explore these themes in the relevant literatures for the purpose of developing fabulously interesting research projets, including some in visual format. No spatial pre-requisites.",

This course will allow students to study various ethnographic treatments of urban communities in the United States, using films, articles, TV serials, and books as guides for the framing of their own independent research on the streets of Philadelphia. Students will also form production teams of two or three people, and these production teams will be responsible for (i) identifying and researching an important urban issue in contemporary Philadelphia and (ii) turning that research into a 15-30 minute radio documentary that will be broadcast on a local Philadelphia radio station, WURD 900AM. Mixing radio/audio journalism with ethnographic methods, will enhance their skills at archival and social research, participant- observation, interviewing techniques, sound editing, and production. This course is intended to be a rigorous and exciting opportunity for students to tell empirically grounded stories using the voices of their subjects and the sounds of the city. Potential texts include: Sidewalk (a book and documentary film my Mitchell my Mitchell Duneier), Righteous Dopefiend (a book and museum exhibit by Philippe Bourgois), and excerpts from other ethnographic work by Ana Ramos-Zayas, Elijah Anderson, Todd Wolfson, David Grazian, Setha Low, Ulf Hannerz, Leith Mullings, John Gwaltney, Dana-ain Davis, Carol Stack, Melissa Checker, Katherine S.

This course is an examination of current dilemmas in historical context; about strategic communications in contrast or challenge to goals of free expression and to the exercise of power over the flow of information. Taking relevant contexts, including societies in transition, authoritarian societies, states and societies in conflict, we explore the relationship of the state and other entities to the flow of words and images, and how these messages impact public opinion, stability, and democratic growth. We start with a theoretical orientation focused on two competing paradigms- the paradigm of free expression and the paradigm of national identity, conflict management, and sovereignty. The class will then explore several case studies viewed through the lens of narrative theory. Areas of discussion may include case studies such as Ukraine, Russia, Syria, Iran and, as well, the drama of the development of global internet policy.",

This course is designed to give you a firm grasp of the historical trajectory of global communication theory and to develop knowledge of the central debates that have animated the field since the mid-20th century. We will discuss how these debates have changed, under what circumstances, and how contemporary scholarship wrestles with them; and how language and jargon in the field has shifted from \"international\" to \"global.\" We will also explore why some key issues and media have received relatively scant attention in global communication research, while others have arguably been over-emphasized. We will read a mixture of primary sources by luminaries in the different paradigms that have dominated global communication, complemented with secondary texts that are carefully selected to give you a sense of the architecture of the field, an understanding of what sub-areas of global communication scholarship are published and the journals and presses that publish in those sub-areas.",

Individual weeks focus on such topics as the conflict that arises when a journalist's obligation to a confidential source clashes with a duty to the judicial system, whether the business of journalism is business, how journalism and NGO work compares as public service, and whether journalism by committed political activists (such as public service, and whether journalism by committed political activists (such as I.F.

We will sort through a rich literature, mostly outside communication studies, that locates a \"performing\" self in the midst of all the billboards and department stores. Taken as a whole, the literature points to a new modal self concerned with the conscious staging of an attractive personality, bound up in the rise of advertising and the consumer economy. The authors under discussion--including Thorstein Veblen, Philip Rieff, Warren Susman, David Riesman, Erving Goffman, Daniel Bell, Raymond Williams, Jackson Lears, Roland Marchand and Axel Honneth--differ in crucial respects on the nature of this new self, its sources and its consequences. Our task will be to make sense of the competing claims, but also to identify points of overlap. A major theme early in the semester will be the experience of dislocation, anonymity and sped-up living that accompanied major social change in the decades around the turn of the century. We will focus on the personal and social adaptations to this experience, reflected in but also driven by advertising-driven consumption.

This shift from government to governance involves an increased emphasis on self- and co-regulation as well as on regional and global regulation.

The course first addresses interconnections between the move towards governance, the crisis of journalism and political communication. Second, the shift from government to governance is scrutinized, discussing privatizing, democratizing, Europeanizing and globalizing media governance. Third, the course discusses options for traditional statutory regulation to respond to the media crisis. The final part focuses on researching media governance, discussing both methods for analyzing media systems and the role of research in media policy-making.",

Traditional critical and cultural studies tend to focus on how entertainment, aesthetic experience, ideology, meaning, pleasure, hegemony, identity, etc. are produced or formed by film/TV's onscreen products (films, series, video games). But this course turns the table and will investigate the ways that those same societal downstream \"effects\" can also be seen as generative forces that cultivate certain approaches to production over others; and certain kinds of organization and behavior at studios and production companies rather than others.",

The seminar will draw on the work of the Center for Global Communication Studies using case studies from Europe, China, India, the US and elsewhere. The following issues will likely be included: understanding of institutions of censorship in Iran; competing concepts of \"internet freedom\" ; the roles of the UN rapporteur on free expression and equivalents at the OSCE, the OAS and in Africa; concepts of pluralism; varying definitions and judicial examinations of \"decency\"; political control and the making of policy concerning satellite transponders; approaches to media independence and ownership; and changing concepts of public service media. The course starts from the premise that the policies that govern the media are significant societal artifacts embedding distinct values, patterns and processes of control in relation to mediation, freedom of expression and access to information. They are the result of forces-institutional, technical and cultural-acting toward a particular notion of social order. Media laws and policies are signposts concerning commitments to democratic aspirations, to ideas of identity and to symbols of a society's cohesion. Media laws and policies are, as well, an essay on globalization over time.",

Aided by a wide, eclectic and provocative literature, we will pay special attention to two characteristics of the digital media ecology: (1) the crumbling of boundaries between nations, cultures, technologies, and media; and (2) the often contentious circulation of discourse enabled by the weakening of borders, especially in revolutionary times. We will also explore (3) issues of aesthetics and affect in old-new media couplings. The Arab uprisings will operate as a principal locus for discussion and analysis, but like everything I teach this seminar will be global in scope and comparative in outlook.

Another goal is to understand the causes and dynamics of media control and media innovation, the formation of publics and counterpublics, and the role of media and political change. We will examine how the state and the market shape media practices in different media genres and how media professionals, artists, citizens, and audience negotiate change.

Turkey, as a country of migratory waves from its birth, is a pristine example of such a process and unique for its elites' interventions into the cultural sphere. The course introduces students contesting theories, and presents the differences between demographically stabilized societies societies and theories of elite cultures and class. In the final stage, a significant attention is given about how the founders of modern Turkey tried to create a high culture by \"populist\" policies, and how people's culture turned instead into \"popular\" within migration toward the urban centers. The course is broadly concerned with three dynamics of Turkish society - demographic transition, elitist cultural policies, and partly oppositional character of popular culture.

The nascent commercial gay porn film industry developed in tension with the emergent gay liberation politics; new films were advertised in the gay press that critically examined the political and social value of this form of homosexual representation. This course will use the comparative case study of the reception of two films - Broadway choreography-turned-pornographer Wakefield Poole's Boys in the Sand (1971) and sex club owner and porn star Fred Hastead's L.A. Plays Itself (1972)- against the socio-political geography of New York and Los Angeles. Students will develop skills in: 1) the critical analysis of non-mainstream film and 2) the use of the alternative press as an historical archive. The discussion will be informed by concepts related to: sex and the built environment; the role of public space in development of sexual community; and the role of alternative media in the production of imagined community. The last weeks of the course will consider how current web-based pornography continues or alters aspects of the tradition of renegade sexual imaginaries and spaces.",

This course will introduce and discuss recent contributions to the debate of how digital data - and the larger, more granular sets of observations of what we do as we use online technologies - change social research and the questions we can ask about the social world we inhabit. Although the use of big data raises many relevant privacy concerns, this course will show that there is value in stirring the discussion away from normative claims and consider, instead, how big data is helping us push social research to new, exciting frontiers.",

How can social technologies help to promote the emergence of social movements and new democratic politics? This course examines theories of social change and innovation diffusion, in light of methodological advances in network science and computational social science. The new revolution in computing has creating remarkable opportunities for doing social science research, and understanding the dynamics of how collective behaviors emerge and spread. The goal of the course is to think carefully about how formal/predictive modelscan be connected with empirical data. This course addresses research at the forefront of social science and complex systems. Participants will get the most out of the material by aggressively pursuing questions that emerge from the readings, and from participating in hands-on research projects. The expectation is that students will develop research projects, or mature existingprojects, which will be the focus of their work for the course. They should use this course as a foundation for developing publishable research. This course will also focus on the presentation of research - emphasizing clear, intelligible presentations, suitable for disciplinary conferences.",

Networks are behind those (and, by extension, most) dimensions of social life. They offer the language to capture the invisible structure of interdependence that links us together, and the means to analyze dynamics like diffusion, influence, or the effects of media in an increasingly diverse information environment. The aim of this course is to introduce networks and the relational way of thinking. Students will gain the necessary literacy to read, interpret, and design network-based research; learn how to go from concepts to metrics; and draw and interpret networks through the lens of substantive research questions. We will pay equal attention to the theory and the empirics of network science, and set the foundations for more advanced workon networks.",

Revolutionary contexts are considered as battlegrounds where multiple narratives contend for visibility. We will explore relevant debates and polemics, historical and contemporary, concerning the political impact of technology and the role of gender and sexuality in revolutionary politics. We will focus on social media, political humor, graffiti, and the human body as instruments of communication. The overall approach of the seminar is theoretical, critical and transnational.",

Regardless of the specific technology (blogs, micro-blogs, social networking sites, peer-to-peer networks), social media make interdependence more prevalent, and exposure to information more pervasive. But social networks, and the ties that bring us together, have long mediated the way in which we obtain information, engage in public discussion, and are recruited or mobilized for a public cause. So what has social media brought to the table that is new? This course will evaluate the evidence that can help us answer this question, as well as challenge conventional views and discuss questions that remain open.

    "course_description" : "Online networks are prevalent in how we access and share information. They shape how we consume news, how we interact with friends, peers and strangers, and how we mobilize groups or try to gain the attention of large audiences. Online networks encourage dynamics of information exchange that can, potentially, be very consequential for the societies we live in or the societies we would like to build. Networked technologies have, in brief, the potential to transform governance, collaboration, and organization, and radically change how we think about regulation and policy making in the digital age. This research seminar aims to help students develop a technical understanding of how networks operate, what dynamics they are more likely to encourage, and what features limit their ability to diffuse information or spread behavior. We need to understand the logic of networks - and learn how to model their complex and counter-intuitive dynamics -before we can analyze their social impact or engineer interventions, for instance, campaigns to promote socially beneficial behavior.",

It focuses on how communication affects political behavior, attitudes, and outcomes. In doing so we question the forces that shape media institutions and how different political and social institutions shape individual-level communication effects. The course is designed to provide a greater understanding of comparative political communication theories, as well as to develop social science reasoning and methodology. Readings, class discussions, and assignments move back and forth between theories, empirical evidence, and public policies. The readings include research from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and North America though Europe receives somewhat more attention due to the richness of comparative data and research for that region.",

In what ways do thoughts, feelings, messages, and experiences mark the body, revealing the invisible internal and making it visible to the understanding eye? Have notions of bodily communication changed over time? How were prevailing ideas about the languages of the body marked by wider philosophical, artistic, literary, scientific, and medical trends? In this course, we will explore the speaking body from the eighteenth century through the early twentieth. Starting with the doctrine of maternal impressions, we will look at the ways in which the body became marked, and how these markings were expressed and understood. We will then explore physiognomy, phrenology, hysteria, and shell shock, ending the semester with a provocative discussion of psychosomatic medicine, and the modern manifestations of phrenology and physiognomy. Drawing on a variety of material and types of evidence, we will explore literary and historical documents, as well as works of art and visual culture. The assignments will be equally wide-ranging, including response papers, a primary source analysis, presentations, internet searches, visual analyses, and diary entries. The course will culminate in a written paper which will be produces in stages with careful and detailed guidance. In preparation for these assignments, we will dive in to the depths of Van Pelt to explore its treasures, and we will meet with a resource librarian to prepare ourselves to take full advantage of the resources on offer. We will also take at least one field trip to the Mutter Museum to examine their holdings and exhibits. We will emerge from this seminar with a greater understanding of the speaking body, as well as with a variety of methodological scholarly tools for conducting interdisciplinary research. This course will be highly demanding, requiring all participants to engage fully with the material and to challenge themselves to think creatively and rigorously about the themes of the course. Students will receive a great deal of assistance and writing and research, and will also work closely with one another to share the unique skills and talents that each brings to the course material.",

The quick rise of social media has affected the balance between these spaces not just within media institutions, but also in other domains of public life. This course encourages students to investigate how major social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) affect and reshape the construction of self and communities in areas of public communication, nationally as well as globally. Private identities are increasingly shaped on public forums of social media, forcing users to adapt their communicative strategies. At the same time, the principles and mechanisms underlying the ecosystem of connective media challenge conventional media organizations (newspapers and public broadcasting) to adjust their definitions of what is public and commercial. And how do social media platforms affect the formation of groups and communities in other core fields of public life, such as grass roots activism or education? Theory used for this course will include definitions of the public sphere (Habermas) and public space (Fraser, Robbins) as well as theories of identity framing (Goffmann).",

It will look empirically at citizen journalism to test theoretical approaches and will explore contingent situations in which citizens are at the centre of what used to be governmental and/or media controlled actions.

Signaling a concern with how, what, why and for whom collectives remember this phenomenon is closely tied to issues of identities, media technologies, politics and conflict, as well as imaginaries of the future. Memory by its very nature is mediated, and collective memory is even moreso, given the centrality of communications technologies in structuring imagined communities. Examining the technologies, strategies and politics of collective memory here is to go beyond the subject and foster an understanding of the intricacies and intersections of culture, communication and critical theory.",

It examines the complex and often paradoxical relationship between politics and media, the role of journalism today, and the definition of media and related normative questions. In addition, this course focuses on the changing and critically important role of public diplomacy-the way the U.S. and other nations communicate to the world. This course is designed to provide students an overview of the above subjects and to acquaint them with key areas of related literature-sensitizing them as well to the complex interaction between politics and the press. In addition to a roughly 5000-word paper covering a relevant subject selected by students, the course will help develop important pragmatic skills in terms of verbal and short-form communications. For some classes, a number of highly accomplished special guests will be utilized to highlight individual perspectives on the topics below.",

    "course_description" : "This course explores the role of communication in classic and current theories of political and economic development. It addresses the questions: What is development? What are the major hypotheses about the relationship between communication and development? How have our hypotheses about communication and development evolved over time in response to changes in prominent development theories, policy trends, and empirical evidence? What are the effects of different and political regimes on media systems and visa versa? What actions are being being taken to enhance media development? How has the media been employed to facilitate socioeconomic development, good governance, and democratic development? To what extent are media assistance programs supported by theory and empirical evidence? What should be the focus of future development efforts? First, the course surveys the major theories over the past 50 years about how states develop economically and politically focusing on the role of media, information, and communication as both causes and consequences of development. It considers how the theories shaped public policies and investigates the real-world and academic challenges that emerged. Second, the course examines some current communication and development issues including: Media and conflict; media regulation in democratic and authoritarian regimes; restrictive media environments and public opinion; elections and the media; communication and governance; development and changing forms of political communication, including the mass media, citizen deliberation, and new information and communication technologies; information access, poverty, and inequality; development communication and persuasion; and media development interventions and outcomes. For each topic we will critically examine the working hypotheses, methods, and evidence. The class is designed to provide a greater understanding of the communication challenges faced by developing countries, as well as to develop social science reasoning and methodology. The readings, class discussions, and assignments will move back and forth between theories, public policies, and empirical evidence.",

Our discussions will treat race as both a social construct and a lived reality. Case studies will include the construction of ethnic identities through media representations, the role of media in the civil rights movement, and the racial codes of popular culture. Readings and class discussion will emphasize the changing nature of race for different racialized groups, especially African Americans as well as Latinos and whites. Our definition of media is purposefully broad, covering film, radio, newspapers, music and television.

We will examines the emergence of the field in the United States, Canada, and England, thinking critically about the differences in each country both historically and today. As we consider what counts as Communication, focusing in particular on the links between qualitative and quantitative research, we also ask what gets left outside. What fields claim a relationship to Communication, and what fields have tried to sever all ties? How are these related areas of study -- including Rhetoric, Composition, Journalism, Production, Cinema Studies, and (most recently) New Media -- linked to the field of Communication, and what are the stakes for their autonomy? To answer these questions, we will explore the role of applied material in the modern academy and the status of practical and professional Communications research relative to theoretical academic pursuits. We will try (with full expectation of failure) to answer the question: What is communication?",

It focuses on how communication affects political behavior, attitudes, and outcomes. In doing so we will question how different political and social institutions shape individual-level communication effects. We also examine the roles of mass media and interpersonal communication under different regime types and economic systems. Finally we also ask how media systems are influenced by political institutions. For each topic we will critically examine the working hypotheses, methods, and evidence. The class is designed to provide a greater understanding of comparative political communication theories, as well as to develop social science reasoning and methodology. The readings, class discussions, and assignments will move back and forth between theories, empirical evidence, and public policies. The seminar will require active student participation in class discussions. The discussions will focus on the assigned readings for the week, but students are encouraged to discuss additional works that are relevant. Students must also write an original research paper, which can hopefully become a published article. The course readings span every major region but students are free to choose a geographic focus for their research paper.",

The central question is the relationship between form and effect. We examine media forms from bulletin boards systems to blogs and Twitter, as well as forms of expression, especially rhetoric, symbolism, and style. The purpose is to explore how these formal features generate and sustain affective atmospheres and emotional energy in the new media environment. Besides theoretical explorations, the seminar requires considerable work with primary materials, such as monitoring and analyzing trending topics on Twitter. We look at both routine online interaction and moments of radical and viral communication. Of special interest are cases of online mobilization and protest, viral videos, and crisis communication. Case studies are mainly taken from China and the United States to enable cross-cultural comparisons. The main theoretical resources are drawn from the works of Georg Simmel (on social forms), Raymond Williams (on cultural forms and feeing), Dick Hebdige (on style), Jullien (on propensity in classical Chinese war strategies, rhetoric, and ), F. R Ankersmit (on aesthetic politics), and Kenneth Burke (on rhetoric and symbolism). A term paper is required.",

Like the serialized novel of the 19th century, television narratives are experienced both intimately (in the privacy of the home) and communally (as the subject of community discussion.) We will study media fandom both as a discursive practice and as an artmaking community, focusing on a variety of fan arts (fiction, visual art, multimedia art and video, crafts, theatre). We will also study the various communications mechanisms (e.g. zines, Usenet, social media) and tools (e.g. photocopiers, VCRs, digital editing software) hat fans have used to make and share culture. Lastly, we will discuss the ways in which fandom is currently being mainstreamed (and perhaps commodified) and examine some of the ways in which fans are organizing to advocate for their own interests. Students will be expected to become familiar with - and contribute to - the ongoing development of fan studies as an academic discipline and an artistic movement.",

    "course_description" : "The course discusses major changes in the media of war and terror over the last two decades. The nationwide media has traditionally rallied around the flag in support of the political establishment at the breakout of violent crises. This has been a basic axiom in regard to national broadcasting and the printed press, accepted as self-evident by the community of scholars of media and politics. Representatives of the elite were free to address the media at any time, crossing the threshold through the \"front door,\" while radicals were only able to invade the screens via the \"back-door,\" that is, through the use of violence. However, following the growing globalization of heretofore national media, advances in surveillance and diffusion technologies,commercialization of news-media, and emergence of a-symmetrical wars, significant changes occurred in the coverage of war. The most salient is the fore-grounding of \"backdoor\" actors - terrorists and enemy leaders. Other actors, once positioned as extras (ordinary people) or as the storytellers behind the scene (journalists), are now promoted to center stage. All of these new actors have gained status of the kind that in the past was exclusive to media and political elites - TV editors, generals, and political figures. The possible implications of these changes on media ethics and on public understanding of war are discussed in the course. The last part of the course will focus on the role of mediated words delivered by traditional and new actors in constructing war and peace discourses.
