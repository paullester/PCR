    "course_description" : "Effective governance relies upon consistent and ethical board leadership, yet nonprofit organizations that exemplify truly model governance are few and far between. This course introduces students to the broad framework of fiduciary, strategic and generative governance but will focus most deeply on the human dimensions of board leadership. In particular, we will examine real examples and cases of moral and ethical dilemmas faced by nonprofit boards and executive leaders, and the nuanced practice required to achieve effective board governance. This will involve a careful look at several real cases, as well as guest lectures from 3-4 different nonprofit board and CEO leaders. The invited leaders will use their own experiences to guide students through some of the most challenging ethical and managerial situations that can be encountered, with the goal of providing a practical grounding for students who expect to contribute to nonprofit leadership in their careers - either as executive staff or as board members. The course will include the review of 4-5 cases, readings, 2-3 brief student presentations, a team project and one final individual project. This course complements another half-credit course that was offered in fall 2014 (NPLD 580), Nonprofit Governing Boards. While there is some continuity between the two semesters (both build upon the Chait, Ryan, Taylor frameworks set out in Governance as Leadership), each class may be taken independently as a half-credit course. The spring class offers a deeper, more interactive probe into the elements of governance that arise in real practice, animated by dynamic nonprofit leaders sharing their experiences. Each course is targeted toward students who are interested in pursuing non-profit board or executive leadership roles, and will be coordinated with the Wharton Nonprofit Board Leadership Program (NBLP).",

Using management and strategy frameworks presented in class and applied to real world organizations, student innovators learn to design and develop social impact organizations of their own invention. Students turn their passion for changing the world into concrete plans for launching a venture. Over the course of the semester, we will cover a broad array of topics associated with social innovation and entrepreneurship, including defining the problem/opportunity, refining the mission/vision, developing market research and industry analysis, defining a financial and operating structure, assessing results and progress, and scaling an enterprise. Elements of a venture plan will be drafted through multiple short assignments and students present formally and informally several times throughout the semester receiving feedback from faculty, peers, and accomplished social entrepreneurs. Graduate students in any of Penn's graduate and professional schools who want to create social value through either nonprofit or for-profit ventures are invited to take the class and develop their ideas. Being able to develop a coherent venture plan is great training for anyone who wants to work in the government, nonprofit or business sectors. The course attempts to convey a picture of what a well-considered and well-executed plan looks like with the goal of developing in students an appreciation for clear thinking in the pursuit of social value creation.",

The course objective is to develop theoretical understanding, critical judgment, and practical skills for sensitive and effective engagement with financial and economic matters of significance. Students will learn: (a) different ways of thinking about the economic foundations of social policy, (b) the basic terminology, tools, and methods for analyzing the financial statements of a wide range of organizations, and (c) accounting procedures for evaluating business, government, and organizational operations, policies, and practices. This course is at once macro and micro in its orientation: It provides a conceptual basis - derived from mainstream and alternative perspectives - for thinking about the economic dimensions of human development and social policy, and it introduces a set of core competencies for leadership and financial management of organizations, including conventional enterprises, consulting firms, research institutions, governmental agencies, philanthropies, cooperatives, and other third-sector organizations.",

Resilient leaders engage in a continuous process of self-review and refocusing in which they consider the larger environment, engage emotionally and cognitively, and discover new ways to adapt and change. Based on field theory and general systems theory, Strategic Thinking and Communication is designed to strengthen students' leadership competencies to develop a \"strategic stance\" that supports the individual and organizational conditions for effective communication and planning as well as on-going learning and evaluation. Working with Simon and Agazarian's SAVI communication model as well as other diagnostic tools, students will be much more likely to identify/create messages that will get through accurately and effectively and understand as well as develop the knowledge and skills to engage their colleagues, their bosses, their direct reports and other stakeholders in goal-driven conversations. The seminar will emphasize theory to practice and experiential learning. Trying to understand strategic thinking and communication solely through reading and discussion is akin to learning to swim from a book. In addition to theroy and historical frameworks, students in the seminar will learn about their leadership styles, effective ways of communicating through learning SAVI, and solving strategic issues. The course will pay special attention to the intentional and hidden dynamics that support and sometimes undermine effective communication and strategic decision-making. We will also engage with nonprofit leaders from the Philadelphia community hearing their narratives and how they have applied their own strategic thinking to advancing their organizational missions and the sector as a whole.",

    "course_description" : "Social entrepreneurs are individuals with innovative vision seeking to accomplish important public purposes through the creative and aggressive mobilization of people and resources. Using academic theory and research on social entrepreneurship as a framework, student innovators learn to design, develop, and lead social change organizations of their own invention. Students turn their passion for changing the world into concrete plans for launching a venture. Over the course of the semester we will cover a broad array of topics associated with social innovation and entrepreneurship, including defining the problem/opportunity, refining the mission/vision, developing market research and industry analysis, defining a financial and operating structure, assessing results and progress, and scaling an enterprise. The course is neutral on sector. Graduate students in any of Penn's professional schools who want to create social value through either nonprofit or for-profit ventures are invited to take the class and develop their ideas. The class will expose students to the process of getting an organization - regardless of sector - off the ground and running. While this is a class on innovation and entrepreneurship, students do not need to be committed to starting a venture upon graduation. The skills and tools contained in the course have wide applicability in the workplace. Being able to develop a coherent venture plan is great training for anyone who wants to work in government, philanthropy, or the business sector funding or managing existing organizations. The course attempts to convey a picture of what a well-considered and well-executed venture plan looks like with the goal of developing in students an appreciation for clear thinking in the pursuit of the creation of public value. Students will work throughout the term on a plan for an organization that they devise, with assignments spread out throughout the term. Elements of a venture plan will be drafted through multiple class assignments and students present formally and informally several times throughout the semester, receiving feedback from faculty, peers, social entrepreneurs and invited guests. At the end of the term, students will assemble all the pieces they have worked on in the class, revise and hone these elements, and then put them into a coherent venture plan for their organization. This class is ideal preparation for the Dell Social Innovation Challenge (www.dellchallenge.org), which the instructor founded and which awards funds to launch new student socical ventures. Entry into the Challenge is not required, however.",

With group and inter-group relations it is easy to see what went right or wrong in hindsight, or when observing from a distance, but tuning into these dynamics when caught up in them and taking constructive actions when it can have a meaningful impact, requires complex cognitive and emotional processing and use of multiple logics simultaneously. This educational format also explores the mysteries of counter-intuitive principles, such as \"to grow, cut back,\" and \"to strengthen self, augment other,\" are examined. The experiential events that are at the center of this learning occur over two full weekends, one in October and one in November.",

It is for women and men who will take transformative leadership actions that can be successfully implemented by people and groups at all levels of organizations and social enterprises. Recent events have shown that established leadership models need to be revitalized, given the complexities of the contemporary world. Hence this course emphasizes the skills needed to engage in leadership acts relevant to the 21st century, competencies centered on building green technologies, creating sustainable energy, preserving the sanctity of water, fostering environmental-friendly policies, and constructing an economics predicated on principles of abundance rather than scarcity. Case studies of Lincoln, Gandhi, and Mandela will highlight that many of the key leadership lessons required for this era were elegantly crafted by these giants of history in conditions of extreme adversity not unlike the challenges of today. Key topics are decision making under conditions of uncertainty, building meaningful authority systems, using power creatively, harnessing the latent potential contained within conflicts and partnering with competitors and adversaries.",

Through a series of individual assignments, class discussions, exercises, and simulations, students will explore and understand the potential for acts of leadership at every level (and in every organization) to create wealth and acheive positive social change. The course is taught by the Executive Director of the Wharton Graduate Leadership Program and is open to graduate students throughout the university as well as Penn undergraduate seniors. In order to create, invoke, and evoke acts of leadership, we must understand ourselves, our teams and organizations, and our environments. From this integrated understanding, a set of possibilities emerge that shape the actions necessary to create positive social change. How can we leverage the abundance of resources available to individuals, teams, organizations, and collective networks? This course will explore leadership in five modules: individual leadership, team leadership, organizational leadership, leadership across boundaries, and network leadership. This seminar style survey course will blend didactic, dialogic, and experiential methods to build an integrated framework for analysis that identifies and amplifies the opportunities or acts of leadership.",

How are these decisions made, and who benefits from these decisions?

To what extent can large donors influence the mission of the organization? What is an appropriate social return on investment? This course will introduce the factors that influence moral conduct, the ethical issues that arise when pursuing social goals, and discuss the best ways to promote ethical conduct within such organizations. The course will use specific case studies, real and hypothetical, to analyze a variety of ethical issues that arise (including finance, governance, accountability, fundraising, labor (paid and unpaid), client groups, and service provision) among the multiple stakeholders.

This course will offer an overview of leading social impact measurement methodologies and tools, and an impact measurement field exercise. During the field exercise, student teams will assess one or more major grants made by local individual and institutional grantmakers using their standard system of measurement. Teams will present the result of their assessment and offer feedback to improve each grantmaker's measurement practices.

This course is at once macro and micro in its orientation: It provides a conceptual basis - derived from mainstream and alternative perspectives - for thinking about the economic dimensions of human development and social policy, and it introduces a set of core competencies for leadership and financial management of organizations, including conventional enterprises, consulting firms, research institutions, governmental agencies, philanthropies, cooperatives, and other third-sector organizations.",

    "course_description" : "Thinking like a designer can transform the way people and organizations develop products, services, processes, and strategy. This approach, called design thinking, brings together what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable. It also allows people who aren't trained as designers to use creative tools to address a vast range of challenges. Design thinking is a deeply human process that taps into abilities we all have but get overlooked by more conventional problem-solving practices. It relies on our ability to be intuitive, to recognize patterns, to construct ideas that are emotionally meaningful as well as functional, and to express ourselves through means beyond words or symbols. Sarah Lidgus, a writer and strategist with the design firm IDEO and, formerly the non-profit IDEO.org, will lead students through an immersive, hands-on class in order to demonstrate the philosophy and practice of design thinking. Design thinking is something you can learn only by doing, so we'll get out into the world and tackle a design challenge of our own together. We'll learn how to research by researching, learn how to prototype by prototyping. At the end of the class you should feel confident in your abilities to apply design thinking to any challenges you're facing - and to come up with new ideas and solutions as a result.",
