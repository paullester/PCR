Enrollment in this program does not count towards the Master of Architecture degree. The intent of the drawing component of the course is to familiarize the student with primarily black and white mediums (pencil, charcoal, ink, etc). Exercises are designed to sharpen the student's ability to see selectively and to transform image to paper through both line and tonal renditions in freehand sketch form. Exercises will also familiarize the student with basic drafting skills necessary for architectural communication and provide an introduction to computer-aided design through applications of the intensive Rhino and Illustrator tutorials given in the Digital Navigation course. The design part of the course presents a rhythm of basic three-dimensional design studies and simple architectural studio investigations. These are intended to build fundamental skills and acquaint the student with the architectural issues of form/space, conceptualization, transformation of scale, simple functional and constructional problems and a sensitivity to context.",

The course is organized as series of loops between media, layering and capturing their intrinsic effects and intensifying the potential for new expression. A series investigations parallel discussions with artists and architects exploring representations of space and form; visits to galleries, museums and architecture offices provide a window into the relationship between the the instruments and media utilized to project built form and the preceding propositional representations.

    "course_description" : "Acknowledging the ubiquitous proliferation of \"Hi-Tech\" architecture in contemporary London, this research seminar examines the scope of technology as it emerges and re-emerges in the work of various architects currently dominating the city. This scope includes the last strains of post-war urbanism which spawned a legacy of radical archtecture directly contributing to the Hi-Tech; a particular focus of the course will be the contributing and contrasting influence provided by the counter-cultural groups of the 60's- Archigram, Superstudio, the Metabolists and others. Using the premise of Archigram's idea of infrastructure, both literal and of event, the course will attempt to discover relational networks between works of the present day (Rogers, Foster, Grimshaw, etc.). As this work practices upon and within public space, an understanding of the contribution of technology to urban theatricality will evolve which is relevant to contemporary spheres of technological design practices. Students will be required to produce and present a term research paper.",

Modern buildings are characterized by the use of such complex systems that not only have their own characteristics, but interact dynamically with one another and with the building skin and occupants. Questions about building size, shape, and construction become much more complex with the introduction of sophisticated feedback and control systems that radically alter their environmental behavior and resource consumption. Class meetings are divided between slide lectures, demonstrations, and site visits. Course work includes in-class exercises, homework assignments, and a comprehensive environmental assessment of a room in a building on campus.",

Algorithmic imaging and molecular tools found useful in analyzing nonlinear biological systems may therefore prove to be of value to new directions in design within architecture. This course situates itself at the nexus between architecture and nonlinear systems biology - and in the context of the Sabin+Jones LabStudio at UPenn - to gain insight into living systems, develop techniques for digital modeling, and create experimental designs with rigor at various length scales, from the microscopic to the human. Part seminar and part workshop, it serves to deepen knowledge of nonlinear biosynthesis, a synthesis of design thinking and tooling through the study of systems biology. Students will develop a series of digital and physical models through the use of 3D printing and a diverse range of scripting and modeling techniques in parametric and associative software. The final assignment is a design project with accompanying abstract and report.",

Industrial designers develop these concepts and specifications through collection, analysis and synthesis of user needs data guided by the special requirements of the client or manufacturer. They are trained to prepare clear and concise recommendations through drawings, models and verbal descriptions. The profession has evolved to take its appropriate place alongside Engineering and Marketing as one of the cornerstones of Integrated Product Design teams. The core of Industrial Design's knowledge base is a mixture of fine arts, commercial arts and applied sciences utilized with a set of priorities that are firstly on the needs of the end user and functionality, then the market and manufacturing criteria. This course will provide an overview and understanding of the theories, thought processes and metholologies employed in the daily practice of Industrial Design. This includes understanding of ethnographic research and methodologies, product problem solving, creative visual communication, human factors / ergonomics application and formal and surface development in product scale. This course will not enable one to become an industrial designer but will enable one to understand and appreciate what industrial design does, what it can contribute to society and why it is so much fun.",

    "course_description" : "This seminar will develop entries to the Vertical Cities Asia International Design Competition: www.verticalcitiesasia.com/. Organized by the National University of Singapore School of Design and Environment, and sponsored by the World Future Foundation, the competition is predicated on the belief that a new paradigm of high-density compact urban settlement is necessary for rapidly urbanizing Asian territories besieged by massive rural-urban migrations. Jettisoning the notion of recycling existing urban architectural models to accommodate increasing populations with devastating effects on land, infrastructure, and the environment, the competition endeavors to elaborate fundamentally new models of urbanization within a rapidly transforming 21st century Asian milieu. Each year, a one square kilometer territory is the subject of the competition. Students are asked to develop approaches to housing 100,000 people living and working within this zone. This premise sets the stage for tremendous research and investigation into urban density, verticality, domesticity, work, food, infrastructure, nature, ecology, structure, and program. The holistic integration of these considerations, in concert with a desire to establish entirely new paradigms of urban form is the challenge of this endeavor. Prior competition sites include Chengdu, Seoul and Hanoi. In addition to the 1square km/100k program, each year the competition also defines a broad theme that functions as a lens through which to consider the larger question at hand. Prior themes include fresh air, aging and vertical agriculture. The structure of the course is as follows: The first portion of the seminar will focus on developing a dossier of research related to the particular site and theme of this year's competition (announced in December). This work will be developed collectively within the seminar. The second portion of the seminar will explore canonical 20th century proposals for new urban form and settlement. This work will be developed individually with each student contributing a short chapter on their case study for the seminar dossier. The remaining portion of the seminar will focus on the elaboration of individual strategies for a new 1 sq km urban district for 100,000 residents. While this is not a studio, the expectation remains that students will develop their individual propositions using a range of visual means and modeling techniques.",

The conceptual focus centered on the program of dwelling and how this program can be employed to develop and promote dynamic relationships and conditions through time, both within the building and between the building and the context. Through research and experimentation students integrate ecological processes into their design methodology to support design innovations in the building's structure, its construction assemblies, environmental systems, and materials.

Modern buildings are characterized by the use of such complex systems that not only have their own characteristics, but interact dynamically with one another and with the building skin and occupants. Questions about building size, shape, and construction become much more complex with the introduction of sophisticated feedback and control systems that radically alter their environmental behavior and resource consumption. Class meetings are divided between slide lectures, demonstrations, and site visits. Course work includes in-class exercises, homework assignments, and a comprehensive environmental assessment of a room in a building on campus. Open to Intensive Majors only. Prerequisite: ARCH 433",

In the literature on villa gardens across the centuries, from ancient Rome to the 20th century, there emerges a recurrent opposition between the country seen as an occasion for self-improvement versus it being an opportunity for self- indulgence, the representation of social status, and at times the display of opulence and political power. In an examination of the circularity of villa ideology across the centuries, other themes will emerge that address the relationship between urban and rural life, between architecture and natural environment and between social, cultural, economic, and political forces and landscape design. These themes will be explored through the study of selected villas and through the reading of sources drawn from villa literature, including architectural and agricultural treatises, epistolary exchanges, and drawings.",

Performance analysis techniques can provide enormous amounts of information to support the design process, acting as feedback mechanisms for improved performance, but careful interpretation and implementation are required to achieve better buildings. Energy, lighting, and air flow are the three main domains covered in the workshop. Students will learn how to utilize domain tools at an advanced level, and utilize them as applications to examine the environmental performance of existing buildings. Using the results of analytical techniques, the students will develop high-performance design strategies in all three domains. Lectures will be given on specific topics each week. A series of analytical class exercises will be assigned to provide students with hands-on experience in using the computer models. A case-study building will be provided at the beginning of the course and students will model different components each week throughout the semester.

Washington Library in Chicago. In addition to site function, and construction, architecture is affected by style, and today there are many different stylistic approaches. Style is neglected in most discussions of architecture yet it is central to the design and appreciation of buildings. The seminar will examine the role that style plays in the work of prominent contemporary architects both in the United States and abroad. Field trips, seminars and selected readings will form the basis for four graphic and written assignments.",
