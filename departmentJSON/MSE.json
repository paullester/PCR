The course focuses on techniques for the simulation/modeling of materials on a time and/or length scale that is large compared with atomistic/molecular but with structure that is fine on the scale of typical (homogenized) continuum theory. The course explores kinetic models, defect dynamics, and statistical mechanics models and their implementation in computer simulation.",

Starting with the band structure of solids, the course will give an overview of electronic, dielectric, magnetic, optical and optoelectronic properties of materials and devices. The treatment will use quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical concepts familiar to students at the undergraduate level. Commonly used theories and models will be introduced and their predictions will be compared with observations. Students who have taken MSE 221/MSE 260 and/or MSE 570 will benefit from this advanced introduction to material properties.",

The course assumes an undergraduate background in any area of physical/chemical science and undergraduate mathematics appropriate to this. The course will also be accessible to students of applied mathematics.",

The selection of materials has been based on availability and functionality. The rapid advances of materials technologies in the last 150 years, however, have made nearly all classes and forms of materials available, at a cost. Therefore, in theory at least, materials selection can now proceed on a rational basis as an optimization process. In this course, we will focus on structural applications where mechanical design is central. By the end of the course, the students can expect to acquire a level of engineering familiarity with a broad range of materials, and be prepared to undertake material design projects in the future.",
