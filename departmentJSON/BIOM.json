It will provide an introduction to important topics in biostatistical concepts and reasoning, and practical experience with elementary data management and analysis. Specific topics include tools for describing and summarizing data; inference methods on population means and proportions; statistical hypothesis testing; group comparisons; simple linear regression; categorical data analysis; time-to-event data analysis; and issues in study designs. Lab sessions will help students learn and implement the methods using the R statistical programming language. Though there are some formulae and computational elements to the course, the emphasis is on interpretation, concepts and applications There will be a lecture on Mondays from 3:30 - 4:30 pm and labs on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday from 3:30 - 5:00 pm. Students will need to bring their own laptop and will be expected to pick a lab day and stick with that day throughout the semester.",
