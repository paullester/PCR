We will consider beliefs in the persisting agency of the dead, in the efficacy of divination and techniques for attaining various forms of 'transcendence', and in 'scripture' as a source of knowledge and guide to action. We will review the history of early chinese observations of celestial phenomena and the cosmological models that captured their regularities. We will also look at theories of the human body, and practices for maintaining health and responding to disease. ------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The early Chinese evidence will be considered against the background of questions regarding the nature of scientific and religious activities, their cultural role, and their interrelationship. How did early Chinese thinking respond to predictability and irregularity? How were correlation and casuality conceived? What kinds of non-human agents were posited and what roles were granted to them? How did scientific and religious ideas form, circulate, attain prestige and become contested, and how were they deployed as sources of social power?",

    "course_description" : "In popular imagination, premodern Japan has long been associated with its hereditary warrior class, the samurai. Countless movies (recently the appalling Last Samurai ) have explored the character and martial prowess of these men. Yet warriors constituted but a tiny portion of the societies they inhabited and ruled, and historians researching medieval Japan have turned their attentions to a great range of subjects and to other classes (elite and commoner alike). This seminar is designed to acquaint students with the challenge of researching the broader world of medieval Japan (ca. 1110-1600). In the course of the semester, through a broad range of readings of primary sources (in translation) and modern English-language scholarship, students will be introduced to the peculiarities (limitations and opportunities) of research in premodern history.",

The course will take an interdisciplinary approach to situating bodies in history through an examination of religious, medical, literary, and visual sources, against the backdrop of various theoretical approaches from across gender studies, medical anthropology, and cultural theory. We will attempt to map the Chinese body by surveying the multiples ways in which it was imagined and depicted in religion, literature, art, and popular culture.",

Furthermore, Korea emerged from an aid-recipient to a donor country. Many developing economies in particular took note, seeking to learn policy lessons from Korea's development experiences. Taught by a former governor of the Bank of Korea, a Penn Economics Ph.D., this course covers three themes. The first part examines the sources of successes for rapid industrialization with maintaining fair income distributions during the first five decades since Korea's liberation from the Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Government-led development strategy was instrumental to bringing such remarkable socioeconomic achievements. Part II analyzes how Korea overcame major economic crises, in the late 1990s and in recent years. Korea recovered more quickly than most of the neighboring economies experiencing crises at the same time. Third, we examine Korea's continued efforts to integrate its economy into the global economy further through, among others, Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with advanced economies such as the United States.",

This state of affairs is hardly historically unique- complex interconnections have existed for centuries. Yet this course looks behind the numbers to consider whether the current moment is qualitatively different from earlier iterations of globalization. How do we understand a roadbuilt by Chinese laborers in Nigeria, a \"Chinese\" airport in Sudan, a copper mine in Zambia, a gold mine in Peru, oil investments in Venezuela and Ecuador, or massively increasing trade with Brazil? Together we will explore Chinese state and firm-level interventions in Africa and Latin America as harbingers of an emergent global economic structure, largely defined by intensified and re-configured South-South linkages. Through the disciplinary methods of anthropology, political economy, management, and media studies we will consider both the historical context of intensified Chinese involvement in these regions and a wide range of more contemporary ethnographies and case studies. In the process, we will subject transnational economic studies, the statements of managers and officials, and popular culture texts alike to fine-grained readings.",

    "course_description" : "Korean Wave (Hallyu), a Korean popular culture phenomenon, is currently raging throughout Asia and is making its way to the West(maybe?) From Korean tele-dramas and K-pop music to their respective celebrity icons, these popular cultural forms from Korea are increasingly becoming part of the everyday landscape and vocabulary. We will attempt to understand and evaluate this cultural phenomenon--its promises and limitations as well as its popularity and backlash against it. More specifically, this course explores the ways in which television, music, manhwa (comic books), and the internet participate in the transnational production and circulation of culture, modernity, tradition, ideology, and politics. One of the central topics that the spring 2007 course will consider is the curious ways in which popular culture repeatedly restages (or translates) Korea's past in order to comment on its present. For example, we will study television dramas such as \"The Immortal Yi Sunsin\" (Korea-Japan relations), \"Chumong\" (Reclamation of northeastern China as part of ancient Korea), and \"Goong\" (Imagining Korea as a constitutional monarchy with its royal family). In addition to these primary texts, we will read theoretical and critical writings on mass culture, new media, narratology, and translation. Some of the specific topics we will consider are: The \"Yonsama\" phenomenon and the marketing of new masculinity; Korean emotions and melodrams; Imitation vs. Innovation in K-pop; Fictions of history i n historical soap operas; Revival of folk culture; Preservation of traditional values in Postmodern times; Repatriation of Korean American pop stars to Korea; and Youth culture.

Through the consideration of such relationships, we will come to engage with larget questions of artistic autonomy versus the commodified production of art, connecting them to an understanding of the history of literary and artistic production in Japan and elsewhere. We will analyze the poetics and aesthetics of the Japanese popular music that is used as opening and ending theme songs for anime and live-action dramas. What is the significance of the fact that on any given week it is not uncommon for nearly half of the songs in the Top 10 chart to be theme songs for not only anime and TV dramas, but even for weekly TV sports shows or advertising selling anything from fleeces to station wagons? In addition to examining the relationship, or lack thereof, between the music and the shows, by tracing the life-cycle of stories such \"Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit\" and \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" through their incarnations as popular literature or serialized graphic novels, animation, cinema, etc. students will be guided to consider the distinct features of each genre and medium, as well as the aesthetic principles involved in adaptation from one genre/medium to another. As the semester progresses students will acquire skills of close reading and analysis of various kinds of texts, focusing on their narrative, poetic, visual, and musical components. Throughout the semester we will also engage in a literature review of the expanding body of academic publications on Japanese popular culture. Pre-requisites: EALC 002 or EALC 069 or permission from the instructor.",

Our discussion will begin by critically examining the alleged common characteristics of traditional Chinese culture and society, such as patrilineal kinship and Confusian ethics. About Maoist era, we will discuss the impacts of the radical socialist movements, such as Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, on local communties, families, and individuals. Later we will analyze the increasingly complex cultural and social landscapes of the Post-Mao China: How did the one-child policy contribute to the rediscovery of childhood and the emerging consumer culture in China? Have the new job opportunities created by the socialist market economy improvedwomen's status? What are the effects of the multinational corporations on the local communities? How can we explain the relation between the creation of social stigma and infectious diseases such as AIDS?",

It will also involve a study of Korean politics, US politics--e.g., the MacArthur vs. Truman-MacArthur controversy; and international politics--the roles of Stalin and Mao, the role of the war on US servicemen, sand on the Korean civilian populace. We will look at the war in retrospect--the shaping of an America-Korean relationship, the Korean Diaspora in America. And of course we will examine it as a war America didn't win. So \"Korea: The Forgotten War Remembered\" is a war course insofar as we conceive war as a totally engulfing social experience that effects the participating nations and societies in ways far deeper than simply statistics of how many casualties were suffered, how much territory was seized, and the like. It will address larger issues than simply military strategy and tactics, great generals and poor leadership. It will seek to capture more broadly the historical significance of the Korean War: it's impact on Koreans and Americans and the Korean-American relationship, it's role in determining US-China relations for a generation, and it's place in Cold War history.",

Our course discussion begins with a critical investigation into traditional societies based on patriarchy, Confucian ethics, and subsistence agriculture and how they have changed since their initial encounters with expanding global capitalism. This course then examines how the recently intensifying transnational movements of capital, commodities, people, and \"cultures\" have created particular cultural and societal forms in the region. Drawing on ethnographic, historical, and political literature about the three countries, students can understand how the particular culture and economy of each country have contributed to creating different paths of their historical-cultural transformations. Our topics include: changes in traditional families and gender roles, international wars and massive modernization movements; corporate culture and its local variations; domestic and international labor migration and the conditions of migrant workers; international marriages and transnational flow of brides; US-based fast food restaurants and food crisis; emerging consumerism and commodification of childhood, \"odorless\" Japanese cultural products and their popularity in Asian countries.",

We will explore famous tombs such as the Tomb of the First Emperor and less well-known artifacts of peoples such as the Scythians and Qidan. We will compare the excavated material with what we can find out about ancient China from other sources, especially literature and standard historical accounts, to find out whether the ideas put forth in history and literature are accurate. Finally, we will study Chinese art in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Philadelphia Museum of Art in comparison to the excavated objects.",

Poets from Byron to Robert Lowell, through Ezra Pound to Li Po, have written as though they were women, decrying their painful situations. Is something wrong with this picture, or is \"woman\" such a fascinating position from which to speak that writers can hardly help trying it on for size? In this course we will look at male literary impersonators of women as well as women writers. Our questions will include who speaks in literature for prostitutes--whose bodies are the property of men--and what happens when women inhabit the bodies of other women via spirit possession. Readings will draw on the Japanese traditions, which is especially rich in such cases, and will also include Western and Chinese literature, anthropological work on possession, legal treatments of prostitution, and film. Participants will keep a reading journal and write a paper of their own choosing.",

    "course_description" : "From an empire to a republic, from a communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism, reform and revolution, the Nationalist regime, Mao's China, the Cultural Revolution, and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism. We will conclude with a critical review of the concept of \"Greater China\" that takes into account Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora in order to attain a more comprehensive understanding of modern China, however defined, at the end of the last century.",

Are rural peasants and the emerging underclass of urban laid-off workers being left behind by market transition? How are minorities faring in China's transition? How does the emerging digital divide play into the dichotomies of east-west and urban-rural in China? What is the plight of millions of \"floaters\" migrating into China's cities, with minimal legal rights and protections? Can China's rapidly-changing public health system handle emerging diseases such as SARS and AIDS? How has the one-child policy affected women, children, and society in China? Who are the \"missing girls\" of China, and what are the social implications of their disappearance? How was the welfare of children and adolescents changed with market reforms?

The fact that in modern times many Japanese writers had medical educations makes Japanese literature, studied here in translation, a rich context for exploring a wide range of such questions. Film too will be a tool for our studies. A comparative look at what we might think about the body, the mind, and healing or dying processes will be the central focus of this seminar.",

How have Japanese writers responded to the horrors of war and to the memories of Japan's imperial past? We explore these and other questions by reading literature of various genres, such as novels, short stories, plays, film scripts, poetry, manga, as well as academic essays.

In popular imagination, pre-modern Japan has long been associated with its hereditary warrior class. Countless movies have explored the character and martial prowess of these men. Yet warriors constituted but a tiny portion of the societies they inhabited and ruled, and historians researching medieval Japan have turned their attentions to a great range of subjects and to other classes (elite and commoner alike). This class is designed to acquaint students with the complex and diverse centuries that have been called the \"Age of the Samurai\"-roughly, the years between ca. 1110 and 1850. In the course of the semester, we will explore the central themes in the historiography of warrior society, while introducing some of the defining texts that have shaped our imagination of this age (from laws to epic poems, from codes of conduct to autobiographies).",

The course begins with the Laozi, the one text affirmed by virtually all \"Daoist\" traditions as foundational. The readings include several other \"Daoist\" texts, covering a period of roughly one thousand years, and will conclude with a survey of meditation and longevity techniques, practices which sometimes have no textual basis whatsoever.

Using primary texts in translation, this course explores the complex relationship between poets and painters, intellectual creators and visual artists, over the history of China, Japan, and Korea, from the beginnings of the civil bureaucracy in China in the first century through the rise of women as literati artists in Japan. Students will develop analytic skills through discussion of written texts and painted representations; they will become familiar with a variety of visual artists and forms as well as with the broad sweep of East Asian history. Background inAsian language and culture is not required.",

The course is primarily intended for graduate students but is also open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor. The course is taught in English, and all of the readings will be available in English translation. An optional discussion section may be arranged for those students who are able and willing to read and discuss materials in Japanese.",

How to understand the continuities and discontinuities of the last three imperial dynasties of China will be the central focus of our survey. How did these different ethnic groups adjust to each other's way of life? Did complicated cultural interaction prompt different visions of empires? How did the meaning of \"Chinese change over this time period? How did international politics shape the fate of Chinese empires? With no assumption of prior knowledge, lectures open with an overview of Chinese society before the eve of the Mongolian invasion, and then trace the changing visions of ethnic and social orders in the subsequent regimes ruled by three different ethnic groups (Mongolian, Han Chinese, and Manchurian). We will examine and compare bureaucratic operations, cultural ideals, domestic and international policies from above as well as the daily life experiences from below. The course will conclude with an analysis of the collapse of the imperial order at the beginning of the twentieth century, after it was severely challenged by a semi-Christian Utopian movement from within and global drug trade imperialist attacks from without.",

To this end, the course will encourage us to be critical readers of various sources of information: historical materials, scholarly essays, contemporary journalism, fiction, and film.",

In the course of each case study, lectures and discussions will branch out from the main source to examine its historical context as well as the (political, cultural, textual) traditions that informed that source s composition. In general, students will read the entire texts of the main sources (or significant portions of them), along with scholarly articles and shorter excerpts from other sources, composed at the same time or in the same vein/genre.

No prerequisites. All films with English subtitles. Special attention to genres of Korean film such as the melodrama, slapstick comedy, and erotica. No prerequisites.

The course will take an interdisciplinary approach to situating bodies in history through an examination of religious, medical, literary, and visual sources, against the backdrop of various theoretical approaches from across gender studies, medical anthropology, and cultural theory. We will attempt to map the Chinese body by surveying the multiples ways in which it was imagined and depicted in religion, literature, art, and popular culture.",

    "course_description" : "Mummies of the Silk Road This course takes advantage of, and is premised upon, the unique opportunity afforded by the extraordinary exhibition entitled \"Secrets of the Silk Road,\" which is being shown at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology from February 5-June 5, 2010. The exhibition is comprised of more than a hundred objects, including two mummies (roughly 1800 BC and 800 BC) and the magnificent trappings of a third (early 5th century AD). Among the artifacts are attractive foodstuffs, splendid textiles, finely made shoes, unusual headgear, beautiful jewelry, evocative statues and figurines, mysterious mortuary accessories, manuscripts in a variety of languages and scripts, Sasanian coins, fine paintings, and much else besides. All of these materials come from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People's Republic of China, which geographically may be referred to as Eastern Central Asia (ECA) and ethnically as Uyghurstan or East Turkestan. We will study eac of the items for the exhibition in depth and will also reference other related mummies (actually naturally desiccated corpses) and materials from the museums and archaeological institutes of the XUAR. In the process of doing so, we will familiarize ourselves with the inhabitants, languages, places, and history of the region. Moreover, it is the aim of the course to situate ECA within the context of the whole of Eurasia. Our discussions will touch upon ancient and modern DNA, blood types, physical anthropology, bronze technology, the spread of agriculture and oasis technology, the utilization of the horse and other domesticated animals, wheeled vehicles, textiles, climate, geography, and all other aspects of the region that are relevant to life there during the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and medieval period.",

Through the methods of anthropology, science and technology studies and political economy, we will focus primarily on technological development and innovation in contemporary China. We will consider a wide range of ethnographies, case studies, and historical accounts in order to ask the following questions: What are some of the discourses of evaluation which make possible changing views of East Asian economies by economists, officials, businesspeople and laborers? What does it mean to identify and characterize national economic cultures in the region, for example, those supposedly timeless markers of Chinese economic distinctiveness like the concept of guanxi? And lastly, how do divergent conceptions of technological development make possible new forms of life and labor?",

During the first few weeks, readings will familiarize students with the growing body of English-language scholarship on pilgrimage in the ancient, medieval, and early modern periods. In the second half of the semester, we shall focus more narrowly on the early modern period, when the emergence of mass tourism redefined the ends and the experience of travel and pilgrimage, which now became available to commoners as well as elites. In particular, we shall examine the recent scholarly attention to the links between travel and the emerging publishing industry in the development of a proto-national Japanese identity; we shall consider how recent works have challenged the long-established, one-dimensional view of the Tokugawa period as conservative and dominated by an oppressive regime bent on \"freezing\" the social order and quashing commoner initiative and mobility. Students will be expected to take turns presenting on readings, to write a historiographical paper at the end of the term, and three short book reviews during the course of the semester. The short papers should be handed in no more than three weeks after the book was discussed in class.",

Korea has achieved a remarkable economic success during the past half a century. Dubbed the Miracle on the Han River, Korea is the first country in the world to successfully transition from an aid recipient to a donor country, thanks to condensed growth strategy. While its success has far surpassed the average growth performances of most developing economies during the past decades, Korea is still categorized as an emerging economy. An advanced economy arguably has various defining characteristics such as (1) flexible institutions in line with global norms; (2) policies less prone to crisis; (3) resilient economic system capable of overcoming and dealing with crisis; (4) contributions to global prosperity through active participation in development assistance and global economic cooperation; and (5) respect for universal value by economic agents. From this perspective, we will consider major challenges for Korea, including (1) increasing potential output; (2) institutional reform in compliance with global norms; (3) active contribution to global economic cooperation; and (4) preparation for reunification.",

This course will accord greater attention to \"vernacular\" art including amulets, cartoons, film, tattoos, photographs, and even plastic dolls. Instead of concentrating on the origins of pieces of art, readings in this course look at art as it exists and operates in dynamic ritual activities and highly complex synchronic and diachronic relationships. The polities of \"museumification\" of Buddhist ritual items, as well as the political, and emotional lives of images will also be closely examined.",

We will explore topics including the Buddhist accommodation of Chinese family system, Chinese transformation of the bodhisattva Guanyin, female deities in Daoist and popular religious pantheons, writings about religious women, female ghosts and fox spirits in literary imagination and folk tales, and the significance of yin force in Chinese medicine and Daoist alchemy. Through the case of China, we will look at how gender plays critical and constitutive roles in religious traditions, and how religion can be used both to reinforce and to challenge gender norms.",

Some of the objects are well-known and on permanent display. Others have hardly been researched since they were acquired, and rarely leave storage. The class will meet in small groups at the museum. Students will work on research papers and collaborative in-class presentations on objects of their choice. A variety of approaches will be encouraged and students may choose to focus on iconography, historical and religious context, materials and manufacturing techniques, collectors and patronage, or inscriptions. There are no prerequisites for this course.",
