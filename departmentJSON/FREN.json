    "course_description" : "Within the context of the ill-defined, heterogeneous genre of the travelogue and of today's age of globalization, CNN and the Internet, this seminar will examine the poetics of travel writing based largely albeit not exclusively on travel notebooks, or journaux/carnets de voyage, spanning the XXth century from beginning to end. One of the principal specificities of the texts studied is that they all evince to a lesser or greater degree a paradoxical resistance both to the very idea of travel(ing) as such and to the mimetic rhetoric of traditional travel narratives. We will therefore look at how modern or postmodern texts question, revisit, subvert or reject such key notions of travel literature as exoticism, nostalgia, exile, nomadism, otherness or foreignness vs. selfhood, ethnology and autobiography, etc. Authors considered will include Segalen, Morand, Michaux, Leiris, Levi-Strauss, Butor, Le Clezio, Baudrillard, Bouvier, Jouanard, Leuwers.",

Finally, in order to use and practice the new economic and business terminology studied in this course, and to also further explore the structure, the management, and the operations of the French companies, students will work in pairs on a research project about a major French company of their choice. One of the other goals of this course is to also prepare the students to take one of the exams offered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry: the Diplome de Francais Professionnel, Affaires, C1.

By means of films, short novels and a basic historical text, we will consider the shifts in lifestyle, values, and identity among youth at critical moments in the history of the last 50 years. Conducted entirely in French, this course requires the student to view 7 films outside of class, 1 written mid-term in class, reaction paragraphs for each film, 3 of which will be expanded to relate the films to the required readings of Francoise Sagan, Georges Perec and Rachid Djaidani. Students will also present to the class their research upon some aspect of youth culture or identity of their choice. The written part of that presentation will be integrated into the final exam paper.",

What is the present and future role of the French language in the face of globalization? How are language attitudes similar and different among French-speaking and English-speaking regions of the world? In what ways does the language we speak and the way we speak it shape our identities?

In literature, this obsession manifests itself most clearly in the epistolary novel, which became the privileged form of expression chosen by all the major authors of the age. Because of the rise of epistolarity, the art of \"writing to the moment,\" in Richardson's memorable formulation, must be seen as one of the Enlightenment's principal voices. And, for the first time, the letter became a highly valued means of communication, in both the private and the public domains. We will read most of the major epistolary novels beginning with the genre's first classic, \"Lettres portugaises,\" and ending with its masterpiece, \"Liaisons dangereuses.\" We will consider some real correspondences--for example, Sevigne's and Diderot's--to see how the urge to turn them into novels proved irresistible, to editors and authors alike. Finally, we will read several examples of what was known as the \"public\" letter, philosophical texts that used the epistolary form (for example, Diderot's \"Lettre sur les aveugles\"), to see how the techniques of epistolarity survived the transition into the realm of the polemical.",

Such broad categories as distortions of space and time, reason and madness, order and disorder, sexual transgressions, self and other will be considered.

In an effort to better understand how the horror film makes us confront out worst fears and our most secret desires alike, we will look at the genre's main iconic figures (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc.) as well as issues of ethics, gender, sexuality, violence, spectatorship through a variety of critical lenses (psychoanalysis, socio-historial and cultural context, aesthetics,...).",

    "course_description" : "French 202 is a one-semester third-year level French course. It is designed to prepare students for subsequent study in upper-level courses in French and francophone literature, linguistics, civilization, cinema, etc. It is required for students who have completed 140 and recommended for those with an equivalent level, wishing to continue in more advanced French courses or preparing for study abroad. Exceptions can be made with permission of the undergraduate chair. It is also an appropriate course for those students who have time for only one more French course and wish to solidify their knowledge of the language by continuing to work on all four skills--speaking, listening, reading and writing. Students' work will be evaluated both in terms of progress in language skillsand of ability to handle and engage in the content areas. This course does not include a systematic review of French grammar (that is done in FREN 212). Nevertheless, through the diverse writing assessments (e.g., creative writing; essays), the various textual and visual references (e.g., novels; articles; films; clips), the communicative approach, the students will play an active role in their learning process and consequently will be led to consolidate and deepen their grammatical competence. The class studies two thematic units dealing with a wide variety of magazine articles, literary texts, historical documents, movies, songs, etc. In the first dossier, students get a chance to expand their knowledge of French history, with one major focus on World War II and the German occupation of France. In the second dossier, students study contemporary France focusing on issues such as the modern family, education, pop culture. While touching upon issues of identity in France, the class engages the students into an intercultural dialogue which enables them to be more aware of the differences and similarities between the two countries.",

Second, it will contrast these cliches of France and its people with representations, sometimes no less cliche themselves, produced by the French themselves. Drawing on the discourses found in recent novels, in the comments of politicians of all creeds, in the French media, as well as in popular culture, we will pose the following questions: where do these American and French portraits meet? To what extent do they conflict with each other? What are some of the recurring traits that might suggest some deeper truths, behind the various myths and official discourses on France? The juxtaposition of these two sets of representations will ultimately allow us to arrive at a better understanding not only of \"the French\" as a people, but also of the underlying myths, values and contradictions, which continue to determine France's reality and its place in the play of nations.

Second, as effective communication is based not only on linguistic proficiency but also on cultural proficiency, cultural differences mostly between Americans and French will be explored. Finally, throughout the semester, students will work in groups on the creation of their own business, association, or other organization and will be invited to present their project to the class at the end of the semester. On completion of the course, students will also have the opportunity to take the Diplome de Francais Professionnel-DFP Affaires (C1) administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",
