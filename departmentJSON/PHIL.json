    "course_description" : "Thought and language are like space and time: they are ubiquitous in our daily life, and yet despite their familiarity they rasie some of the deepest and most challenging questions for philosophers. It is commonly held that the contents of sentences and beliefs represent the world, and hence be true or false depending on how things are in the world. It is likewise commonly held that we can use language to communicate the contents of our thoughts, and hence come to share our representations of the world with others. Philosophers ask questions concerning the nature of these representational devices. How do sentences come to represent the world? How does our use of language allow us to communicate with others? What is it to understand a language? What, for that matter, is language itself? We will discuss these and related questions by considering the central theories and debates that have shaped the philosophy of language in the analytic tradition. Readings will include central works by early 20th century philosophers such as Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Paul Grice as well as important pieces by contemporary philosophers. Though some familiarity with philosophy and elementary symbolic logic can help, this course assumes no prior background in philosophy, logic or linguistics.",

    "course_description" : "Expressivism: Emotions, Evaluations, and Linguistic Meaning: In this seminar, we will explore the virtues and drawbacks of expressivism, broadly construed. Most contemporary philosophers of language analyze meaning in terms of truth-conditional content: how the world would have to be for an assertion or other speech act to be satisfied. But in many cases, it's unclear just what ontologically rrespectable facts could make our utterances true. Further, much of our communicative activity appears to be aimed at affecting our iinterlocutors' hearts and actions as much as their minds. If some aspects of conventional linguistic meaning involve the expression of evaluative or emotional attitudes rather than (just) truth-conditional content, how should a theory of meaning analyze this? We'll begin with classic discussions of moral emotivism (e.g. Ayer, Hare) and more recent versions of expressivism in ethics (e.g. Gibbard, Blackburn), paying special attention to the Frege-Geach problem. Next, we'll turn to recent discussions of epithets, especially racial slurs, in the philosophy of language (e.g. Williamson, Brandom, Hornsby), tracing out similarities and contrasts with moral expressivism.",

What factors other than natural selection determine evolution and how important are they? To what extent do genes affect our behavior? Does the race have a biological basis? What is biodiversity and why should we care about it? In this course we will examine these questions from a philosophical point of view. This course will have two parts. In the firsst part we will examine the foundations of evolutionary theory, starting off with Darwin's own formulation. We will then look at external and interal criticisms of evolutionary theory. Topics will include creationism and intelligent design, adaptationism, and the units of selection debate. In the second part of the course we will apply this knowledge to contemporary ethical issues. We will focus on biological theories of race and gender and examine their criticisms. We will also discuss the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory, the emergence of ecosystem ecology and the concept of biodiversity and its role in environmental policy.

Our topical focus will be some of the main questions in moral philosophy. We'll consider questions from each main branch of conteporary moral philosophy. We will start by talking about issues in applied ethics. Applied ethics is concerned with analyzing the moral status of very specific types of acts. Applied ethics is ocncerned with analyzing the moral status of very specific types of acts. Applied ethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are we morally required to give to charity?', 'Is it ever morally permissible to have an abortion?', and 'Is it ever morally permissible to kill a non-combatant in wartime?'. We will use underlying disagreements about applied ethics to segue into a unit on normative ethics. Normative ethics is concerned with the general features of acts that make them right, wrong, good, or bad. Normative ethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are only the consequences relevant for determining what's right and wrong?', Do people have moral rights?', 'What does it take for one's life to go best?', and 'What is virtue?'. We will use underlying disagreements about normative ethics to segue into our third and final unit, which is about metaethics. Metaethics is concerned with the nature of moral stuff, moral talk, and moral thought. Metaethicists are interested in questions such as 'Are moral facts the kind of facts investigated by the sciences?', 'Are there any moral facts?', 'Do we know any moral facts?'. and 'Are moral facts objective?'. At the very end of the course, we will come back to applied ethics in order to see how spending a semester thinking about moral philosophy changes the ways we approach applied questions",

Maybe it doesn't even make sense to attribute responsibilities, liabilities, or agency to corporations. If businesses do indeed have moral responsibilities, perhaps that means that employees have corresponding rights against their employers. With a better understanding of how the ethical world intersects with the business world, we can thoughtfully discuss the place of the corporation in society.",

We will deal with a number of case studies, mostly recent, but some crucial historical cases as well. Our readings will be primarily philosophical texts, supplemented with those from other fields, such as psychology, history and sociology, in order to provide empirical context to the theoretical problems facing education today. As a seminar, the instructor welcomes student participation, including students bringing their own interests in educational theory to the classroom. At the same time, the instructor will lecture to the extent necessary to make classroom discussion espcially rich.",

    "course_description" : "As an account of the standard of right conduct, consequentialism is sometimes said to be the view that the rightness of an act is determined entirely by the value of its consequences. Since the 1970s, consequentialism and its most widely-endorsed version, utilitarianism, have been the subjects of a number of influential critiques. Philosophers have contended that consequentialism cannot account for the distinctive values of justice and fairness, for the significance of character, for the agent-relativity of some moral demands, and for the action-guiding function that moral theories are thought to possess. These critiques recommend a close study of the alternative, deontological ethical framework from which many of these critiques originate a framework contending that the right is prior to the good, in John Rawls words. But these critiques have also prompted spirited responses from consequentialists and sophisticated modifications to their theories; these responses are also worth exploring. The focus of this course is to consider and assess some of the important strands in this debate, including the suggestion that neither moral framework adequately captures human concerns about morality and value. We will begin by looking at some of the historical antecedents to the contemporary debate, starting with work by Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick. We will then move forward to the contemporary debate, reading important critiques by John Rawls, Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel, Philippa Foot and others, as well as responses by Peter Railton, Samuel Scheffler, and others. Finally, we will look at recent work by Susan Wolf that provides an alternative perspective on morality, value, and meaningfulness. The readings in this class are challenging, but we will approach them carefully and collaboratively.",

It will consider, among other things, the classic problem of the source of law's authority, exploring whether an unjust law is still a law, and whether law does or ought to bear a close relation to morality. Should Nazi officials or East German border guards be punished if they were \"just following orders\"? What about the judges who enforced the implementation of such laws? Do the conclusions we would reach in the foregoing contexts apply to the conduct of Americans in dealing with suspected terrorists or other detainees? We will consider the divergent answers to these questions suggested by the work of J.L. Austin, H.L.A. Hart, Ronald Dworkin, Joseph Raz, and others. After addressing these traditional jurispruudential inquiries, we will turn to more recent philosophical inquiries in philosophy of law. What is the justification for punishment and how do the various debates in this area play out in specific controversial cases? Is torture ever permissible, whether as part of a scheme of punishment or as part of a system of law enforcement? Is targeted killing a permissible part of just war theory? What should be our stance to government officials who violate the law? As we shall see, each one of these applied topics divides into deontological theorists, on the one hand, and utilitarian, or economic, theorists on the other. We will raise the question of whether these two theories exhaust the possible moves one might make on these various topics, or whether other approaches, such as a contractarian approach, are viable options. The course will require a final, take home exam, as well as attendance, preparation and participation in discussion. The latter will count towards roughly 10% of students' grades.

    "course_description" : "This course seeks to assemble some of the philosophical evidence for feminist claims that traditional political theories are fundamentlaly inadequate because they have not, and presumably cannot, deal with basic facts of gender and the oppression of Women. we will begin by examining the nature of the distinction between sex and gender. This will take us through discussions of: the meaning and significance of categories being socially constructed, the possibility that sexual differences (and inequalities) are in some sense natural and what normative force this has. We will then consider varous attempts to describe the nature of women's oppression. What is it? How does it manifest itself in the lives of women? This will take us through discussions of freedom, constrained choice, ideology, \"consciousness raising\", androcentrism and the relation between, and methodological importance of, ideal and non-ideal theory. Along the way we will be constructing a version of the feminist framework known as the dominance approach and seeing how it analyzes three presumed sites of oppression: sexuality, reproduction and work/family. Among the authors we will be reading are: Elizabeth Anderson, Marily Frye, Sally Haslanger, Rae Langton, Anthony Laden, Catherine MacKinnon, and Susan Okin. The prerequisite for UNDERGRADUATES taking this course is: two philosophy courses (ONE of which is in moral or political philosophy) OR ONE of the following Gender Studies courses: GSWS/PHIL 028, GSWS/PoliSci 280, GSWS 320. There will be one short paper (6-8 pages) with revision, a longer final paper (15 pages) and weekly one-page reflections on a topic from the previous week's discussion.",

In the first half of the course, we will explore Frege's project in *The Foundations of Arithmetic* to ground the truths of mathematics in the truths of logic and the wider contributions to the philosophy of language and mind he made in attempting to carry out this project. In the second half of the course, we will explore Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations* with particular attention to the skeptical worries about rule-following and its implications for the social basis of mental and linguistic representation. In addition to an in-depth study of these primary texts, secondary readings will be drawn from the work of Tyler Burge, Michael Dummett, Meredith Williams, Peter Hacker and others. The ultimate goal of the class is to both introduce students to the work of Frege and Wittgenstein, and to highlight the ways in which their different philosophical methodologies continue to animate debates in analytic philosophy.",

Our goal is to see how philosophical analysis and reasoning can help shed light on some of the central problems of global justice. Samples of these topics include: What are our duties to respond to world poverty and what is the basis of this duty? Is global inequality in itself a matter of justice? How universal are human rights? Should human rights defer to cultural claims at all? Is there a right to intervene in another country to protect human rights there? Indeed can intervention to protect human rights ever be a duty? Who is responsible for the environment? We will read some influential contemporary essays by philosophers on these topics with the goal of using the ideas in these papers as a springboard for further discussion and analysis of our own.",

Although the scientific revolution started modestly with attempts to understand stellar movement, we now know the age and constitution of the universe, the basis of heredity, and we can make and break chemical bonds at will. By all appearances, science seems to have made substantial progress from the scientific revolution to the global scientific enterprise of the 21st century. This course is about how science has generated this knowledge, and whether it has been as progressive and reliable as it seems. We will consider methodological issues such as the sources of scientific knowledge, objectivity, the growing importance of computation in the natural sciences, and the nature of modeling. We will examine products of scientific research: explanations, models, theories, and laws of nature. And we will discuss questions about science and values, including whether non-scientific values can and should enter scientific research, the relationship between science and religion, and the role of the public in guiding the scientific enterprise.",

What are Plato's \"forms\"? What is knowledge and what can be known? Are we born as a blank slate or is something innate in us? What is the good life? What is the best way for us to live our lives? We will see how Plato attempts to answer these quesitons in his early, middle, and late dialogues, and we will ask whether and how exactly he is self-critical and changes his views over time.",

How we discover, create, communicate, and comprehend meaning has been one of the central questions of continental European philosophy over the past century. In this seminar course, designed for students with no previous background in philosophy, we will explore why meaning plays such a central role in all attempts to understand human consciousness, experience, behavior, and culoture, and how this insight has profoundly influenced major trends in contemporary thought. Starting with an introduction to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and the subsequent development of modern philosophic existentialism by critics of Husserl such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, we will examine the important influence of phenomenology and existentialism on contemporary trends in French, German, and American philosophy, including hermeneutics, deconstruction, post-modernism, cognitive science, and post-analytic philosophy, as exhibited in works by Paul Ricoeur, Hans Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, Richard Rorty, and others.",

In this introduction to metaphysics and epistemology, we will ask hard questions about the nature of reality and knowledge.

On the epistemology side, we will consider skeptical arguments, which purport to show that we can never know what's true, and we'll ask what's required for a belief to be justified, even it if fails to be knowledge. We may also explore other issues in contemporary epistemology, possibly including the role of probability in belief and formal epistemology, social aspects of belief-formation, and feminist epistemology.

The second half of the course examines contemporary problems, including: introspection and consciousness; philosophical foundations of cognitive science (computation vs. information); theories of the extended and embodied mind; methodological and conceptual problems in investigating the evolution of mind, brain, and culture; and the relation between neuroscience and psychology, using cases from particular areas such as attention and memory.

But of course the classic positions began to emerge as early as the pre-Socratic Greeks. The problem is not getting any easier. There are some fasinating solutions, to be sure. But there are no uncontroversial ones in sight. The aim of this seminar is to examine leading solutions to the mind-bodyproblem in light of their metaphysical credentials. In particular, the solutions will be considered in relation to theories of the nature of substance and properties in contemporary metaphysics. Most answers to the mind-body problem are claims about the nature of mental properties and mental substances, after all. The seminar will illustrate that certain leading approaches to the mind-body problem look quite different - in certain cases they are even incoherent-- once their metaphysical commitments are better understood. Philosophy of mind originally grew out ot metaphysics; we will approach the mind-body problem by piecing them back together. I shall see fit to rule out some customary solutions: we must discard non-reductive physicalism, together with a qualia-based property dualism that aspires to a physicalism about substance. These cannot be genuinely physicalist about substances, at least given the state of play in the domain of the metaphysics of substance. I will then construct what I believe to be more plausible, if neglected, solutions. Namely, I will develop a trope-based physicalism as well as a form of \"naturalistic substance dualism\"--one motivated by the irreducibility of phenomenal properties, in particular.",

Philosophers have been studying the mind for thousands of years, but the scientific findings resulting from cognitive science provide new opportunities to revise and adjudicate between theories. Across the disciplines of cognitive science it is widely agreed that the mind, like the turtle's shell or the bird's wings, is the product of evolution. But evolution seldom plays a central role in the development of theories about particular aspects of the mind. How can thinking about evolution help us reconcile theory with the results of key disciplines in cognitive science like psychology and the neurosciences? We'll take up this question by exploring the relationship between theory and experimental evidence in four core areas of cognitive science: perception, memory, rationality and morality. Students will be required to write two short essays and one exam.",

How is the notion of action related to what people do intentionally? To what they intend to do? In addressing these questions, we will devote particular attention to the influential writings of Elizabeth Anscombe and Donald Davidson. In this connection we will consider the relation of these questions to the classic dabate about whether reasons can be causes. As we shall see, Davidson transformed the theory of action with his suggestion that an event is an action just in case there is a true description of it under which it was someone's doing something for a reason.",

Central questions will be how Kant attempts to motivate or prove the fundamental value of freedom and the connection between this normative issue and his metaphysics of free will. Texts will include Kant's Lectures on Ethics, Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason, Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, and Metaphysics of Morals.

Yet on this realistic view, our perception is the result of a causal chain that leads from object to eye to brain to experiences, and we are only given the last element: the experience. So how do we really know how our experiences are caused, and where do we get the idea that they are casued by an external world of physical objects?

Although l ess well known today, the Stoics, in particular, were influential in the development of early Christian philosophy, and all three schools were highly influential in the development of early modern philosophy.

This course will deepen our understanding of the role that political and cultural ideologies -- such as liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, totalitarianism, fundamentalism, etc. -- play in these conflicts and the psychology of ideological thinking that makes them so difficult to resolve. We will begin by considering a series of case studies in contemporary political, social and cultural conflict, drawn from contemporary events such as the 2012 political campaigns, the 2011 debt ceiling debate in Congress, nationalist movements around the globe, etc. We will identify and examine the ideologies driving such conflicts, and from these we will draw out the common philosophical characteristics and psychological features of ideological thinking. Throughout, we will seek to understand the deep attraction of ideological commitments and why they tend to push public discourse and behavior to extremes and even violence. Finally, we will consider efforts to reduce or resolve ideological conflicts thorugh strategies of political compromise, dialogue, toleration, and democratic deliberation.",

    "course_description" : "This course offers an introduction to three major types of formal reasoning: deductive, inductive (probabilistic and statistical) and practical (also known as decision-making). First, and most centrally, we will be focusing on the logical structure of valid deductive arguments, i.e., arguments in which it is not possible for the conclusion to be false, given that the premises are all true. The pertinent argument-forms will be developed within the context of classical sentential and predicate logics with suitable extensions that include reasoning about various aspects of the world in terms of relations and functions. Our main objective in the deductive module is to expose students in a wide variety of contexts to the analysis of deductive arguments that includes appraising their correctness or incorrectness. Logical problem solving is used as a major pedagogic device. Next, we turn to correct inductive argument forms, i.e., arguments in which it is improbable that the conclusion be false, given that the premises are true. We present and study inductive arguments within the frameworks of elementary proability theory and statistics. Introduction of basic probabilistic and statistical concepts offers students the opportunity to extend deductive modes of reasoning to vastly more general forms of reasoning that rely on incomplete, limited, unreliable or uncertain information. We provide detailed examples that show how to analyze simple inductive argument-forms and illustrate what formal techniques are applicable in basic probabilistic and statistical problem solving. Additional examples are provided in the treatments of classical hypothesis testing and regression analysis. In the third and shortest module, we introduce some of the central ideas of (statistical) decision theory, without trying to treat the subject exhaustively that of course cannot be done in a single course. A decision problem usually has an objective to be attained and a collection of alternative choices with which to achieve it. The issue is then which choice will best achieve the specified objective. In this module we start with the most elementary decision-theoretic concepts, sketch some of the main principles of decision theory, and move gradually to the treatment of various unility-theoretic paradoxes and illustrative decision matrix examples. Finally, we indicate how reasoning based on optimization in decision theory arises also in game theory. The course is designed for students with a minimal background in mathematics.",

What is liberalism and which rights and institutions are essetial to it? Particular attention will be given to diffing accounts of property, the role of markets, and taxation in establishing distributive justice. Are rights of property natural and/or absolute, or is property a social convention that should be adjusted to meet social needs and circumstances? Are fair distributions of income and wealth grounded entirely in market exchanges and other consensual transfers? Or should distributions be arranged to meet some prior pattern of economic jsutice. Does government have a duty to provide public goods and to meet the basic needs of its members? What is the relationship between liberalism and democracy?

Some of the main topics to be considered include: how languagerelates to the world; what philosophy is and what it can accomplish; the nature of understanding; what is involved in following a rule; and the phenomenon of seeing-as. A distinctive feature of Wittgenstein's approach to philosoph is his commitment to philosophy as an activity rather than a set of doctrines. In keeping with this, the main goal of this class is for you to learn to do philosophy: to read closely, to grapple with foundational questions, and to talk seriously with others. This class is very much a seminar, and I will avoid lecturing as much as possible.",

Topics to be discussed include the following: specific object and method of economics as a social science; its relation with other disciplines (physics, psychology and evolutionary theory); values in economics (welfare, freedom, equality and neutrality); the role of understanding and possible limits of a quantitative approach to human behavior (purposefulness, freedom, creativity, innovation); prediction, unpredictability and the pretension of prediction; causation in econometrics and in economic theory (equilibrium); selfishness and utility maximization (cognitive and behaviorist interpretations); economic models and unrealistic assumptions (realism and instrumentalism); empirical basis of economics (observation and experiment); microeconomics and macroeconomics (reductionism and autonomy); pluralism in economics (mainstream economics and heterodox schools).",

The course begins with a consideration of Darwin's formulation of evolutionary theory and the main influences on Darwin. We will then consider two contemporary persentations of the theory of Richard Dawkins' and Richard Lewontin's. The remainder of the course will deal with a number offoundational issues and may include discussions of adaption, what constitutes a species, whether there is evolutionary progress, and the concept of fitness. We will also discuss the units of selection, the alleged reduction of classical genetics to molecluar genetics, and the possibility of gorunding ethics in evolutionary theory.

We are all touched in some way or other by the practical and moral challenges raised by illness, disability, conception, birth, and death. But, second, although the issues raised within bioethics are intensely personal and practical, they also reflect philosophical concerns taken up within ethical theory, such as questions about moral status, autonomy, truth-telling and justice. A central theme running throughout this course is the relationship between ethical theory, on the one hand, and the actual practices and experiences of facing choices about health and mortality, on the other. We will discuss a number of particular bioethical challenges faced by ordinary people, including abortion, treatment for severely disabled newborns, reproductive technology, confidentiality, informed consent, advance directives, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and distributive justice within the health care system. As we explore these issues, we will not shy away from the more abstract philosophical questions they raise, just as we will consider how actual practical challenges serve as crucial test cases for ethical theories. Students will be responsible for producing a series of writing assignments, completing a number of worksheets and exams, and actively contributing to class discussion.",

Theorists often treat these two questions as though they are theoretically interchangeable, but, as we shall see, there are good reasons to doubt that this is so. We will begin with Robert Paul Wolff's famous anarchist thesis that the state never has legitimate moral authority to govern, and, relatedly, that citizens never have a general obligation to obey the law. We will then examine a number of well-known theories that claim to show that, under certain circumstances, the state is capable of possessing at least partial moral authority to govern. We will look at, inter alia, A. John Simmons' version of the so-called principle of fair play, Joseph Raz's so-called service conception of authority, John Finnis \"natural law\" theory of political authority, Jeremy Waldron's version of John Rawls' theory of the duty to support just institutions, Thomas Christiano's theory of democratic political authority, Ronal Dworkin's theory of associative obligations, and various versions of consent theory. In addition to examining these specific theories, we will also inquire into the more abstract set of conditions that any theory of legitimate political authority or legitimate political obligation must meet if it is to have any change of being successful, either in whole or in part. In this regard, the work of Leslie Green and David Copp, among others, will prove particularly helpful.",

We will focus our attention on Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, but draw as well upon texts from other thinkers, particularly Elisabeth, Malebranche and Cavendish.

    "course_description" : "A study of some major texts in Ancient Greek Scepticsm. We will begin with Plato's Academy, more than a century after the death of its founder, when the head of the school Arcesilaus (315-240 BCE) advocates a turn away from \"doctrinal Platonism\" (that is, working out and defending the tenets of Plato's philosophy) and a return to the critical stance of Socrates in many Platonic dialogues, who advances no doctrines himself but criticizes the claims of others. Much of the intellectural activity of the so-called \"Sceptical Academy\" is directed at contesting the doctrines of their contemporaries in Hellenistic Athens: Stoic, Epicurean, and Peripatetic philosophers, with particular emphasis on the Stoic doctrine of the \"cognitive impression\", which the Stoics invoked as the foundation of all knowledge. Many of these debates are reported in Cicero's On Academic Scepticism, which is the first text we will study. By the late first century BCE, the Academy departed far enough from this \"skeptical stance\" that in reaction, the Academic Aenesidemus left that institution to found Pyrrhonism, which takes the fourth-century figure Pyrrho of Elis (360-270 BCE) as its symbolic figure head. The fullest account of Pyrrhonist Scepticism is in the writings of a 2nd century CE physician, Sextus Empirucus, whose Outlines of Pyrrhonism and Against the Ethicists will be the other major texts studied in this course. All readings will be in English translation. No knowledge of Greek or Latin is required.",

We will be taking a closer look at (a) his reflections associated with literary form, (b) his fundamental reflections on the relationship between literature and society, and (c) his specific interpretations of German literature--including his famous interpretations of Goethe, Hoelderlin, Eichendorff, and Hebbel. The course will be run as a seminar, with student presentations. Grades will be based on classroom participation and a term paper. Some prior experience with the history of modern philosophy will be expected, but background material will be available for students who have not previously taken a course on the Critique of Pure Reason.",

Indeed, almost every part of the 19th-century culture Marx put under his philosophical microscope has in one way or another vanished or been radically transformed: the state, the school, even sex have been fundamentally altered during a long 20th century filled with revolutions of culture. This class asks: is there a future for a philosopher whose political projects seem so precarious--if they have not failed outright-in the face of global capitalism? We will try to answer this question by examining the origins and the implications of Marx's writings, but also his complex legacy, from Lenin through Guevara to Foucault and Zizek. The course will conclude with a consideration of the role of the radical in today's global politics and cultural sphere.",

This course traces the origins of philosophy as a discipline in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece and Rome. We will examine how \"natural philosophers\" such as Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus distinguished their inquiries from the teachings of poets such as Homer and Hesiod; how ancient atomism had its origins in a response to Parmenides' challenge to the very assumption that things change in the world; how Socrates reoriented the focus of philosophy away from the natural world and toward the fundamental ethical question, \"how shall I live?\"; how his pupil Plato and subsequently Aristotle developed elaborate philosophical systems that address the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness. Finally, we will examine the ways in which later thinkers such as Epicureans, Stoics, and the neoPlatonists transformed and extended the earlier tradition.",

The first issue is how some early modern philosophers conceived of the relationship between God and world. In this section, we will look at various answers to the question: can we make sense of all aspects of the natural world without any appeal whatsoever to a God who created it? In the process of looking at various answers to this question, we'll also note the transformation of Western intellectual thought in this period, most notably, the slow separation of theology, metaphysics, and natural sciences into distinct disciplines. In this section, we will study texts of Descartes, Cavendish, Hume and Du Chatelet. The second issue is how some early modern philosophers think about the nature of human autonomy. In this section, we will look at different theories of human autonomy, including the impact upon such theories of the roles people play as a result of being members of families and other social groups. In this section, we return to Descartes and Cavendish before turning to the work of Astell and Kant. Of the six figures we will study, three are women whose works have long been under appreciated in the history of philosophy. And so throughout the course of the semester we will also be concerned with the meta-themes of canon formation and canon change.",

We will also study formal accounts of reasoning that subject arguments to rigorous mathematical analysis using truth tables and rules of natural deduction. We will also consider some meta-theoretical results about what we can be proven in formal systems. There will be lectures, demonstrations of problem-solving techniques, in-class and out-of-class work, and a variety of exercises.",

Students must have a permit to enroll in the course, and permits will be granted after a brief interview with the course instructor. The content of the course may include the following themes: uncoverning philosophical aspects of current movements in the USA to reform education (including philosophical aspects of Teach for America and the charter school movement); thinking about how much control over a child's education ought to be allocated to parents and how much to the state; considering what role, if any, religion ought to play in education; considering how race and gender impact individuals' educational experiences (and how such issues should be addressed in the classroom); thinking about what sort of (if any) civic education ought to be taught in schools; and considering how schools should be funded. We may also deal with more traditional themes in the philosophy of education such as the aims of education, the relation between theories of human nature and education, and the relation between theories of knowledge and education. Because this is an ABCS course, a significant element of the course is the community engagement element. Thus, the structure of the course is as follows. The Penn community (students and faculty) will meet every week on Tuesdays from 3:00-5:30 to discuss course readings and the community engagement portion of the course. Then, on every second Saturday from 11:00am to 12:30pm (we will meet every Saturday for the latter half of the term), the Penn community will meet with Philadelphia high school students to prepare the high school students to present their own original work on the philosophy of education at a conference to be held at Penn in May 2015. We will work as teams that will include 2 high school students and 2 Penn students, with the course instructors 'floating' among teams to provide guidance. Penn students will be assessed on their own written and other work for the course, and in no way on the written or oral work of the high school students.",

This project takes laws of nature, causation and dispositions as being non-fundamental. We will also strive to craft a fundamental ontology through considering the following issues: how contemporary physics informs metaphysics, whether there really is a meaningful physical/non-physical distinction, whether reality is informational, and the nature of mind and consciousness.

It examines the potential conflict between a mother's autonomy and an infant's prenatal harm in the larger context created by new kinds of parents and new forms of kinship.

There are no philosophy prerequisites, but participation in high school and/or college sthletics would be helpful. The central question to be answered is what constitutes cheating in sports, especially by methods that enhance athletic performance. Developing a framework to answer this question will take us through: 1) questions about rules: what is their point in sports and what are appropriate reasons to change them; 2) questions about the point of participation in a sport; 3) questions about the kinds of virtues sports participants can demonstrate; and 4) questions about integrity of participants and a sport itself. Answering these questions will help provide a principled basis for the kinds of performance enhancements (PEDs, technology and medical intervention) that are appropriate and inappropriate for athletes. A subsidiary question to be discussed is one about the nature of competition in sports: Is it essential to sports or only a means to an end? A related set of questions concerns the appropriate competitors in sporting events: (Why) should competition be restricted to single sex categories (and if so, what constitutes being a particular sex); (Why) should competition be divided into able bodied and handicapped categories?",

Experimental models in economics and psychology and whether they present a radical departure from traditional economic models; 3. Evolutionary models of the emergence of institutions, and agent-based simulations of such dynamics. In particular, we will explore theoretical and empirical models of trust, reciprocity, cooperation and fairness, asking what motivates individuals to engage in pro-social behavior and how such behavior can emerge and persist.

In exploring the origin and evolution of Nietzsche's key concepts, we will trace the ways in which his work has been variously revered or refuted, championed or co-opted, for more than a century. We will survey his broad influence on everything from philosophy and literature to music and art, theater and psychology, history and cultural theory, politics and popular culture. Further, we will ask how his ideas continue to challenge us today, though perhaps in unexpected ways. As we will see, Nietzsche wanted to teach us \"how to philosophize with a hammer.\"",

Proceeding chronologically, we will examine all of Nietzsche's major writings: from the early essays through the hopefulness of the 'free spirit' period, from the calculating genealogies to the inchoate and chaotic fragments of the posthumously published Will to Power, from the profoundly strange and terrifying Zarathustra to the fevered final works. Throughout the semester, students will be invited to consider Nietzsche's philosophical interitances (from, for instance, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer) and influences (on Heidegger, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida and many others). Discussion in English, but students are invited to read texts in the original where appropriate.",

    "course_description" : "Nationalism has been the most important geo-political phenomenon of the past two hundred years. Its continuing power has been amply demonstrated by recent events in many parts of the world. This seminar course will explore the ideology of nationalism, what it means, its philosophical foundations, underlying assumptions about the nature of human identity, moral implications, and political consequences. In the process, we will explore such questions as: What is a nation? Does every identifiable ethnic or national group have a valid claim to a nation-state of its own? How are claims to national self-determination justified? How do nations differ from states, peoples, groups, communities, and citizenries? How does nationalism relate to notions of \"chosenness\" or ethnic and cultural superiority? Why do nationalist movements seem to so often engender political extremism and violent ethno-political conflicts? Is national self-determination compatible with our commitments to individualism, rationality, and universal human rights?",

    "course_description" : "In this class we survey central philosophical issues in cognitive science. In particular, we explore what computational theories of the brain suggest concerning the traditional mind-body problem. We shall begin by examining key theories of the nature of consciousness. We shall then turn to the extended mind program, reading Andy Clark's *Natural Born Cyborgs*, and examining the program's plausibility in light of recent and anticipated work on brain-machine interfaces. We shall also consider the connectionist (neural network) approach to the computational basis of thought. After grasping the details of these approaches, we investigate the underlying metaphysical assumptions of computational theories of mind. Surprisingly, it is far from clear that computationalism about the brain entails a physicalist position about the nature of minds and their properties. This depends upon one's metaphysical assumptions about the nature of substance and properties. Intriguingly, according to the leading theories of substance, computationalism is *not* a physicalist position. But, this is all for the best, for as I urge, physicalism is an empty doctrine.",

We will organize the course around select themes and philosophical problems, such as rationality and knowledge, the nature of the self, reality and appearance, how to live well, how to do right by others, and what is the concept of justice. Do different traditions understand these problems in the same way? Can the positions and arguments of different philosophical traditions be compared and evaluated against each other, or are they fundamentally incommensurable? What can we learn from doing comparative philosophy concerning more practical matters like how to live our lives and how to do the right thing? Books and authors we read can include Descartes, Aristotle, Plato, Mill, Kant, Mencius, Confusius, and selections from the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.",
