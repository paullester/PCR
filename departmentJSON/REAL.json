Traditional course offerings are not always able to incorporate the most recent advances in the many areas that make up the field of real estate. In this course, the participants - both faculty and students - research and present current topics and recent advances in real estate. The content will vary depending on the participants' interests and areas of expertise, but will typically cover urban economics, spatial issues, the economics of housing and commercial real estate markets, and real estate finance and investment. This course is intended to expand students' awareness of current topics in real estate and to prepare them to conduct their own academic quality research. The proseminar is organized as a series of lectures by faculty and students on topics of their own choosing. These lectures may involve well-known areas of knowledge, research, and methodology, as well as subjects currently under study. The main course requirements are preparing and presenting a series of lectures on a real estate topic (subject to the organizing faculty member's approval) and writing a research proposal that describes a workable project building upon or extending one of the topics covered in the course.",

This course covers fundamental and cutting-edge topics in urban economics and real estate as well as the most important econometric issues that arise in the estimation of urban economics and real estate models. The first part of the course focuses on the application of modern econometric methods to analyze empirical questions in the broad urban economics field, which includes topics from public economics and local finances, such as household sorting and valuation of public goods. This part of the course is especially concerned about dealing with non-experimental data, and also provides a guide for tools that are useful for applied research. The second and third parts of the course examine the economic modeling and intuition of a range of topics in urban economics and real estate,such as spatial equilibrium, supply and demand of space, housing prices and cycles. In addition, special emphasis is given to how the understanding of economic theory and institutions can help any empirical analysis. At the end of the course students should have a firm grasp of theory and econometric tools that lead to convincing empirical applications. All PhD students will be expected to complete a research paper in addition to the successful completion of the course examination requirements.",

Practical examples will be extremely diverse and include the Silicon Valley and attempts to copy it, the Tennessee Valley Authority, housing retrictions in developing countries such as Brazil, congestion pricing in London, etc. Students will be expected to actively participate and make presentations. The course emphasizes the importance of the economic context, the understanding of the underlying rationale for policies, and how the private agents respond to public incentives. The main learning goals are the following: be able to use simple empirical tools of economic evaluations, be able to articulate a critical analysis of competing viewpoints and assessments, and be able to integrate various analytic steps into an overal assessment of economic policies that relies on sound principles and is well argued.",

We examine raw and developed land and the similarities and differences of traditional real estate product types including office, R & D, retail, warehouses, single family and multi-family residential, mixed use, and land as well as \"specialty\" uses like golf courses, assisted living, and fractional share ownership. Emphasis is on concise analysis and decision making. We discuss the development process with topics including market analysis, site acquisition, due diligence, zoning, entitlements, approvals, site planning, building design, construction, financing, leasing, and ongoing management and disposition. Special topics like workouts and running a development company are also discussed. Course lessons apply to all markets but the class discusses U.S. markets only. Throughout the course, we focus on risk management and leadership issues. Numerous guest lecturers who are leaders in the real estate industry participate in the learning process. Format: predominately case analysis and discussion, some lectures, project visits.",

Examples include: clusters and other local development initiatives, large scale regional policies, employment zones and other targeted policies. More traditional urban policies such as zoning and planning and constraints, transportation pricing, and parking policies among many others will also be considered. Practical examples will be extremely diverse and include the Silicon Valley and attempts to copy it, the Tennessee Valley Authority, housing retrictions in developing countries such as Brazil, congestion pricing in London, etc. Students will be expected to actively participate and make presentations. The course emphasizes the importance of the economic context, the understanding of the underlying rationale for policies, and how the private agents respond to public incentives. The main learning goals are the following: be able to use simple empirical tools of economic evaluations, be able to articulate a critical analysis of competing viewpoints and assessments, and be able to integrate various analytic steps into an overal assessment of economic policies that relies on sound principles and is well argued.",
