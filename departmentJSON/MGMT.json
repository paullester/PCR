    "course_description" : "This course explores the various modes of corporate development available to managers to drive firm growth and change, including alliances, outsourcing, corporate venturing, and particularly mergers and acquisitions. The objectives are three-fold: (1) to arm you with a set of tools to facilitate the selection of the appropriate growth strategy in a given situation; (2) to provide you with insights as to how to manage partnerships like alliances, outsourcing, and corporate venturing; and, (3) to develop a comprehensive framework for executing M&As, from initiation to implementation. The emphasis is on strategic and operational aspects of these transactions, rather than financial considerations. We begin by examining the different modes of corporate development, including the applicability and management approaches for each, particularly various types of partnerships. We then delve into acquisition screening and deal-making. Afterwards, we consider in detail post-merger integration. The course ends with the presentation of project work and a review of the course learnings. In terms of its pedagogical approach, this is designed to be an interactive, applied, case-based course with accompanying conceptual readings to help structure your thinking. Given the nature of the course, we will also apply the lessons from the cases to understand the challenges and implications of relevant recent and on-going deals. In addition, guest speakers with experience in investment banking, consulting, and industry will be invited to share their perspectives. A semester-long group project is intended to give you the opportunity to apply your learning from the course to a context that is most interesting and relevant to you.",

Accordingly managers may not undertake desirable value or wealth maximizing strategies. The course examines the governance of firms including the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. It examines how the corporate governance, compensation and incentive systems can mitigate agency problems that are inherent in organizations.",

    "course_description" : "This course examines some of the central questions in management with economic approaches as a starting point, but with an eye to links to behavioral perspectives on these same questions. It is not a substitute for a traditional microeconomics course. Economics concerns itself with goal directed behavior of individuals interacting in a competitive context. We adopt that general orientation but recognize that goal directed action need not take the form of maximizing behavior and that competitive processes do not typically equilibrate instantaneously. The substantive focus is on the firm as a productive entity. Among the sorts of questions we explore are the following: What underlies a firms capabilities? How does individual knowledge aggregate to form collective capabilities? What do these perspectives on firms say about the scope of a firms activities, both horizontally (diversification) and vertically (buy-supply relationships)? We also explore what our understanding of firms says about market dynamics and industry evolution, particularly in the context of technological change. A central property of firms, as with any organization, is the interdependent nature of activity within them. Thus, understanding firms as \"systems\" is quite important Among the issues we explore in this regard are the following. Organizational \"systems\" have internal structure, in particular elements of hierarchy and modularity. Even putting aside the question of individual goals and objectives and how they may aggregate, the question of organizational goal is non-trivial. To say that a firms objective is to maximize profits is not terribly opera tional. How does such an overarching objective get decomposed to link to the actual operating activities of individual subunits, including individuals themselves. This issue of goals has links to some interesting recent work that links the valuation process of financial markets to firm behavior. Financial markets are not only a reflection of firm value, but may guide firms initiatives in sys tematic ways.",

Development of the tools of game theory and the application of those tools is emphasized. Game theory has become an important tool for managers and consultants in analyzing and implementing tactical as well as strategic actions. This course will primarily focus on examples useful for developing competitive strategy in the private sector (pricing and product strategy, capacity choices, contracting and negotiating, signaling and bluffing, takeover strategy, etc.). Game theory can also be used to address problems relevant to a firm's organizational strategy (e.g., internal incentives and information flow within a firm) and to a firm's non-market environment (e.g., strategic trade policies, litigation and regulation strategy).",

The organizations we will examine may be nominally \"for-profit\", \"not-for-profit\" or NGOs, but what they share is commitment both to a social impact mission and to a set of disciplined, sophisticated financial and management practices. They are led by individuals who themselves are both committed to the mission of the enterprise and who recognize the importance of demonstrably effective business models. And in the mix is the role of innovation, of developing new approaches, new models, and/or new technologies in service of better realizing the social mission.",

The purpose of this course is to explore the many dimensions of new venture creation and growth and to foster innovation and new business formations in independent and corporate settings. The course addresses both a theoretical perspective on venture initiation and the application of writing an actual business plan. In this course you are asked to get out of the habit of being a receiver of ideas, facts, concepts and techniques, and get into the habit of generating ideas, identifying problems, analyzing and evaluation alternatives, and formulating workable action plans, thus putting textbook knowledge into practice. Students will get this hands-on experience in the following ways: through the formation and ongoing work of venture teams that will design a comprehensive business development plan for a particular start-up company. Teams are expected to utilize the tools and analytical approaches discussed in class to their venture. Through lectures and class discussions that are designed to familiarize students with the many dimensions of entrepreneurship and new venture initiation. Class format varies throughout the course: in some class sessions, there will be a lecture on specific topics; other sessions wil consist of case discussions of a particular topic or a discussion of the business concepts that students are developing; guest speakers also lead and participate in some class sessions.",

The course is motivated by rapid increases in both the supply of and demand for private equity over the past two decades. The topic is addressed from two distinct perspectives: issues that relate to the demand for private equity and venture capital (the entrepreneur's perspective) on the one hand, and issues that relate to the supply of capital (the investor's perspective) on the other. As well, we will address management issues that relate to how the VC and the entrepreneur work together once an investment has been made, compensation issues, and governance issues in the privately held venture capital backed company. Format: Case/discussion format, supplemented by lectures and guest speakers. Requirements: Classroom participation, written case assignments, late midterm. Materials: Required coursepack and supplemental recommended reading.",

To do so, we will cover a blend of classic and contemporary literature so that we can appreciate the prevailing theories and findings in various areas of micro-organizational behavior. In addition, for each topic we will then try to go beyond the existing literature. We will work to increase our understanding by re-framing the research varibales, altering the perspective, bringing in new theory, and comparing levels of analysis. Building on the topics we examined in MGMT 951, we will explore further organizational behavior topics including identity, fit, extra role behaviors, job design, creativity, status, power and influence.",

The course is consciously interdisciplinary in its design and is focused on a central phenomenon: internationalinvestors' attempts to overcome political and social challenges that stand between market demand and shareholder profit. The course is built around the assumption that as international investment involves individual working in teams in multiple organizations from various countries motivated by some combination of self-interest, profit and public interest, an interdisciplinary perspective in which one genuinely integrates insights and tools from economics, political science, international business and strategy will outperform a narrower approach. While our main focus will be oncorporate diplomacy in a global business environment, the topics we will examine are generalizable to many additional contexts including team decision-making, organizational politics, lobbying, marketing, sales, political campaigns and corporate, national or multilateral projections of soft power.",

The core idea is that leadership is about making a difference in all aspects of one's life; this course offers students the opportunity to practice the skills needed to do so, now and in the future. Students learn and apply key leadership principles and actively explore what it means for them to be real (to act with authenticity by clarifying what's important), to be whole (to act with integrity by respecting the whole person), and to be innovative (to act with creativity by experimenting with how things get done).

    "course_description" : "One of the challenging aspects of MBA curricula is that students are taught various techniques in each function as well as what determines success in that function but not how to manage trade-offs among those different goals and the different techniques for achieving them. This is especially true in the contextof the workforce. It is possible, for example, to organize tasks and work schedules in ways that should maximize efficiency if systems all operated correctly and individuals are rational. Yet we know that pursuing those objectives too far can lead in practice to high levels of stress and alienationamong workers that causes performance suffers. We can motivate employees power-fully with financial incentives, but we rarely know in advance how far to push those incentives before they are no longer cost-effective. The purpose of this class is to understand those trade-offs and to give stu- dents a practical sense as to when they matter in terms of overall firm or organizational performance. The way we propose to do this is throug computer- based simulations. The simulations give participants options then show them theconsequences of their decisions for overall firm performance. In contrast to other pedagogy, the goal of these simulations is not to show us the best systems. It is to show how the choices among practices matter. A noval feature of this course is that we use simulations from real organizations that include those that most students would otherwise never see, such as managing the operating staff in a nuclear control room or running a MacDonald's store. Each simulation focuses on a different aspect of managing, focused on the human capital issues. Assesments for the course will be based on class participation,performance in each simulation, and write-ups describing lessons learned.",

Using a range of theoretical and business articles, cases, exercises, assesments, and simulations, we will extract a variety of lessons about power and politics in organizations. Topics include political skill, influence, issue selling, change management, networks, hierarchy, political conflict, corruption, coping with intolerable bosses, speaking up, redemption, and downsizing.",

The course is designed with several key components, these are: conceptual and practical readings relevant to the topic; case studies illustratng key concepts and issues; lecture on practical application and examples; and lastly every class will also feature a presentation by and conversation with an outside expert whose work is relevant to guiding or advising start-ups and fast-growing small firms. We will focus on the following objectives: identifying the talent needed to initiate and sustain an entrepreneurial endeavor; structuring human resource policies and corporate culture to prepare for and facilitate firm growth; assessing the human aspects of valuing entrepreneurial companies; and responding to conflict and organizational threats within nascent firms. This course will apply recent research from strategic human resource management, personnel economics and organizational behavior to the practical issues of building and managing human assets in new ventures.

Coupled with growing awareness of these issues is the emerging sense that traditional government programs and charities may be unable to solve these problems - at least, not alone. What may be needed are new strategies - strategies borne of (a) a deep understanding of the issues; (b) interdisciplinary collaboration; and (c) access to business knowledge, frameworks, and resources. This course is designed to provide the information, strategies, examples, and analytical mindset to make students more rigorous, insightful, and effective in analyzing social ills and crafting potential solutions. Together, a cross-disciplinary group of undergraduate students, including students in Wharton, the College, and other Penn Schools, will examine the nature and extent of two pressing social problems - food insecurity and barriers to post-secondary education - and current approaches to solving these problems. After an introduction to the social impact landscape and review of frameworks and tools for social impact, we will meet with researchers, business leaders, and non-profit leaders to learn what's not working, what is working, and what might work even better.",

The course provides many occasions to strengthen your ability to exercise leadership through service, to speak and write persuasively, and to work collaboratively with a diverse group of individuals. Through the course of the term, you will have a heightened sense of your individual strengths and opportunities for growth. Eleven sections of approximately 60 students are scheduled each year (nine in the fall; two in the spring). Attached to each section are six recitations. Your recitation determines your project team. Whether you are in lecture participating in role plays or simulations, in recitation doing impromptu speeches, or out in the field working on your project, Management 100 is highly interative and participative. The hallmark of the course is experiential learning. Over the course of the year, Management 100 teams complete nearly 70 field projects. In the fall, freshmen participate in community service projects, a good number supplied by the United Way; in the spring, upper level transfer and dual degree students work on consulting projects vetted by Wharton's Small Business Development Center (SBDC).",

The redefinition of boundaries between the public and private sectors creates new roles and opportunities for policymakers and business people. This course will review the international experience with privatization -- the Thatcher privatizations of the 1980s, the sale of industries and utilities in developing countries, the transformation from central planning in post-Communist countries, and the recent experiences with privatizing very traditional public services and infrastructure activities by local and national governments throughout the world. What practical lessons can be learned from the myriad of methods adopted in different countries? What issues arise in privatization transactions and what are the implications for business and regulatory policy? Who gains and who loses from privatization and how can deals be structured that improve productivity and welfare? These questions will be addressed through lectures, guest speakers, case studies and simulations.  Inactive",

Today's alliances drive corporate growth and change, and vary greatly in terms of partner type, commitment, equity investment, degree of control, between scale, and scope. They range from bilateral arrangements to ecosystems to outsourcing, often blurring traditional organizational boundaries and leading to the creation of globally distributed enterprises. In view of these contemporary developments, the objectives of the course are two-fold: (1) to arm you with a set of tools to facilitate the selection of an appropriate alliance strategy in a given situation; and, (2) to provide you with frameworks to help the initiate and implement different kinds of partnerships. The emphasis lies on strategic and organizational aspects in the formation and management of these transactions, rather than financial considerations. Alternative growth strategies to strategic alliances (e.g., acquisitions), the impact of these partnerships on competition within an industry, and regulatory constraints will also be discussed. In terms of its pedagogical approach, this is designed to be an interactive, applied, case-based course with accompanying conceptual readings to help structure your thinking. Given the nature of the course, we will also apply the lessons from the cases to understand the challenges and implications of relevant recent and on-going deals. In addition, guest speakers with experience in investment banking, consulting, and industry will be invited to share their perspectives. A group project is intended to give you the opportunity to apply your learning from the course to a context that is most interesting and relevant to you.",

    "course_description" : "This course concerns the history of capitalism in America viewed from the perspective of the people who operated (and in some cases owned) the firms. Its focus is on the activities of value creation and value capture and on how evolving opportunities and selection pressures have conditioned the historic development of competition, strategic analysis and initiatives, organizational structures, merger-and-acquisition activity, entrepreneurship, and the like. Accounting and control are also part of the story: the course in fact considers issues arising in a variety of different management disciplines and shows off their interrelationships. The maintenance (or otherwise) of value capture over the cycle and over time is a running theme. The course has a narrative element (running from Franklin's days through the early twenty-first century) but its deeper purpose is to give students some idea of how to think about the future evolution of firms and industries. It proceeds through a consideration of actual business decisions and performance in a series of challenging and otherwise interesting moments in the evolution of the American business environment. The materials are unusual for the Wharton School--they are often case-like and when possible draw on documents contemporary to the decisions such as correspondence, memoranda, minutes of meetings, old newspaper and magazine stories, and eyewitness accounts. They require thoughtful preparation. This course is much more focused on the students than many and a successful experience of its demands that the students both engage with the materials and take an active role in the class discussion. The largest single element in the grading is a substantial term paper on a topic agreeable to both the student and the instructor. For more information, please contact the instructor: raff@wharton.upenn.edu.",

To meet these course objectives, the emphasis will be on learning powerful ideas about how to be systematic in strategy implementation efforts, making use of research about case problems, class discussions, in class exercises, and student presentations. Much of the learning will take place in group discussions outside the classroom in preparation for the time we meet in the classroom.",

    "course_description" : "The management of emerging enterprises - new, small, entrepreneurial organizations - creates a range of multi-faceted challenges for the entrepreneur, whether the founder (and founding team) or the first generation of management. Establishing an emerging organization's unique business model or value proposition (not to mention its survival) is often the overriding preoccupation, but even in a new, small organization, managers need to under- stand how to develop the internal workings of a new firm, how to assess and create a strategy, and how to take into account ever-increasing globalization. While these issues are distinct, they are very much intertwined. As a result, this course will provide you with an integrated view of these challenges and show you that successful management in the 21st century requires a combination of insights drawn from economics, sociology, psychology and political economy. The course has three main parts. The first major part of the course will deal with fundamental issues of strategy, examining issues central to the long- and short-term competitive position of an enterprise. The second part of the course stresses the fact that organizational life is built around a complex interplay of social forces. We will study how to develop and implement organizational designs and human resource systems that achieve competitive advantage through the management of people. The third part of the course stresses the deep and persistent cross-national differences in economic, political and social institutions that affect the strategy, social structure, performance and value of organizations. The course culminates in the Wharton Global Summit when we examine the general management challenges posed by a current crisis (e.g., Euro 2013?) or in a rapidly growing frontier market (e.g., Imbalances in China).",

    "course_description" : "Family firms differ in a number of ways from non-family firms. These differences may result in differential behavior by and performance of family firms versus non-family firms. Although family-controlled firms make up the vast majority of businesses around the world, academic research in this space is sparse. This seminar seeks to expose students to theoretical and empirical perspectives on family businesses. Throughout the course, we will focus on the ownership, control, and management issues that set family firms apart. We will focus on the main issues faced by family firms, and attempt to critically examine how, using a range of methodologies, researchers have approached these issues. As we review the literature, we will seek to identify promising research areas, which may be of interest to you in the context of your dissertation research. In addition to addressing the content of the received literature, we will examine the process of crafting research papers and getting them published in top tier journals. Towards that end, we will characterize the key elements of high-impact papers and review the development process of such studies. Students are expected to come fully prepared to discuss and critique the readings that are assigned to each class (see details below). Each class will center on discussing in depth 4-5 papers from the reading list assigned to that class. Before each class, I will let you know which papers to prepare. Each student will serve as the discussion leader for one of more of the class sessions. Discussion leaders are expected to critically review several articles, identify new insights in the research that is being reviewed and evaluate its contribution to the literature, position the articles within the literature on the subject matter, raise discussion questions, and act as the discussion moderator for thclass session. Each discussion leader is asked to prepare a one or two page summary of the assigned papers which includes a statement of the main research question(s), the methodology, data set if any, summary of findings, a commentary with your thoughts on the reading, and proposed discussion questions. Prior to each class, the discussion leader will meet the instructor to help plan the class meeting. Towards the end of each class, each student will be asked to articulate a research question that emerged from thesession and describe the research design used to investigate the issue.",

This approach generates societal wealth as well as entrepreneurial wealth. The course is distinguished from public sector initiatives to address social problems. Student teams are expected to develop a plan to launch a social enterprise. The teams will also generate presentations of two proposals focused on the identification of opportunities for large established firms to create a bottom of the pyramid business that will significantly boost social wealth in a target country.

Students will assess these differences that heighten the risks for private equity investors in emerging markets and explore how they can be successfully mitigated. The course will be analytically rigorous and require a high level of weekly preparation and class participation. The case method of teaching will predominate, allowing students to gain a realistic understanding of the roles, responsibilities and analytical skills required of practitioners, and the tensions that arise between the various stakeholders, including government officials who formulate regulations and policies that affect PE investor behavior and performance. Cases will highlight the challenges and tasks performed at each stage of the investment cycle, such as structuring a new fund, originating investment opportunities, conducting due diligence, monitoring and creating value in portfolio companies, and exiting.",

    "course_description" : "This course focuses on the role of professionals, including lawyers of all types (corporate, tax, securities, etc.), direct private equity investors, corporate business development officers, and investment bankers, in creating value through transaction engineering. The overall goal of the course is to explain how private parties order their commercial interactions, to develop a theory of how they ought to do this, and to gain a thorough understanding of how business deals are actually done. The first half of the course will be devoted to impediments to transacting, including asymmetric information, difficulties intrinsic to contracting over time, enforceability, and various forms of strategic behavior, and to a variety of possible responses rooted in decision theory, option theory, risk management, and incentive alignment. In this first part, student teams also will follow the development of some current deals and give brief in-class presentations about them. In the second half of the course, (differently composed) student teams will apply the tools developed in the first half to the fine details of a series of real transactions. Each team will be assigned to a recently completed transaction and given access to the original documents implementing their deal. Each deal will get three classes. In the first, the instructors will present some background. In the second, the student teams will present their transaction to the class, focusing on how the transaction was structured and the advantages and disadvantages of that structure. In the third session, one or more of the parties who worked on the transaction will present the deal from the participant perspective and take questions from the class. The requirements for the class are regular attendance, active participation in class discussions, and completion of some homework assignments, the two group projects, and an individual paper. The course meets jointly with an upper-class Law School and LLM course. Wharton enrollment will be restricted this year to 25 MBA students. In the event that the course is oversubscribed, students will be admitted from the waiting list only if other students drop the course. If this happens, it usually happens fairly early on. Priority for admission in these circumstances will go to students who have attended the class from the beginning.",

This course provides students with an opportunity to conduct in-depth analysis of Chinese firms and the complex business environment that they represent. Instead of describing what is happening in China, which is futile given its fast pace of change, we will tackle the fundamental global strategy questions based on the deep-rooted political, economic, and cultural forces there. We will use a combination of lectures, cases, and debates in class. The purpose is not to memorize the facts about China, but to develop the analytical skills and a global mindset that allow you to understand the nuances behind conducting business in China -- and in emerging markets in general.",

But beyond discovering ways to extend your own power, influence and political skill in organizations, we will also uncover lessons about ways in which power and politics can blind you, and how to navigate situations in which you are up against powerful people. Using a range of theoretical and business articles, cases, exercises, assessments and simulations, we will extract a variety of lessons about power and politics in organizations. Topics include political skill, influence, issue selling, change management, networks, hierarchy, political conflict, corruption, coping with intolerable bosses, speaking up, redemption, and downsizing.",

In other words, serious players are well calibrated (skilled at distinguishing what they know from what they don't). This course gives you chances to explore how well calibrated you are in a low-risk setting. The course should appeal to students with interests in strategy, international business, political-risk analysis, and the managerial challenges of maximizing the judgmental accuracy of key personnel. The class will pit its wits against competitors in a global-forecasting tournament sponsored by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA) - as well as design forecasting exercises around your individual career and business plans. Key challenges include: (a) learning to translate \"interesting questions\" into \"testable propositions,\" (b) getting into the habit of translating vague hunches into probability metrics and making good use of feedback on how well calibrated you are, (c) applying tools for enhancing accuracy, (d) making solo forecasts - and exploring methods of making team forecast more than the sum of their individual-contributor parts.",

The preference is for them to begin the course with already conceived ideas for entrepreneurial solutions to social problems. They may also join a team to work on a project proposed by a student who already has a business idea.

    "course_description" : "This course concerns the history of capitalism in America viewed from the perspective of the people who operated (and in some cases owned) the firms. Its focus is on the activities of value creation and value capture and on how evolving opportunities and selection pressures have conditioned the historic development of competition, strategic analysis and initiatives, organizational structures, merger-and-acquisition activity, entrepreneurship, and the like. Accounting and control are also part of the story: the course in fact considers issues arising in a variety of different management disciplines and shows off their interrelationships. The maintenance (or otherwise) of value capture over the cycle and over time is a running theme. The course has a narrative element (running from Franklin's days through the early twenty-first century) but its deeper purpose is to give students some idea of how to think about the future evolution of firms and industries. It proceeds through a consideration of actual business decisions and performance in a series of challenging and otherwise interesting moments in the evolution of the American business environment. The materials are unusual for the Wharton School--they are often case-like and when possible draw on documents contemporary to the decisions such as correspondence, memoranda, minutes of meetings, old newspaper and magazine stories, and eyewitness accounts. They require thoughtful preparation. This course is much more focused on the students than many and a successful experience of its demands that the students both engage with the materials and take an active role in the class discussion. The largest single element in the grading is a substantial term paper on a topic agreeable to both the student and the instructor.
