Participants will explore a range of practitioner inquiry traditions and texts that go by terms such as action, collaborative, critical, community-based, participatory, autobiographical, emancipatory, narrative and pedagogical. They will also conduct an inquiry based on their particular interests and contexts. The course will emphasize practitioner inquiry that intentionally engages issues of equity, access and culture in educational settings.",

It also invites participants to engage the notion that knowledge for teaching and research comes from inquiry into the questions, issues, and contradictions that arise from everyday life.

Students will focus on one or more students to conduct a comprehensive child study of the child in context. This contact must include opportunities to observe children in a natural setting and interact with them on a regular basis throughtout the semester.

In particular, we focus on how discipline becomes the expression of twin but conflicting premises of education: that children should be encouraged to develop their critical intellectual capacities and autonomous decision-making -- read freedom; that these ends cannot be achieved without the direction and control of teachers -- read authority. Students read classical works on freedom and authority (John Stuart Mill, Isaiah Berlin, Emile Durkheim, John Dewey, C.S.Lewis) as well as more contemporary ones. In class we look at video clips of different practices and discuss readings. Every student selects one type of disciplinary approach to study in detail, inclusive of on-site visits. The seminar paper covers the source and nature of the school's commitments, its theory of authority and freedom (implicit and explicit), illustrations of how commitments are expressed (including discipline practices), and the student's reflections.",

This course is intended to develop a cadre of teacher leaders in chemistry. The curriculum will address the particular needs of the students and the standards of the school district. The goal is to implement a curriculum that will lead to substantial improvement in the achievement of high school students. The students will identify from the literature the best practices that are likely to be salient in the conditions in which they teach and adopt these in an effort to attain rigorous standards. They will explore their roles within the school and district as agents of systemic reform and will endeavor to build a local community to sustain high quality teaching and learning.",

The course themes include causal inference, vulnerability of models applied to observational data, recent developments computer-intensive inductive approaches to data, and related matters. Although some methodological background papers will be discussed, the seminar is case study oriented with readings from contemporary research on the topics from peer reviewed journals and well-vetted reports issued by governmental and nongovernment agencies. Cases will include work supported by IES on effects of Odyssey Math, for example, and work in the crime and justice arena. We will study the work of scholars affiliated with Penn who are actively involved in randomized and non-randomized trials, for instance, and the work of colleagues at other universities (Berkeley, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Princeton, others) and colleagues in non-profit and for profit research organizations such as Analytica, AIR, Mathematica and others that contribute tolearning in this arena. Colleagues who have contributed notably to contemporary trials and related topics, and whose work we study, will be invited to present guest lectures. Seminar participants are required to read relevant papers prior to the presentations.The coure is open to graduate students who have had basic statistics courses at the graduate level, and have a strong interest in evidence based policy and in studies that transcend discipline boundaries.",

The website for the virtual museum was first expanded and updated during hte fall of 2010 by students in an Academically Based Community Service course taught by Professor Walter Licht of the History Department and Mark Lloyd. To be offered as an ABCS course in Fall 2014, it will continue the work of developing the virutal history museum. Students will engage in research projects that contribute to one or more of the following categories: a general history of West Philadelphia, accounts of its neighborhoods and their institutions, a historical economic narrative of the area, a re-photographic survey of area landmarks, and the further collecting and posting to the website of personal and family stories.",

How much, if any control over education can be allocated to the state, even when this conflicts with the educational goals parents have for their children? Such questions are especially relevant in multicultural or pluralistic societies in which some groups within a liberal state are non-liberal.

The issue of financial sustainability focuses on the need of schools to carefully manage funding sources and expenditures and raise supplemental dollars to underwrite aspects of the mission of the school. Included in this focus will be the topics of marketing, communications, and development. 2. Environmental sustainability is increasingly emphasized by schools as an educational goal and an operating principal. This topic will include incorporating sustainability practices into school wide decision making to build campuses which are increasingly green and less wasteful. 3. The third and final focus of the course, programmatic sustainability, brings together many of the themes of the entire leadership program as it reviews the ways schools must think about new models of educating children including the implications of such issues as emerging research on learning, environmental sustainability, globalization, and equity and access. The course utilizes the conceptual framework for sustainability developed by the National Association of Independent Schools. Offered within the School Leadership Program.",

The course will include examination of several practice programs developed from the theoretical framework to provide services to parents, children, and school staff, including pairs therapy for the development of relationship skills and understandings; a whole-class prevention program to build social-emotional and academic skills in elementary children; and a preventive intervention to build capacity in Head Start to engage parents facing adversities such as degression. The practice-oriented elements of the course will also address the partnership process itself. We will consider tools and strategies for conducting needs assessments and gaining entry into schools as an outside community member, and developing documentation and evaluation measures to gather clinical information as well as to assess program effectiveness. At all times, the course will hold the multiple perspectives of the individual child and the systems around the child, with the goal of having students understand individual interventions in the context of institutional relationships and systemic change. This course will focus primarily upon work in schools grades pre-k through 8, but will consider issues and strategies relevant to high schools as well.",

Given the diversity of clients that counselors see professionally, some advanced and demonstrated knowledge of how cultural differences will be addressed in the counseling session and in the relationships of larger societal institutions will be expected.

By engaging with youth, in various texts and contexts and for a range of purposes, participants will try to make sense of how adolescents negotiate their worlds, in school and out. The approach to literacy is interdisciplinary, drawing from the domains of literature, composition, linquistics, curriculum theory, anthropology and psychology and from theory, research and practice of both university-based and school-based teachers, writers and researchers. The intent is to pose and refine questions about what it means to teach literacy in ways that take seriously what youth bring to school as their own knowledge and passions, cultural and linguistic resources.",
