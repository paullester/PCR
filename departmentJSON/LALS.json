We will examine how U.S.- American race relations shape Latino/a notions and contructions of race in these texts and how the authors' connections with Latin America and the Caribbean do the same. In order to understandxc these constructions from a hemispheric perspective, we will juxtapose our reading of Latina/o texts with works by Latin American writers that address similar issues but in a Latin American context. All coursework and discussions are in English.",

This course also touches upon other important aspects critical to understanding early modern Spain: relationships among Christians, Muslims, and Jews in the Iberian Peninsula; the conquest and colonization of the New World; and early modern debates about Spain's rights to occupy America and the so-called \"destruction of the Indies.\"",

We will focus on how belonging and participation have been defined in particular locales, as well as how these notions have been socialized through a variety of institutional contexts. Finally, we will consider the relationships between popular culture and state formation, examining these as dialectical struggles for hegemony.",

    "course_description" : "Are decentralization reforms fostering local community participation and improving the quality of democracy in Latin America? Are they, insted, posing a threat to democracy and development? In the last thirty years, Latin Ameican countries have undergone major reforms that devolved fiscal resources, administrative responsibilities, and political authority from the central governments to the states and municipalities. These decentralization reforms have radically altered the political landscape in Latin America, even inthe countries that have since then tried to recentralize power, such as Venezuela. What were the main causes of the decentralization movement? Who were the main national and international actors who pushed forward these reforms? What have the main political, fiscal, and policy consequences of decentralization been? These are some of the questions this course will focus on. The experiences of decentralization in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Mexico will be studied. Although prior knowledge of Latin American politics is not required, additional readings will be assigned to the students who have not taken at least one introductory course in Latin American politics, history or cultures.",

The course is not a chronological journey, but rather a topical treatment of the various issues in the history of American music. Some of the specific, project-oriented activities of the course will consist of, but will not be limited to the following: (1)participating in the development of a traveling exhibition on the Apollo Theater for the SmithsonianInstitution; (2)development of a permanent website for a history of jazz course at Penn; (3)reviewing two manuscripts for publication to a major press; (4)developing a working proposal for a history of African American music. In this context students will learn the basics of contemporary music criticism, including: identifying a work's significant musical gestures; positioning those gestures within a broader field of musical rhetoric, conventions, and social contracts; and theorizing the conventions with respect to large systems of cultural knowledge, such as historical, geographical contexts as well as the lived experiences of audiences, composers, performers, and dancers. Other topics covered: origin and development of American popular music and gendered and racial aspects of American classical music.",

To finish, we tackle specific issues in democratization such as social capital and civic participation, as well as the resilience of (subnational) authoritarianism.",

As a region in which there have been massive transplantations of peoples and their cultures from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and upon which the United States has exerted considerable influence, we will quesiton the processes by which the meeting and mixing of peoples and cultures has occurred. Course readings include material on the political economy of slavery and the plantation system, family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies, popular culture, and the differing ways national, ethnic, and racial identities are expressed on the islands and throughout the Caribbean diaspora.",

Caribbean musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics, ritual, communication, religion, and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Caribbean contexts <-concepts such as post-colonialism, migration, ethnicity, hybridity, syncretism, and globalization. Each of these concepts, moreover, will be explored with a view toward understanding its connections to the central analytical paradigm of the course <- diaspora. Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music, ranging from calypso to junkanoo, from rumba to merengue, and from dancehall to zouk. We will then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relations to our own North-American contexts of music consuption and production.",

In this course we look at how outsiders have characterized some of the indigenous groups of North, Central and South America, from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. We will compare various strategies of conquest and control devised by English, Spanish and other European conquerors and their later counterparts. Using historical and anthropological sources as well as literature, film and other visual depictions, we will analyze some of the legal, ontological, moral and philosophical frameworks devised to describe and categorize Indians. We will examine the present-day legacies of cultural differences among indigenous people as well as among their conquerors, and attend to the ways Indians have used new technologies and strategies to represent themselves.",

And yet, the historical memory of cities is also made legible through modes of cultural expression and inscription - including literature, visual art, graffiti, music, and street performance. Cycles of urban de-industrialization and renewal since the 1970s, as well as legacies of conflict and inequality, have exacerbated the need for alternate forms of commemoration. The Occupy movement is one continued example of how urban space can be reanimated through demarcation, embodiment, and calls for collectivity.",

Our journey will include in the Caribbean, where we will spend some time thinking about merengue and rake-n-scrape music. Throughout the semester, the musical case studies will be matched by readings and films that afford ample opportunity to think about the ways that music is bound up in ethnicity, identity, and class.

Lectures and reading assignments will draw upon a variety of sources, including court cases, artistic renderings, city maps and street plans, travel accounts of visits to the regions, and the material, cultural, and intellectual products made possible by the wealth and dynamism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will conclude with an analysis of the Age of Revolutions, a period of dramatic upheaval that remains at the center of lively scholarly debates. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage the key questions driving these debates, the most important of which, perhaps, is: what is Latin America's colonial legacy?",

However, if we explore the conditions surrounding their employment, we see that globally, women in these occupations share some very important characteristics. These include similar household status, similar economic motivation and financial goals, and, similar placement on the occupational ladder. Many domestic and factory workers are also migrants, an although they are often better educated than women of previous generations, the vast majority are underemployed. This course examines how new forms of production and the spread of global capitalism have impacted the lives of women. The course will also examine and critique previous and current theoretical constructs that have attempted to describe and explain the phenomenon. By also evaluating women in relation to their country or region of origin, we will compare how global economic, social, and political forces have created new and renewed forms of womens oppression. Through group projects and individual projects, we will research and evaluate the condition of women engaged in domestic and factory labor, and look at how past, present and future global conditions affect women associated with and employed in these categories of work.",

We will survey the histories of the many Mexican American people who might (or might not) consider themselves Chicano from the Mexican American War to the Zoot Suit Riots, from El Plan Espiritual de Aztl?n to Selena. The class will also explore issues of ethnicity, immigration past and present, class and gender differences, cultural conflict and exchange, transnational economies and identities, popular cultural images and production, family life and community building, struggles for equality, the relationship of Mexican Americans to Latino/as, and the controversies raised by the emergence of an increasingly multi-ethnic, multilingual society.",

Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music and then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relation to our own, North American contexts of music consumption and production.",

Through readings of primary and secondary texts we will discuss the cultural, religious, intellectual, and economic developments of Europe, Africa, and the Americas, as well as the connections, struggles, and mutual influences between the peoples of these three continents. Throughout the semester we will study several important topics: medieval precedents of early modern expansion; theories of empire; ideologies and systems of conquest and colonialization; the relevance of race and slavery to the understanding of the early modern Atlantic world; how different peoples perceived others and themselves; how European imperialism and colonialization affected the internal development of Africa and America; the role played by religion in the Atlantic world; persistence and continuity of Native cultures and beliefs during an age of expansion; the creation of new identities; the role played by African nations in the creation of the Atlantic world; and the creation of an Atlantic economy.",

One perspective argues that native peoples had little impact on the environments because of their low population densities, limited technology, and conservation ethic and worldview. At other extreme, biodiversity, and Nature itself, is considered the product of a long history of human activities. This seminar will examine the Myth of the Ecologically Noble Savage, the Myth of the Pristine Environment, the alliance between native peoples and Green Politics, and the contribution of native peoples to appropriate technology, sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity.",

During our discussons, we will consider the ethics between researher and storyteller while addresing the following questions: How do emotions, performances, and identities (gender, sexuality, race, age (dis)ability, etc.) inform the stories we tell and collect? How does history impact the contemporary construction and narration of history? How does the practice and procedure of black women's and queer autobiography, biography and oral history inform interdisciplinary research methods and blur narrative genres?",

This state of affairs is hardly historically unique- complex interconnections have existed for centuries. Yet this course looks behind the numbers to consider whether the current moment is qualitatively different from earlier iterations of globalization. How do we understand a roadbuilt by Chinese laborers in Nigeria, a \"Chinese\" airport in Sudan, a copper mine in Zambia, a gold mine in Peru, oil investments in Venezuela and Ecuador, or massively increasing trade with Brazil? Together we will explore Chinese state and firm-level interventions in Africa and Latin America as harbingers of an emergent global economic structure, largely defined by intensified and re-configured South-South linkages. Through the disciplinary methods of anthropology, political economy, management, and media studies we will consider both the historical context of intensified Chinese involvement in these regions and a wide range of more contemporary ethnographies and case studies. In the process, we will subject transnational economic studies, the statements of managers and officials, and popular culture texts alike to fine-grained readings. 129",

Latino incorporation into the U.S. labor force, earnings and economic well-being among Latino-origin groups, assimilation and the second generation. The course will stress the importance of understanding Latinos within the overall system of race and ethnic relations in the U.S., as well as in comparison with previous immigration flows, particularly from Europe. We will pay particular attention to the economic impact of Latio immigration on both the U.S. receiving and Latin American sending communities, and the efficacy and future possililities of U.S. immigration policy. Within all of these diverse topics, we will stress the heterogeneity of the Latino population according to national origin groups (i.e. Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Latinos), as well as generational differences between immigrants and the native born.",

We emphazise a transnational hemispheric perspective on the Americas in order to think through what was \"new\" about the \"new world\", long before Columbus landedin Hispaniola in 1492, as well as what continues to be new today as new people,products, and ideas continue to populate the region. Throughout the course, wewill contextualize our questions about borderlands and frontiers, empires and colonialism, adaptations and creolizations, and politics and economics within a global frame. And finally, we will highlight the ways anthropologists from different backgrounds have contributed to the public debates regarding the mostpressing issues facing us today, and can work together to enrich our understanding of varius contemporary problems.",
