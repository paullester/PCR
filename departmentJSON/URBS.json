    "course_description" : "Focusing on presidents, governors, and big-city mayors, this course will explore a wide range of historical and recent examples of executive leadership and decision-making. How do their actions in office shape and get shaped by long-term historical and political forces? How and why do executive office holders use (and occasionally abuse) their power? What opportunities exist to transform both policy and public opinion? What kinds of constraints circumscribe the options available and limit the impact of executive choices? Exploring presidents such as Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and Barack Obama, governors including Ronald Reagan, Nelson Rockefeller and Bill Clinton, and mayors like Richard Daley, Sr. and Jr., Ed Koch, and Ed Rendell, this course at once examines the personalities and predilections of individuals as well as the political ideas and institutions that shape their time in office.

The globalization of the economy, the spread of communications technology, major migrations between urban locations, increasing disparities between rich and poor, the dramatic growth of the \"culture industries\", and the increasingly popular quest for \"place making\" through urban design have all contributed to this process. This course will examine urban neighborhoods in the United States and elsewhere in the world. In particular, class readings and discussions will explore the wide range of ways (political, social, cultural; organized and informal) that individuals and institutions in urban neighborhoods have reacted to global transformations and what effects and consequences those reactions have precipitated.",

Such \"sites of memory\" not only instruct us about significant events of the past, but do so in the space and time of the present. And yet, the historical memory of cities is also made legible through modes of cultural expression and inscription - including literature, visual art, graffiti, music, and street performance. Cycles of urban de-industrialization and renewal since the 1970s, as well as legacies of conflict and inequality, have exacerbated the need for alternate forms of commemoration. The Occupy movement is one continued example of how urban space can be reanimated through demarcation, embodiment, and calls for collectivity. In the course, \"Memory, Monuments, and Urban Space\", we will explore literary, cultural, and architectural approaches to historical memory and urban policy. We will look to officially sanctioned monuments as well as countercultural or grassroots expressions of memory as sites to study cultures of urban space. We will focus primarily on the period between 1968 and the present, considering the role of race, gender, sexuality, and class in debates about cultural memory, and we will delve into such ongoing matters of historical reflection: the Vietnam War, the War on Drugs, the MOVE bombing, the AIDS epidemic, and 9/11. Students will develop skills useful for urban spatial and historical analysis through readings of contemporary cultural productions, engaged online research through social media platforms, and regular fieldwork observations at monument sites around Philadelphia.",

    "course_description" : "Over the past two decades, the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars, corporations, advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era. These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society, but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola, Nike and Hollywood films), and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF, World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets). Moreover, we will study globalization in the context of cities because, given their centrality to globalization processes, it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities, we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space, giving rise to new financial districts, international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light, contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America, Asia and Africa.",

This course will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of how people create, perceive, and use the designed environment.

How humans experience them are more easily studied and understood in an urban setting, giving this class the opportunity to explore social relational and cultural themes such as the ethnic city, the contested city, the global city, and the creative city.

The diversity of immigrant and receiving communities means that the dynamics and impacts of migration are varied and complex. This course examines the development of immigrant and receiving communities in the United States. It surveys public policy and community and economic development practices related to migration at the local, regional, national, and trans-national scale. Class readings, discussions, and visits to Philadelphia's immigrant neighborhoods explore themes including labor markets, housing experiences, political mobilization, civil society, cultural preservation, and the built environment. The first half of the course surveys migration and community formation among a broad range of ethnic groups in different parts of the city and suburbs, mainly through history, sociology, and geography; the second half focuses on specific policy and community and economic development initiatives. The major class project will be a study of gentrification in Philadelphia's Chinatown with the community organization Asian Americans United, part of a multi-city Chinatown study in collaboration with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund and colleagues in Boston and New York.",

Co-opted by marketing slogans, stripped of meaning and context, it has become vague and pliable. It does, however, have a real meaning, which will form the basis for examining nature in the city. Sustainability demands a systems view of both the economy and environment and understanding the management of their interactions.

The present course will offer a survey of the history of Prussia, beginning with the seventeenth century, and the unification of the small towns of Berlin and koelln to establish a new capital for this country. It will tell the story of Berlin's rising political prominence in the eighteenth century, its transformation into an industrial city in the late nineteenth century, its rise to metropolis in the early twentieth century, its history during the Third Reich, and the post-war cold war period. The course will conclude its historical survey with a consideration of Berlin's position as a capital in reunified Germany. The historical survey will be supplemented by a study of Berlin's urban structure, its significant architecture from the eighteenth century (i.e. Schinkel) to the nineteenth (new worker's housing, garden suburbs) and twentieth centuries (Bauhaus, Speer designs, postwar rebuilding, GDR housing projects, post-unification building boom). In addition, we will read literary texts about the city, and consider the visual art and music created in and about Berlin. Indeed, Berlin will be a specific example to explore German history and cultural life of the last 300 years. The course will be interdisciplinary with the fields of German Studies, history, history of art, and urban studies. It is also designed as a preparation for undergraduate students who are considering spending a junior semester with the Penn Abroad Program in Berlin.",

    "course_description" : "This course assesses the changing role of public policy in American cities. In the past, government often believed that it could direct urban development. New realities - the rise of an informal labor market, global capital and labor flows, the flight of businesses and the middle class to the suburbs - have demonstrated that government must see itself as one - but only one - 'player' in a more complete, transactional process of policy making that crosses political boundaries and involves business, organized interest groups, and citizens. This seminar uses a case-study method to study how public policy can make a difference in the revitalization of distressed American cities. The seminar is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Seminar readings and projects will be organized around three themes: 1) history and vision, 2) data and analysis, and 3) policy and implementation. Students will be divided into project teams assigned to work on current development issues that will be reviewed by both public and private-sector experts. Extensive use will be made of real estate, economic development, and social indicator data to understand the complex forces at work in both large and small cities. Students will learn to access, analyze, and map information; to frame and interpret these data within a regional perspective; and to construct profiles of cities and neighborhoods. Students will study recent urban redevelopment initiatives in the Philadelphia region, including Philadelphia's Neighborhood Transformations Initiative and New Jersey's Camden Revitalization plans.",

Student will be studying early childhood development and learning while providing direct, one-to-one tutoring services to young students in Philadelphia public elementary schools. The course will cover foundational dimensions of the cognitive and social development of preschool and elementary school students from a multicultural perspective. The course will place a special emphasis on the multiple contexts that influence children's development and learning and how aspects of classroom environment (i.e., curriculum and classroom management strategies) can impact children's achievement. Also, student will consider a range of larger issues impacting urban education embedded in American society. The course structure has three major components: (1) lecture related directly to readings on early childhood development and key observation and listening skills necessary for effective tutoring, (2) weekly contact with a preschool or elementary school student as a volunteer tutor and active consideration of how to enhance the student learning, and (3) discussion and reflection of personal and societal issues related to being a volunteer tutor in a large urban public school.",

The first part of the course discusses the broad theory of urban economics by focusing on individual decision makers, both households and businesses, and the incentives they face as the key to understanding how cities operate economically. Significant topics include economic development, zoning, and land use. The second part of the course discusses several topics in detail, including transportation, government taxation and spending, housing, education, and cost-benefit analysis. We will use current local issues as examples in the course. These issues will include tax reform, the development of the Delaware riverfront, casino locations, the ten-year tax abatements for new construction and rehabilitation, the real estate \"bubble,\" and tax increment financing. At the conclusion of the course the student will be able to apply economic thinking to the analysis of civic issues, understand how economic forces shaped and continue to shape the urban environment, and appreciate the role of government as an enabler or a hindrance. The emphasis of the course is on the usefulness of economic thought and, as such, focuses more on policy implications than abstract economic modeling. Thecourse will teach any necessary economic tools, though an introductory course in microeconomics is helpful.",

On the contrary, the challenge is that the interactions of various kinds of cultures are becoming more complex and differentiated at the same time as new forms of globalization and modernization are bringing all parts of the earth into greater, uneven, polycentric interaction.\" - Michael Fischer, Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice, 2003 This course introduces anthropological theories of culture and multiculturalism and the method of ethnography as these apply to understanding diversity in contemporary life. After learning the basic concepts through reading key texts and writing response papers, students will apply the concepts by (1) writing an ethnic autobiography; (2) critiquing a film or novel with a multicultural theme; and (3) conducting a mini-ethnography of a multicultural site of their choice. These projects are designed to encourage students to reflect on the meaning of multiculturaliam from three different angles: personal experience, media representation, and participant observation of diversity in a multicultural site (which could be at Penn). The goal is to learn about the role and the impacts of diversity in the US vis-a-vis constitutionally guaranteed rights to liberty, equality, and democratic justice.",

This course is structured as a seminar with ethnographic background readings from Philadelphia and other urban settings to introduce students to the study of the city as a site of everyday practice, as well as training in conducting an ethnographic fieldwork project. The urban landscape provides an intensification of macro processes such as globalization. Such processes and how humans experience them are more easily studied and understood in an urban setting. The class will explore social relational and cultural themes such as the ethnic city, the gendered city, the contested city, the sacred city, the global city, and the aesthetic and expressive city. A diverse range of reading assignments, images, and videos will augment our understandings of urban life. Students will design and execute their own ethnographic fieldwork projects on an urban topic that interests them. Through step-by-step instruction throughout the semester, students will learn qualitative research techniques such as field notes, participant-observation, interviewing, and how to interpret their own data, so that they will be able to complete their semester project.",

A primary goal of the seminar is to help students develop proposals as to how a Penn undergraduate education might better empower students to produce, not simply \"consume,\" societally-useful knowledge, as well as function as caring, contributing citizens of a democratic society.

Rooted in the rubric of public interest social science, the course focuses on: 1) merging problem solving with theory and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice, racial harmony, equality, and human rights; and 2)engaging in public debate on human issues to make the research results accessible to a broad audience. The workshop brings in guest speakers and will incorporate original ethnographic research to merge theory with action. Students are encouraged to apply the framing model to a public interest research and action topic of their choice.

    "course_description" : "In the years since the 1965 repeal of nationality based quotas, immigration to the United States has surged. Not only has the number of immigrants reached record highs, they have come from different places. During the last great wave of immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, immigrants came largely from southern and eastern Europe. Today, they come primarily from Latin America and Asia. Formerly, they usually settled in cities, moving outward as their prosperity increased; today, many bypass cities, heading straight for suburbs where a majority of immigrants now live. They are reviving moribund city economies and providing essential labor for service industries, construction, landscaping, and some manufacturing as well as well as for some professions and high tech jobs. Yet, new immigration has resulted in massive expenditures on border control, huge increases in deportation, and a fierce national political debate about the impact of immigration and immigration reform. Debates about immigration frequently rest, either implicitly or explicitly on assumptions about the history of immigration and immigration policy. These assumptions frequently are incorrect - with major implications for public understanding and public policy. There are few public issues in which history matters as much as it does for immigration. This seminar will provide the historical background essential for framing discussions of immigration today. It will consider the origins, demography, and geography of immigration and will pay special attention to the history of immigration policy. Requirements include reading approximately one book per week, writing several short commentary papers on readings, and leading workshops on the primary sources for the study of immigr ation history.",

Through weekly readings, regular response papers, class discussions and exercises, a research paper using primary sources, and walking tours, this course explores the industrialization and deindustrialization of American cities within their evolving global context from the era of European colonization to the present. Themes include energy and ecology, labor and production, inner city and suburban development, globalization, and economic restructuring. Ultimately, the class aims to give students a broad knowledge of 1) the history of industrial capitalism, 2) its effects on cities and regions over the past three centuries, and 3) analytical tools for understanding the past, present, and future of metropolitan economies, geography, and society.",

The course is designed to bridge the divide between theory and practice. Each class session looks at issues of equity in relation to an area of practice (e.g. lesson design, curriculum planning, fostering positive student identities, classroom management, school funding, policy planning...), while bringing theoretical frames to bear from the fields of education, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Among the theoretical frames students will learn will be the tools of systems thinking (Bertalanffy, 1968). While most of us have internalized the key lesson of the industrial revolution-that to understand something we must break it into its parts; systems thinking, in contrast, is about understanding the parts in relation to whole. The power of systems thinking is that each point of connection also serves as a point of intervention. By showing the importance of decisions of those within classrooms and those outside of them, this course is well-suited to students of education, but also any who seek a role in creating a more just society.",

Middle school students will learn about the food environment and about why culture matters when we talk about food. Topics include traditional and modern foodways, ethnic cuisine in America, food preferences, and 'American cuisine'. The course integrates classroom work about food culture and anthropological practice with frequent trips to middle school where undergraduates will collaborate with students, their teachers, and a teacher partner from the Agatson Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI). Students will be required to attend one of two time blocks each week to fulfill the service learning requirement-times TBA. Undergraduates will be responsible for weekly writing assignments responding to learning experience in the course, for preparing materials to use middle school children, being participant-learners with the middle school children, and for a final research project. The material for the course will address the ideas underlying university-community engagement, the relationships that exist between food/eating and culture, and research methods.",

After a comprehensive overview of the structures of labor and housing markets and of nondiscriminatory reasons (that is, the cumulative effects of past discrimination and/or experiences) for the existence of group differentials in employment, wages, and residential locations, various theories of the sources of current discrimination are reviewed and evaluated.

Lifestyle and urban form evolve together in an iterative fashion affected by changes in technology, communication, economics and cultural, social, political values. This seminar examines the underlying forces that are continuing to transform urban form and the relationship of these forces to contemporary urban lifestyles. Lifestyle choices have become an engine of urban growth and are instrumental in the transformation of urban life and form of the city. The spatialization of contemporary life and the physical forms and fabric that support it call into question traditional definitions of 'urban life' and 'city form.' The seminar's broad context is the interface between the physical/psychological permanence of the existing traditional city and the changing spatial and cultural landscape of a new urban realm defined by consumption culture, new technologies and the media age. The research focus for Spring 2015 will be the transformation of Brooklyn neighborhoods from industrial working class centers to enclaves of hipster lifestyles. Hipsters have become commodified and part of the commercial world but their role as urban shapers who put forth new values, new urban lifestyles and new urban character has left a mark on neighborhoods from economic revival to gentrification. Hipsters wield a combination of technology, values and cultural forces that together are transforming urban places. Many of these underlying values have become the province as well of educated middle-class population often living ideologically. We propose these groups are the seeds of new types of consciousness united by shared values that have the potential to provide an alternative vision for an urban domain that balances a long-term view with more temporal individual choices.",

Since then, cities have been regularly at the center of major films and film movements - gangster movies in the 1930s; film noir in the 1940s; MGM musicals in the 1950s; French New Wave in the 1960s; Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese in the 1970s; Stephen Frears, Hanif Kureishi, Spike Lee, and Mike Leigh in the 1980s; and DIY, indie, and \"mumblecore\" movements today. This special, one-time-only course, offered as part of Penn's Arts & The City Year, will examine both cities and cinema, including a wide range of movies, from all different countries and periods; theories and histories of urban planning and urban experience (from the Frankfurt School to Richard Florida) and film culture, resources, and events in Philadelphia, New York, and elsewhere. All students will make a short film in Philadelphia as a final class project. Other required work will include screenings, readings, class participation, and writing assignments.",

By bridging theory and practice, the class explores what dynamics are at play to deliver vital services or programs in healthcare, education, the arts, community development, and other issues. The course will also focus on these important questions: (1) Whose responsibility is the public good? How is that responsibility shared by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors? and (2) Given that responsibility for the public good, which individuals and groups make the decisions about how to serve the public good? How are these decisions made, and who benefits from these decisions? Students will consider these questions in an interdisciplinary context that will bring a historical and philosophical perspective to the examination of the values and institutions that characterize the contemporary philanthropy and the nonprofit sector.",

    "course_description" : "This course assesses the changing role of public policy in American cities. In the past, government often believed that it could direct urban development. New realities - the rise of an informal labor market, global capital and labor flows, the flight of businesses and the middle class to the suburbs - have demonstrated that government must see itself as one - but only one - 'player' in a more complete, transactional process of policy making that crosses political boundaries and involves business, organized interest groups, and citizens. This seminar uses a case study method to study how public policy can make a difference in the revitalization of distressed American cities. The seminar is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Seminar readings and projects will be organized around three themes: 1) history and vision, 2) data and analysis, and 3) policy and implementation. Students will be divided into project teams assigned to work on current development issues that will be reviewed by both public and private-sector experts. Extensive use will be made of real estate, economic development, and social indicator data to understand the complex forces at work in both large and small cities. Students will learn to access, analyze, and map information; to frame and interpret these data within a regional perspective; and to construct profiles of cities and neighborhoods. Students will study recent urban redevelopment initiatives in the Philadelphia region - including Philadelphia's Neighborhood Transformations Initiative and New Jersey's Camden Revitalization plans.",

    "course_description" : "Using Philadelphia as the site of students' praxis, this course explores the symbolic meanings and social production of urban life and culture in the nation's fifth largest city. This course is structured as a seminar with ethnographic background readings from Philadelphia and other urban settings to introduce students to the study of the city as a site of everyday practice, as well as training in conducting an ethnographic fieldwork project. The urban landscape provides an intensification of macro processes such as globalization. Such processes and how humans experience them are more easily studied and understood in an urban setting. The class will explore social relational and cultural themes such as the ethnic city, the gendered city, the contested city, the sacred city, the global city, and the aesthetic and expressive city. A diverse range of reading assignments, images, and videos will augment our understandings of urban life. Students will design and execute their own ethnographic fieldwork projects on an urban topic that interests them. Through step-by-step instruction throughout the semester, students will learn qualitative research techniques such as field notes, participant-observation, interviewing, and how to interpret their own data, so that they will be able to complete their semester project.",

    "course_description" : "How do qualitative social scientists study urban communities? What kinds of powerful tales can be told about urban lifestyles and social issues/conflicts in places like Philadelphia? This course will allow students to study various ethnographic treatments of urban communities in the United States, using films, articles, TV serials, and books as guides for the framing of their own independent research on the streets of Philadelphia. Students will also form production teams of two or three people, and these production teams will be responsible for (i) identifying and researching an important urban issue in contemporary Philadelphia and (ii) turning that research into a 15-30 minute radio documentary that will be broadcast on a local Philadelphia radio station, WURD 900AM. Mixing radio/audio journalism with ethnographic methods, will enhance their skills at archival and social research, participant- observation, interviewing techniques, sound editing, and production. This course is intended to be a rigorous and exciting opportunity for students to tell empirically grounded stories using the voices of their subjects and the sounds of the city. Potential texts include: Sidewalk (a book and documentary film my Mitchell my Mitchell Duneier), Righteous Dopefiend (a book and museum exhibit by Philippe Bourgois), and excerpts from other ethnographic work by Ana Ramos-Zayas, Elijah Anderson, Todd Wolfson, David Grazian, Setha Low, Ulf Hannerz, Leith Mullings, John Gwaltney, Dana-ain Davis, Carol Stack, Melissa Checker, Katherine S.

Major topics include regional planning and policy, sustainable agriculture, food access and distribution, and markets. The class includes a mix of lectures, discussion, and field trips; students will work on real-world projects in Philadelphia. Ultimately, the course aims to develop students' broad knowledge of food systems planning in the global North and South, with an emphasis on community and economic development strategies for sustainable food systems and food security. The course is divided into four units, covering: 1) an introduction to food systems (industrial, organic, local), related ecological theory, and traditional planning institutions' roles in shaping food systems; 2) community food security, hunger, and related public policy; 3) community and economic development strategies and techniques for promoting local food economies and community food security; and 4) sustainable agriculature and food distribution sytems at the site, neighborhood, and city scale. For undergraduates, this course is by permission of instructor only. Students interested in taking the course should ideally have some background working in planning and community development and/or food systems. Undergraduates must submit a one-paragraph statement explaining their preparation and interest in the topic by January 12 to urbs@sas.upenn.edu. Students will be notified of enrollment by the first class meeting in January.",

Contemporary homelessness differs significantly from related conditions of destitute poverty during other eras of our nation's history. Advocates, researchers and policymakers have all played key roles in defining the current problem, measuring its prevalence, and designing interventions to reduce it. The first section of this course examines the definitional and measurement issues, and how they affect our understanding of the scale and composition of the problem. Explanations for homelessness have also been varied, and the second part of the course focuses on examining the merits of some of those explanations, and in particular, the role of the affordable housing crisis. The third section of the course focuses on the dynamics of homelessness, combining evidence from ethnographic studies of how people become homeless and experience homelessness, with quantitative research on the patterns of entry and exit from the condition. The final section of the course turns to the approaches taken by policymakers and advocates to address the problem, and considers the efficacy and quandaries associated with various policy strategies. The course concludes by contemplating the future of homelessness research and public policy.",

Sustainability is about carrying capacity: making resource decisions without compromising the ability of future generations to make their own resource decisions. Sustainability thus requires an understanding of the systems whose carrying capacities matter for human endurance; three prominent and interconnected systems are the environment, the economy, and society. Sustainability also requires an understanding of the decision-making that operates on these resource systems and affects their carrying capacities. In sum, the study of Sustainability requires an introduction to environmental science, energy production, human settlements, economic development, social justice, policy development, and international relations. This course will provide that introduction though a weekly lecture series drawing on scholars from across the university and a small group project that addresses a real problem confronting an institution in Philadelphia.

This course will chart the history of this phenomenon from its radical origins in Futurism, Constructivism, and Dada cabaret, through Happenings, the inter-disciplinary collaborations of Merce Cunningham, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns, site-specific and installation art, to current practitioners around the world, such as Ai Weiwei, Thomas Hirschhorn, Marina Abramovic, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude, among others. The course will outline the theoretical and philosophical foundations of this work and the political controversies it has ignited. Special focus will be on the engagement of this work with public space and contemporary urban life. Course requirements include wide reading and class discussion, and oral presentations on artists, collectives, and movements that have significantly shaped the current landscape. The course includes a laboratory component in which students will have the opportunity to construct a performance art or installation piece in campus public space. This public art piece will serve as site research for a final paper. All students welcome. No previous experience or special expertise in the field required. Just genuine interest or curiosity.",

This introduction to sound studies course will provide both a rigorous conceptual and also a creative, hands-on understanding of the phenomena at the center of Penn's Year of Sound. We will explore how sound and auditory cultures have been theorized, how soundscapes shape and transform built environments and the social relations they underpin or express, how technologies have affected our relationships to sound, and how we might go about investigating aural phenomena. The course will focus on sound in urban spaces. Structured around a number of themes that cut across disciplinary, historical and geographical boundaries, the course will create a transatlantic dialogue between investigative fieldwork into Philadelphia?s soundscape and the changing auditory profile of Paris from the clatter of medieval sword fights through the cultivation of modern urban experience in Haussmann's boulevards to the contemporary soundscape. Other topics will include the role of sound-reproduction and mobile technologies, and the consumption and regulation of sound. We will encounter a wide variety of materials from literary texts to mobile apps and video games, not to mention a vast range of sounds, and we will tackle the topic from multiple interdisciplinary angles from Continental philosophy to urban anthropology to ask how sound composes urban space, transforming social bonds and power relations. Alongside written work, you will make field recordings on the streets of Philadelphia and develop creative projects using media of your choice to reflect upon urban sound.",

Such histories are intelligible to dwellers of urban space in the present who seek them out and others who by default interact with the effects of memory through art and culture. Through the expansion of digital mapping tools, location-enabled devices, online sharing sites, and social media memes, those layers of urban memory are newly accessible and thus enhance experiences and explorations in a city. How do websites and apps devoted to mapping cities across space and time help us access and redefine the cultures of cities? What approaches, programs, and philosophies do the newfangled mapmakers and their co-creators use, and how do they differ from analog approaches to research and placemaking? What are the possibilities and responsibilities of such digital cartographies and locales? Where and for whom do the digital divides still exist? In \"Digital City: Approaches to Urban Memory and Cartography,\" we will seek solutions to these prompts by conducting case studies of digital map projects from transnational and local perspectives, including a particular focus on Philadelphia-based sites. Students will gain skills in cultural analysis and the digital humanities, and will produce a final research project that will result in a website, mobile app, or critical assignment of their own direction mapping a city's past onto its present or future spaces.",

It uses a systems analysis as the framework for looking at who makes what kinds of demands on the education policy system, how these demands are placed on the policy agenda, the decision making process, and resulting education policies and policy outcomes. The course pays particular attention to the roles of federal, state and local governments in education policy, and the impact of our intergovernmental system on the design and implementation of policy. Students will also examine major education policies and debate key education policy issues that arise at each level of government.",

    "course_description" : "Over fifty percent of the world's population now lives in cities. Neoliberalism - the ideology and accompanying policies and practices that champion the shifting of political decision making from the public sector to the private sector - has been widely recognized as having shown dramatic growth worldwide since the 1970s. It has also been widely regarded as a product of globalization. This course traces the history of neo-liberalism in global context with particular attention to neoliberalism's relationship to cities, and exam the role that urban growth has played in spurring neoliberal policies and practices. It asks how policy makers, voters, and private interest worldwide have responded to the growth of urban poverty and slums, challenges within urban public education, unequal resource distribution, environmental pressures experienced within urban sanitation and waste disposal systems, and increased demands for municipal services like water, electricity, and transport infrastructures, and examined the rise of public-private partnerships, gated communities, initiatives to privatize education and municipal services, and efforts to relocate slum-dwellers and beautify cities as explicit strategies for attracting \"global capital\". The course also asks how the recent rise of neoliberal policies and practices differs from earlier market-driven and private sector-led forms of political governance. The British and Dutch East India Companies are two famous examples of joint stock companies that assume administrative and political roles over their colonies. How did the rise of these colonial relationships differ from current neoliberal shifts. Readings will draw heavily from ethnographic and urban studies, scholarship on South Asia, as well as Latin America, South Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America, exploring what each of these specific contexts has to teach us more generally about the relationship between urbanization, global capitalism, public and private sectors, and political processes and decision-making.",

The central focus will be on developing a comprehensive understanding of the principles of sustainable development, a broad, deep, and in fact, revolutionary new way of shaping the operations of society. It was first defined in the 1987 Report of the United Nations' World Commission in Environment and Development (the Brundtland Report) as: \"... development that meets the needs to the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" The course will combine lectures on general concepts and ways of viewing sustainable development with individuals and team presentations on a wide variety of sustainable development programs. Students will examine the efforts of universities, companies, local governments, state governments, and national governments to being to moderate man's impact of the natural environment and to make societies more economically viable and just - and therefore, more sustainable - in the long run. Students will learn how sustainable development strategies involve the full range of human activities, such as energy production and use, creation of urban communities, transportation, food systems, building construction and operation, waste disposal, control of environmental pollution, water use and treatment, and social inclusion, migration, and global poverty.",

This virtual heritage museum provides a collective portrait of families and individuals who have had histories in West Philadelphia and is intended as an ever-revised and expanded resource by and for members of the West Philadelphia community, especially for teachers and their students. The website for the virtual museum was first expanded and updated during hte fall of 2010 by students in an Academically Based Community Service course taught by Professor Walter Licht of the History Department and Mark Lloyd. To be offered as an ABCS course in Fall 2014, it will continue the work of developing the virutal history museum. Students will engage in research projects that contribute to one or more of the following categories: a general history of West Philadelphia, accounts of its neighborhoods and their institutions, a historical economic narrative of the area, a re-photographic survey of area landmarks, and the further collecting and posting to the website of personal and family stories.",

Without access to power that might otherwise come from political, financial or personal networks, community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign, it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history, most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material, case study reviews, guest speaker presentations, inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.",

    "course_description" : "This course will examine the idea of the city in history and how that idea has changed over time. We will use literature, philosophy, sociology, and history to explore the ways writers and thinkers have defined and characterized the city and what these definitions reflect in terms of values, assumptions, and knowledge through changing times - as well as how the definitions have been contested. For Aristotle the city was the inevitable consequence of people's inherent sociability, and as such was a natural, positive agent of acculturation and education. For others, such as Jefferson, Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, and Poe - members of the American literacy and political pantheon all - cities embodied the crystallization of moral ruin. Others fell somewhere in between. Thus for Walt Whitman and Jane Addams, cities had numerous defects but also contained the seeds of their own flowering and renaissance. Members of the golden age of urban studies - Lewis Mumford, Jane Jacobs, and the Chicago School - offered new insights and empirical tools for thinking about cities, and we will examine their contributions as well. More contemporaneously, some critics of globalization locate cities at the epicenter of their discontent with modernity while others view cities as a locus for a revitalized form of citizenship. In this course, we will examine each of these perspectives, with the goal of cultivating a deeper and broader understanding of the many ways the idea of the city has played a leading role in fostering rich debate about how and where humans should live their lives.",

    "course_description" : "How do American cities grow? Studies of urban transformation have focused on anchor institutions, the growth model of big business-generated employment, and \"creative class\" gentrification. After decades of decline, many major cities like Philadelphia are seeing gains in population again, as well as new commercial activity and street life, spurred by the influx of new immigrant communities. Yet few scholars have asked: What role do immigrants play in the current revival of the American metropolis? In this Social Science Studio course, 16 students will work collaboratively as in a design studio to conduct research that can answer this important social-scientific question. Students will work on independent projects that engage multiple methods and fields to produce new types of knowledge. They will be introduced to multiple methods drawn from architecture, planning, anthropology and political science, including mapping, interviewing, field notes, socio-economic surveys, sketching, photography and web design to develop independent projects. No prior knowledge is required but students with experience in GIS, STATA, photography, drawing or web design are encouraged to apply. This course is pending for an ABCS designation.",
