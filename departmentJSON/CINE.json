Rather than necessarily signifying the rise of a democratic politics or a process of media democratization, the politics of that participation are contingent and instantiated rather than determined in advance. The course will explore how this politics of participation actually plays out in a range of contemporary media 'hot spots' - reality television, user-generated content online, debates about the future of journalism in an online environment heavily populated by bloggers and citizen journalists, the connection between the commodification of celebrity and the construction of social identities, utopian and dystopian readings of the potential of new media, and populist formations of talk radio.",

Yet in spite of this history of dismissal, British cinema has a long and complex history that we will begin to explore through film screenings, critical reading, and visits to archives and museums. Topics covered will include: Early Cinema of Attractions ; British cinema s relation to other countries; war propaganda and the British documentary film; cinematic adaptations of British literature; British film theory; British experimental film/moving images in the art gallery; British cinema and identity.

The scope and substance of the festival provide a unique opportunity, not only for students of cinema, but also for liberal arts students studying cultural diversity and international relations. In preparation for fieldwork at the Cannes Film Festival in May, two three-hours introductory lectures will be held in late March and April on Penn's campus to enable students to establish a critical vocabulary for film study. The lectures and subsequent discussions will examine: a) The Business and Art of the Film Festival; b) Contemporary International Cinema. Those introductory lectures will be coordinated with the Philadelphia Film Festival, which is held on April 5-18, 2007. During both the Philadelphia Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival, students attend screenings of current international films, applying the critical tools and knowledge of the film industry gained from their earlier work. Students research and critique both the artistic aspects and the commercial p",

A combination of lectures by instructors and practitioners, case studies, film screenings, and consulting projects with independent and Hollywood creators, packagers, financiers, exhibitors, distributors and publicists will illustrate the relationship between the art of film and the business of film. Guests will include screenwriters, agents, producers, directors, distributors, film festival curators and film critics. In short, we will try to cover all aspects of making a film, and explore that often-tricky intersection of art and commerce.",

We draw on film theory, psychoanalysis, literary analysis, cognitive theory, communication studies, and visual anthropology to discuss several key issues related to the state of film/filmmaking in an age of \"digital\" media. We interrogate contentious notions of authority, reflexivity, and objectivity. We analyze film's claim to \"realistic\" (iconic and indexical) representation. We interrogate how \"film\" and \"video\" get imagined in all their visual particularity, sometimes conflated into a single visual form and at other moments distinguished as a function of the difference between photochemical and electro-magnetic processes. We also highlight the kinds of techniques filmmakers use to thematize these same issues \"on screen.\" Students will be responsible for watching one film each week (along with the the course readings), and part of the final project involves helping to produce a group documentary/ethnographic \"film\" that engages the course's central concerns.",

Many of the themes (of desire, transgression, suspicion, discovery) at the heart of these stories also lie at the core of many modern narratives. Is there anything special, we will ask, about the case of adultery--once called \"a crime which contains within itself all others\"? What might these stories teach us about the way we read in general? By supplementing classic literary accounts by Shakespeare, Pushkin, Flaubert, Chekhov, and Proust with films and with critical analyses, we will analyze the possibilities and limitations of the different genres and forms under discussion, including novels, films, short stories, and theatre. What can these forms show us (or not show us)about desire, gender, family and social obligation? Through supplementary readings and class discussions, we will apply a range of critical approaches to place these narratives of adultery in a social and literary context, including formal analyses of narrative and style, feminist criticism, Marxist and sociological analyses of the family, and psychoanalytic understandings of desire and family life.",

We will consider works such as Pare Lorentz's 1938 film The River to Silent Spring and Al Gore's various endeavors. We will talk with filmmakers such as Josh Fox, director of Gasland. We will take a specific issue, such as plastic waste, and look at examples of advocacy across different media platforms, from photography showing the carcasses of albatross chicks with stomachs burst full of plastic scraps to documentaries about the plastic zone in the Pacific--analyzing the rhetorical strategies and aesthetic and practical effects of different approaches.",

The first half of the course focuses on African-American film images from the early years of D.W. Griffith's \"renegade bucks\" in The Birth of a Nation (1915); to the comic servants played by Steppin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and others during the Depression era; to the post-World War II New Negro heroes and heroines of Pinky (1949) and The Defiant Ones (1958); to the rise of the new movement of African American directors such as Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing), Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust), Charles Burnett, (To Sleep With Anger) and John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood). The second half explores television images from the early sitcoms \"Amos 'n Andy\" and \"Beulah\" to the \"Cosby Show,\" \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" and \"Martin.\" Foremost this course will examine Black stereotypes in American films and television--and the manner in which those stereotypes have reflected national attitudes and outlooks during various historical periods. This course will also explore the unique \"personal statements\" and the sometimes controversial \"star personas\" of such screen artists as Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge, Paul Robeson, Richard Pryor, Oscar Micheaux, Spike Lee, Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, and Whoopi Goldberg. The in-class screenings and discussions will include such films as Show Boat (1936), the independently produced \"race movies\" of the 1930s and 1940s, Cabin in the Sky (1943), The Defiant Ones (1958), Imitation of Life (the 1959 remake), Super Fly (1972), and She's Gotta Have It (1986) and such television series as \"I Spy,\" \"Julia,\" \"Good Times,\" \"The Jeffersons,\" \"Roots,\" \"A Different World,\" \"I'll Fly Away,\" \"LA Law,\" and \"Hangin' With Mr. Cooper.\"",

At the same time, we will deal with film sound in general: the technology that made silent movies talk, the rules and tricks of sound and music production for film, and the scientific and aesthetic theories behind different approaches to the soundtrack. One goal of the course is for students to learn to listen analytically to what is heard on a soundtrack. Another is to get a sense for the ways that European classical music (opera and symphony) influenced and continues to influence film composers. Students do not need to read music for this course: we deal with film music on an aural basis and look at musical notation occasionally.

Topics include the emergence of film technology and early film audiences, the rise of narrative film and birth of Hollywood, national film industries and movements, African-American independent film, the emergence of the genre film (the western, film noir, and romantic comedies), ethnographic and documentary film, animated films, censorship, the MPPDA and Hays Code, and the introduction of sound. We will conclude with the transformation of several film industries into propaganda tools during World War II (including the Nazi, Soviet, and US film industries). In addition to contemporary theories that investigate the development of cinema and visual culture during the first half of the 20th century, we will read key texts that contributed to the emergence of film theory.

We will simultaneously cover the technical aspects of production that will enable you to produce digital video projects: shooting (Canon GL1s), lighting, sound, editing (Final Cut Pro on Mac), graphics, music, and so on.

Her polemic ignited new waves of knowledge production about the world making possibilities of female, feminist and outsider art. This seminar considers art at the margins and how it reimagines the visual to perform a rebuttal to male dominated art scenes, heteronormative aesthetics, and racist art markets. Working at the intersection of queer studies, feminist art historical practice, theater, and cinema studies, we will interrogate the aesthetics of identity politics. How does feminist art compel new directions in the way we conceive of labor, value, process, and circulation? How do art practices contest and rewrite normative meanings of bodily and sexual difference? Our class privileges art as a transformative mode of language and critique as we bridge visual culture and scholarship to create multiple lenses of analysis. We will consider diverse genres, for example, body art, photography, film, process art, literature and epistolary forms. We will examine how amateurism, deskilling, display, and objectification become strategic performances of feminist and queer identities and political refusal. Configurations of community, such as appropriation, co-optation, selling out, and safe space will be interrogated. Finally we will look at the Occupy Museum movement to think about the institutionalization of marginalized art forms and makers.",

Beginning with the cinematic revolution signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism (of Rossellini and De Sica), we will follow the evolution of postwar cinema through the French New Wave (of Godard, Resnais, and Varda), American movies of the 1950s and 1960s (including the New Hollywood cinema of Coppola and Scorsese), and the various other new wave movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (such as the New German Cinema). We will then selectively examine some of the most important films of the last two decades, including those of U.S. independent film movement and movies from Iran, China, and elsewhere in an expanding global cinema culture. There will be precise attention paid to formal and stylistic techniques in editing, mise-en-scene, and sound, as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of film. At the same time, those formal features will be closely linked to historical and cultural distinctions and changes, ranging from the Paramount Decision of 1948 to the digital convergences that are defining screen culture today. There are no perquisites. Requirements will include readings in film history and film analysis, an analytical essay, a research paper, a final exam, and active participation.",

Through a study of popular American films and their related merchandise and cultural influences, we will also see how anthropology can be sued to study contemporary cultures.",

Films considered will include: the German expressionists masterworks of the silent era, the Universal classics of the 30's and the low-budget horror films produced by Val Lewton in the 40's for RKO in the US, the 1950's color films of sex and violence by Hammer studios in England, Italian Gothic horror or giallo (Mario Brava) and French lyrical macabre (Georges Franju) in the 60's, and on to contemporary gore. In an effort to better understand how the horror film makes us confront out worst fears and our most secret desires alike, we will look at the genre's main iconic figures (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc.) as well as issues of ethics, gender, sexuality, violence, spectatorship through a variety of critical lenses (psychoanalysis, socio-historial and cultural context, aesthetics,...).",
