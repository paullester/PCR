For the rest of the semester, we will critically read contemporary ethnographies addressing pressing issues such as nationalism, militarism, neoliberalism and fundamentalism. Throughout, we will investigate what it means not only to \"write women's worlds\", but also to analyze broader socio-cultural, political, and economic processes through a gendered lens. We will, finally, address the various ways feminist anthropology fundamentally challenged the discipline's epistemological certainties, as well as how it continues to transform our understanding of the foundations of the modern world.",

The first half of the course focuses on African-American film images from the early years of D.W. Griffith's \"renegade bucks\" in The Birth of a Nation (1915); to the comic servants played by Steppin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and others during the Depression era; to the post-World War II New Negro heroes and heroines of Pinky (1949) and The Defiant Ones (1958); to the rise of the new movement of African American directors such as Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing), Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust), Charles Burnett, (To Sleep With Anger) and John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood). The second half explores television images from the early sitcoms \"Amos 'n Andy\" and \"Beulah\" to the \"Cosby Show,\" \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" and \"Martin.\" Foremost this course will examine Black stereotypes in American films and television--and the manner in which those stereotypes have reflected national attitudes and outlooks during various historical periods. The in-class screenings and discussions will include such films as Show Boat (1936), the independently produced \"race movies\" of the 1930s and 1940s, Cabin in the Sky (1943), The Defiant Ones (1958), Imitation of Life (the 1959 remake) & Super Fly (1972).",

Drawing from all of the major areas of research in Anthropology (biological, archaeological, linguistic, and socio-cultural), we will explore the Americas as a space through w hich to think about processes of colonization, conquest, imperalism, nation-building, and race-making, understanding these processes as necessarily intwined. We emphasize a transnational hemispheric perspective on the Americas in order to think through what was \"new\" about the \"new world\", long before Columbus landed in Hispaniola in 1492, as well as what contnues to be new today as new people, products, and ideas continue to populate the region. Throughout the course, we will contextualize our questions about borderlands and frontiers, empires and colonialism, adaptations and creolizations, andpolitics and economics within a global frame. And finally, we will highlight the ways anthropologists from different backgrounds have contributed to public debates regarding themost pressing issue sfacing us today, and can work together to enrich our undertands of various contemporary problems.",

    "course_description" : "Writing in 2001, literary critic Jahan Ramazani introduced his study The Hybrid Muse by noting that unlike authors of fiction, the achievements of postcolonial poets have been strangely neglected. In this course we ll consider whether and why that may be changing, focusing on Africana poets from the Caribbean and Africa. We will begin by considering Isidore Okpewho s influential study of oral poetry and myth in Africa, and then move chronologically through a set of weekly readings likely to include Nicolas Guillen (Cuba), Aime Cesaire (Martinique), Leopold Senghor (Senegal), Okpot Bitek (Uganda), Chris Okigbo (Nigeria), Kofi Awoonor (Ghana), Kamau Braithwaite (Trinidad), Derek Walcott (St. Lucia), David Dabydeen (Guyana/UK), Dionne Brand (Trinidad/Canada), Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rico), M. NourbeSe Philip (Tobago/Canada) and Chris Abani (Nigeria/US). Among the broad questions we ll consider are why women s voices appear to be underrepresented, how oral poetic traditions and translation inflect this body of work, the grounds of comparison across African and Caribbean spaces, and the particular contributions of poets who are also critics. The reading list may be adjusted to address interests of seminar members, and prospective students are welcome to send suggestions for particular authors, readings, or units to Tsitsi Jaji. This is an introductory-level graduate class, open to advanced undergraduate majors by permission. No particular background knowledge is expected. Assignments will consist of weekly response papers, an in-class presentation, and a choice of a final conference-style paper (10-12pp) or syllabus.",

The rule of law has developed tremendous moral force in international politics and legal language is becoming a key resource in daily life. The relationship between law and politics is becoming all the more critical in the contemporary period. By asking how relationships between legal, cultural and political realms are structured, we will study changing approaches to law in anthropological work. The course will examine how law provides tools for both social struggle and social control and explores classical and contemporary texts in legal and political anthropology, detailing the cultural dimensions of law and law's changing relationship to discipline.",

In doing so, we will look both at the great diversity in democratic ideals across the continent as well as the perceived failures of many African nations to transition to constitutional democracies. We will use a variety of examples from recent history to examine these issues, such as the recent youth uprising in Egypt and its use of social media as a tool of democracy, the role of youth in apartheid-era political protest in South Africa, and the complex intersection of indigenous politics and democratic legislation in Tanzania.

As a region in which there have been masive transplantations of peoples and their cultures from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and upon which the United States has exerted considerable influence, we will question the processes by which the meeting and mixing of peoples and cultures has occurred. Course readings include material on the political economy of slavery and the plantation system, family and community life, reliious beliefs and practices, gender roles and idiologies, popular culture, and the difdiffering ways national, ethnic, and racial identities are expressed on the islands and throughout the Caribbean diaspora.",

    "course_description" : "An advanced topics course in American literature, with the curriculum fixed by the instructor. In 1963, James Baldwin wrote, the future is going to be worse than the past if we do not let the people who represent us know that it is our country. Hoping to appeal to legislators and readers alike, Baldwins essay, We Can Change the Country captured the insurgent spirit and democratic sensibility that defined the Civil Rights era. While the Civil Rights Movement is remembered as the one of the most significant events in twentieth-century American political and social history, it is rarely regarded, however, as a a turning point in American art and culture. Unlike the Black Arts Movement that fashioned itself as the cultural arm to the Black Power Movement, the idea of a civil rights aesthetics that emerged alongside formal Civil Rights politics has only recently become the subject of academic inquiry. This interdisciplinary course study the emergence of a civil right aesthetic as produced by writers James Baldwin, Frank London Brown, Lorraine Hansberry; musicians like the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, Max Roach, Curtis Mayfield, Nina Simone; actors Harry Belafonte, Diahann Carroll, Abbey Lincoln, and Sidney Poiter; and visual artists and groups such AFRICOBRA, Spiral, Sam Gilliam, Gordon Parks, and Faith Ringold. The goal of this class is also to move past the single artist model to think about how collaboration as artistic practice and political ideal in collectives, friendships, and co-authorship also contributed to Civil Rights aesthetics. Finally, we will examine the the afterlife of this civil aesthetic and how recent retrospectives on these artists, such as the Brooklyn Museums exhibit Witness: Art and Civil Rights in the Sixties, John Legend and The Roots cover album, \"Wake Up!,\" Charles Johnsons novel, \"The Dreamer\" and Rita Doves poetry collection, \"On the Bus With Rosa Parks.\"",

    "course_description" : "This seminar is a sustained, collective engagement with the life and works of W.E.B. Du Bois. In the early years of the twenieth century, Du Bois began to develop an analysis of America's tradition of a scriptive hierachy--the Jim Crow system--in a global context. His repeated evocations of the idea of the color line--in his 1900 speech to the first Pan-African Congress, in the essay \"On The Dawn of Freedom\" in Souls of Black Folk (1903), and in his \"The Color Line Belts the World\" (Collier's, Oct. 20, 1906)--mark the grounds of a challenge of historic importance to dominant American constructions of race, to international relations theory and to develop practice. He continued to deepen this analysis, at significant personal costs, in the ensuing decades. His criticism of racism was relentless, and in the years after World War II he was branded by postwar US administrations as a threat to national security. This towering figure in a vital current black internationalism was subject to harassment. Du Bois died in exile in Ghana. We hope to build the semester's work in significant part around the question of what it means to analyze Du Bolis using the same global view that he brought to the analysis if race in America and that informed his politics of transnational solidarity in defense of peoples' rights.",

While each of these writers has gained a considerable reputation as an American writer whose writing transcents regional distinctions, the South resonates in their voices and mediates their vision. What each writer finally confronts is Southern history as burden and souce, convention and curse. This course will begin by exploring the myths and cultural codes shaping life in the South (particularly after the Civil War). We will then proceed towards an examination of how the writers in the course frame Southern experience, given their differences in race, class, and gender, as they portray lives lived within and across a variety of socially recognized boundaries. Works to be read include Absalom, Absalom. Their Eyes Were Watching God, Uncle Tom's Children, Black Boy, The Wide Net and Other Stories, and Losing Battles. There will also be screenings of the films The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind. Coursework will consist of two critical essays and final group project.

In this course we will look at jazz and the literary representations it engendered in order to understand modern American culture. We will explore a dizzying variety of forms, including autobiography and album liner notes, biography, poetry, fiction, and cinema. We'll examine how race, gender, and class influenced the development of jazz music, and then will use jazz music to develop critical approaches to literary form. Students are not required to have a critical understanding of music. Class will involve visits from musicians and critics, as well as field trips to some of Philadelphias most vibrant jazz venues.

Contemporary homelessness differs significantly from related conditions of destitute poverty during other eras of our nation's history. Advocates, researchers and policymakers have all played key roles in defining the current problem, measuring its prevalence, and designing interventions to reduce it. The first section of this course examines the definitional and measurement issues, and how they affect our understanding of the scale and composition of the problem. Explanations for homelessness have also been varied, and the second part of the course focuses on examining the merits of some of those explanations, and in particular, the role of the affordable housing crisis. The third section of the course focuses on the dynamics of homelessness, combining evidence from ethnographic studies of how people become homeless and experience homelessness, with quantitative research on the patterns of entry and exit from the condition. The final section of the course turns to the approaches taken by policymakers and advocates to address the problem, and considers the efficacy and quandaries associated with various policy strategies. The course concludes by contemplating the future of homelessness research and public policy.",

An African-centered perspective defines self as the collective, for \"I Am Because We Are.\" However, America has historically promoted the individualistic \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, thus we are left with the question of what Africans in America are supposed to believe, and how does this quandry influence our individual and collective identities. Part 1 of the course will focus on identity issues, from how we view ourselves to how our identities change in relationships (family, social). A heavy emphasis will be placed on an African-centered paradigm. The principle objectives of this portion of the course are to have students go through a process of self-analysis and exploration in hopes that they can better understand their powers and weaknesses, their belief systems, and the various roles that they play, while at the same time learning about their peers. The initial phase of the course is key to the second phase which will look at various community issues and research topics. The overall objective of the course will be to have students engage in critical thought on several levels (self, inter-personal, House, community, worldview) and merge this thought into a relevant research topic.",

This course begins not on the page, but in the bardic traditions of Homer's Iliad, which encoded many of the values of its time in oral formulas. Poetry was, however, no mere encyclopedia, but also a source of risk, as we will read in Plato's warning against its hypnotic powers, and in the excesses of The Bacchae. We continue through 19th and 20th century attempts to recover these classic traditions (Wordsworth, Longfellow, Pound). Yet Europe was not the only center of poetic production. How does the Homeric tradition relate to living traditions of West African singing poets (griots) and Southern African praise songs? And what traces of these traditions can we hear in the blues? We will listen to early blues recordings and discuss the politics of collecting folklore, and the genius of African American modernists ( Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Georgia Douglas Johnson) who brought vernacular speech onto the page. We will read and listen to a number of 20th century poets inspired when page meets stage in jazz poetry, dub poetry, spoken word, and hip hop. Assignments will include 2 papers, 2 small-group performances, memorization exercises, and a creative adaptation of one poem.",

Students will be asked to think seriously about how slavery impacted Middle Eastern societies, and how this phenomenon has been studied. The material we will use will draw from historians of the Middle East, the narratives of slave-owners and former slaves, and from the historiography of other fields of study, notably Africana and African Studies. We will also begin to explore the visual culture of slavery, in art, in photography and in film.",

The courseexamines two central sociological concerns: (1) the nature and persistence of racial/ethnic categories, and (2) how these categories relate to systems of social stratification as well as political and economic dynamics. The course will begin with a general overview of the major theories that drive the literature on race and ethnicity. We will then explore the topics of racial and ethnic identity construction, racial ideology, and the impact of race in social stratification systems. In this course we will also cover an important sub-field of the study of race and ethnicity - immigration - by critically exploring theoretical perspectives on assimilation and its variants. This course incorporates both classic studies of race and ethnicity as well as newer research and contemporary debates.",

In this course, we will survey some of the indigenous religions of Africa and examine their nature and their philosophical foundations. We will examine African systems of beliefs, myths, symbols, and rituals, as developed by African societies to express their distinctive worldviews. We will also raise a few general questions about the interrelationship of religion and culture as well as religion and social change in Africa, and the challenges of modern technologies to African beliefs. We will examine the future of African religions and analyze the extent to which African peoples can hold on to their beliefs in this age of rapid technological and scientific development. Emphasis will be on themes rather than on individual national or ethnic religions. Case studies will be limited to West Africa among the Akan of Ghana, the Yoruba of Nigeria and the Mende of Sierra Leone. Questions are provided (a) to guide and direct reading (b) to form the basis for discussions (c) as exercises and (d) for examinations.",

We examine the effects of family decisions about work within the household on gender differences in labor market productivity. Second, we review the economic theories of current discrimination in the labor market. Third, we use data to test how well the various discrimination and non-discrimination theories explain current labor market patterns. Finally, we review the major national policies on labor market discrimination and evaluate their effectiveness in light of the theoretical and empirical evidence amassed throughout the course.",

Among other responsibilities, students focus their community service on college and career readiness at West Philadelphia High School and Sayre High School. Students are typically engaged in academically based community service learning at the schools for two hours each week. A primary goal of the seminar is to help students develop proposals as to how a Penn undergraduate education might better empower students to produce, not simply \"consume,\" societally-useful knowledge, as well as function as caring, contributing citizens of a democratic society.

We will begin with a comparative analysis of the role of material culture during the period of American slavery, by exploring the significance of such items as jewelry, ceremonial costumes, and spiritual artifacts. As the course moves into the modern era, we will consider several questions. What did it mean, for example, for black soldiers to wear uniforms during times of war? What is the role of fashion in music and expressive culture? How do gender ideals and class aspirations shape attitudes about clothing, bodily display, and consumption patterns? Through readings, analyses of visual iconography, class discussions, student presentations, and analytical writing assignments, we will gain a more layered understanding of the role of material culture in inscribing difference and signaling belonging.",

To answer this question, we will consider works by Langston Hughes, Charles Johnson, Ishmael Reed, Percival Everett, as well as the work of black comedians including Richard Pryor, Cedric the Entertainer, Bernie Mac, Dave Chappelle, Patrice O Neal, Wanda Sykes, Key and Peele, and Chris Rock.

Lectures and reading assignments will draw upon a variety of sources, including court cases, artistic renderings, city maps and street plans, travel accounts of visits to the region, and the material, cultural, and intellectual products made possible by the wealth and dynamism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will conclude with an analysis of the Age of Revolutions, a period of dramatic upheaval that remains at the center of lively scholarly debates.

Reaching across various geographical locations,historical periods and theoretical geneologies, our readings will draw from African Diaspora Studies, Anthropology and Gender/Sexuality Studies. We will also look to artistic production throughout the African Diaspora for the significant contributions black artists have made as some of the most exciting theorists of self, sex, spirit and power.",

    "course_description" : "This class will focus on working with the oral tradition as a form of historical, anthropological, religious, and/or literary evidence. In the African American section, we will look closely at one historical incident that took place in the Sea Islands of Georgia. The white slave master wrote that recently arrived Igbo slaves walked into the water and drowned themselves, rather than be enslaved. Dozens of accounts by African Americans, spread over more than 200 years, report that the Igbo flew back to Africa. The class will study archival documents, African American narratives recorded in Drums and Shadows: Survival Studies among the Georgia Coastal Negroes (1940), and Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, a literary account of what the story of the Flying Africans means to Black communities today. The class will research Igbo and Kongo traditions in Africa and the New World in seeking a richly detailed explanation for why so many of those interviewed insist that the story is true. This discussion will bring up theoretical issues of the ethics of interviewing, working with oral and transcribed materials, and the complex question of how to use oral history as evidence in the academy. The Native American section of the course will look at the history of how scholars have handled the oral tradition. As late as the mid-20th century, indigenous wisdom keepers were rendered as nameless \"informants\" on the white page. More recently, some very innovative ethnographic works-Julie Cruickshank's The Social Life of Stories, Linda Tuhiwai Smith's Decolonizing Methodologies, etc.-have been published that foreground the voices of indigenous wisdom keepers as equal or even more important than the scholarly voice. In this section, we will deal with issues of ethics, intellectual property rights, and how to write a scholarly work that emphasizes and fully respects traditional forms of knowledge. Students will be given access to recordings, transcripts, and published works based on these interviews in order to study the entire process of incorporating oral histories and traditions into your own scholarly work.",

The diversity of immigrant and receiving communities means that the dynamics and impacts of migration are varied and complex. This course examines the development of immigrant and receiving communities in the United States. It surveys public policy and community and economic development practices related to migration at the local, regional, national, and trans-national scale. Class readings, discussions, and visits to Philadelphia's immigrant neighborhoods explore themes including labor markets, housing experiences, political mobilization, civil society, cultural preservation, and the built enviornment. The first half of the course surveys migration and community development among a broad range of ehtnic groups in different parts of the city and suburbs, mainly through history, sociology, and geography; the second half focuses on specific policy and community and economic development initiatives. The major class project will be a study of gentrification in Philadelphia's Chinatown with the community organization Asian Americans United, part of a multi-city Chinatown study in collaboration with the Asian Legal Defense and Education Fund and colleagues in Boston and New York. Ultimately, the class aims to provide students with 1) a broad knowledge of immigration and its impacts on cities and regions; 2) an in-depth understanding of urban policies and institutions working on immigration in U.S. cities; and 3) familiarity with community and economic development strategies for migrant and receiving communities.",

This course introduces anthropological theories of culture and multiculuralism and the method of ethnography as these apply to understanding diversity in contemporary life. After learning the basic concepts through reading key texts and writing response papers, students will apply the concepts by (1) writing an ethnic autobrigraphy; (2) critiquing a film or novel with a multicultural theme; and (3) conducting a mini-ethnography of a multicultural choice. These projects are designed to encourage students to reflect on the meaning of multiculturalism from three different angles: personal experience, media representation, and participant observation of diviersity in a multicultural site (which could be at Penn). The goal is to learn about the role and the impacts of diversity in the US vis-a-vis constitutionally guaranteed rights to liberty, equality, and democratic justice.",

During the 20th Century, Black poets have been engaged in a constant struggle for adequate critical attention and public exposure. And despite their use of a variety of styles, techniques, forms, and idioms, African American poetry is often viewed in the narrowest of terms: as angry, as solely protest-oriented, and as anti-white. In this advanced seminar, we will read the works of numerous Black poets, along with essays and interviews highlighting the poetic issues informing their work. Poets studied in the course will include Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Sterling A. Brown, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Hayden, Rita Dove, Michael S. Harper, Lucille Clifton, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Cornelius Eady. There will be class visits from established poets as well as field trips to readings. Coursework will consist of several short papers and a longer seminar paper.",

The types of communication that we will consider include greetings and gossip; verbal art, storytelling, and political speech making; styles of communication between traditional healers and their patients, and between women and men.

The course will also explore the decades of independence with a special eye towards pan-Africanism and pan-Arabism. We will also study the ramifications of the Arab-Israeli conflict on the relationship between African and Middle-Eastern countries, from Uganda to Ethopia, from OPEC to Darfur. This course will pay close attention to migrations through the regions, whether forced or economic or religious. Whenever possible we will explore, through film and literature, how people in Africa and the Middle East see their connections, and their differences.",

We will examine how \"black\" women who live in the United States as novelists, essayists, poets, and playwrights expand notions of race and what it means to be \"African American\" at the very same moment they have become the \"voice\" of modern feminism and global fiction. The course will feature writers like Chimamanda Adichie, Elizabeth Alexander, Edwidge Danticat, Roxane Gay, Ayana Mathis, Maaza Mengiste, Toni Morrison, Lynn Nottage, Suzan-Lori Parks, ZZ Packer, Emily Raboteau, Nelly Rosario, Natasha Trethewey, Jesmyn Ward, and Alice Walker (to name a few).",

Throughout the course, discussions will include legal controversies relevant to social change such as issues of race, gender and the law.

This course introduces the student to public service issues, from the perspective of selected Penn anthropology faculty. Lectures will be given by faculty representing the four fields. With the course coordinator, students will be encouraged to pursue several public interest issues of their choice.

Whatever this field might be, it is more often then not actively produced through a range of conflicting ethical commitments of multiple expert cultures, social movements and laypersons.

Students will engage a number of disciplinary perspectives within the social sciences including the history, sociology, and anthropology of science, and we will pay particular attention to feminist, queer, and postcolonial science studies perspectives. Throughout, we will consider how both global and local cultural transformations have shaped the emergence of this multidisciplinary field of study. To understand the complexity of global health, students will engage with a number of theoretical and ethnographic texts while questioning its stability and coherence as a self-same object given its interdisciplinary character. In doing so, we will explore the ways in which diverse sets of interests converge to constitute as well as contest the ever-shifting boundaries of global health.",

FALL 2014 TOPIC: Songs of Dissent: African American Poetry in the 21st Century The present moment constitutes one of the most exciting periods in the nearly 300-year history of African American poetry. Never before has there been such an incredible range of approaches to form, aesthetics, and subject-matter. This seminar will endeavor both to historicize and contextualize the African American poetic project. We will begin by looking at the issues generated in a single poem and move onward to full-length volumes of works by African American poets. We will move to an examination of several important anthologies, in particular Michael S. Harper and Anthony Walton s Every Shut Eye Ain t Sleep and The Vintage Book of African American Poetry, Arnold Rampersad s Oxford Anthology of African American Poetry, Aldon Nielsen s Every Goodbye Ain t Gone, and Charles H. Rowell s Angle of Ascent, in order to engage issues of periodization, canon-formation, and categorization as modalities that constantly shape our understanding of what constitutes a black poem. In the latter stages of the course, our attention will turn to individual poets, as they manifest a poetic vision through individual volumes of poems and essays on poetics. There will be several guest lectures by visiting poets, as well as class trips to poetry readings in and around Philadelphia.",

We will critically investigate the analytic shift from \"roots\" to \"routes\" as we read widely in the literatures, histories and theories of what Paul Gilroy and Stuart Hal variously describe as the productive inter-culture of the black Atlantic world.",

In-class writing, group discussions, and field work in the Philadelphia area. Fall 2014 Topic: AUGUST WILSON - The people need to know the story. See how they fit into it. See what part they play. - August Wilson, King Hedley II. In this seminar, students will read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's 20th Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traumas, triumphs, and traditions through the decades, told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. Other readings include supporting material on Wilson's work and African American theatre, the works of contemporary playwrights whom Wilson has influenced (such as Suzan-Lori Parks and Tarell Alvin McCraney), and context on Penn's relationship with West Philadelphia. As an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, Writing Out Loud gives students the opportunity to enhance their understanding of the plays, and history and culture that shaped them, by forming meaningful relationships with West Philadelphia residents. Wilson's plays provide the bridge between the two groups. The course culminates with students writing an original theatre piece inspired by the readings and relationships, which they will share at an end-of-semester performance.",

From the rise of transnational religious networks, to controversial legal challenges to religious rights, to state-sponsored trials for religious minorities, the issues remain critical and volatile. In this light, this course explores contemporary issues dealing with the dueling principles of religious freedom set alongside cultural practices and the role of the nation-state in managing, accommodating and disengaging with protections based on religious difference and legal questions. By examining recent and emerging scholarship on religious practices embedded in legal/political/moral controversies, the central goal is to explore the ways that new uses of religion and the law are changing the ways that scholars are engaging these topics. The course will be taught in seminar format and students will engage with the historical, theoretical and ethnographic literature on this topic. Themes will range from formations of secularism and genealogies of religion, debates over freedom and its fictions, and the social construction of law as it relates to dilemmas over pluralism, evidentiary questions and anthropological interrogations of the role of trials.",

We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.",

For the rest of the semester, we will critically read contemporary ethnographies addressing pressing issues such as nationalism, militarism, neoliberalism and fundamentalism. Throughout, we will investigate what it means not only to \"write women's worlds\", but also to analyze broader socio-cultural, political, and economic processes through a gendered lens. We will, finally, address the various ways feminist anthropology fundamentally challenged the discipline's epistemological certainties, as well as how it continues to transform our understanding of the foundations of the modern world.",

This course is designed to introduce students to the theoretical and methodological approaches taken in understanding these behaviors. Analyzing social movements that range from civil discontent to contentious political protest, the course will address a variety of questions: What is the origin of movement behavior and why do individuals turn to these actions in lieu of simply engaging in institutional modes of political action such as voting? What were the strategies of these movements? What are the political conditions that allow social movements to resonate with the American public? In addition to addressing these topics, this course surveys the policy successes of major social and political movements. From the Civil Rights and Women's Right Movement to the recent 2010 Tea Party movement, this course explores the various public policies that have resulted from citizens' protest actions. While state-level and local-level government responsiveness will be addressed, special attention will be given to how political protest influences public policy in all three branches of the federal government.",

How has racial stratification influenced scientists and how have scientists constructed racial difference and helped to maintain or contest racial inequities in society? This seminar draws on an interdisciplinary body of biological and social scientific literature to explore the connections between race, science, and society in the United States from the eighteenth century to the current genomic age. After laying a historical foundation, we will focus on the recent expansion of genomic research and technologies that treat race as a biological category that can be identified at the molecular level, including race-specific pharmaceuticals, commercial ancestry testing, and racial profiling with DNA forensics. We will discuss the significance of this increase in race consciousness in genomic research and technology at a time when colorblindness and post-racialism are gaining popularity. Students will investigate further specific topics related to race, genetics, and biotechnologies in their research papers.",

We will examine the fruits of this activism as well as the consequences of subsequent events for the rise of several important social movements in the latter half of the century -- including civil rights, women's liberation, and gay rights -- in which women played a vital role. The course concludes with an assessment of feminism in the present day, with special emphasis on the responses of younger women to its legacy.",

What do historians gain by approaching the past with an awareness of the body as a material and historically contingent entity? In this course we consider several different ways of imagining historical bodies and the body in history. Our readings will explore how events and new social, racial, economic and political formations influence how contemporaries imagined and described bodies and their capacities. We will also explore whether the body itself might be a dynamic source of historical change. Among the topics we will discuss are: medical theories about bodies, epidemics and their impact; sensory capacities; capacities for physical labor; cultures of violence; reproductive capacities and politics; coerced migration; fashion, beauty, and grace; and the state's interest in mobilizing bodies to serve imperial, economic, and military agendas. This course complements but does not duplicate \"Race and Gender in Comparative Perspective\" offered in Spring 2012. It is an intensive readings course with written assignments: short papers throughout the semester and a synthetic final paper.",

It is intended to introduce a broad range of African artistry, primarily tradition-based but also including contemporary art, and to encourage critical thinking about the cultural construction of the artist in Africa and the West. The first weeks will focus on historiography, examining Modernist constructions of the African artist that accompanied the Western discovery of African art and early studies linking ethnicity to style. We then consider spheres of artistic production, looking at media and techniques and their relation to gender and artistic identity. From there, we examine innovation and creativity within tradition and the role of patronage and the market. Related issues of authorship and biography will frame our discussion of case studies of artist's hands among the Yoruba (Nigeria), Luba (Congo), and other African cultures. We will conclude by looking at issues of artistic identity and representation in modern and contemporary African art. Weekly meetings will be supplemented by visits to museums and galleries, including the Barnes Foundation and the University of Pennsylvania Museum, as well as a lecture by a visiting artist.",

Pivoting around the themes of voice, authenticity and memory, this course considers the methods, theories and archival practices of autobiography, biography and oral history. It builds on the last two decades of scholarship that pair oral history with traditional written archival material-giving particular attention to the methodologies and practices used by African descended women and queer storytellers and listeners. During our discussions, we will consider the ethics between researcher and storyteller while addressing the following questions: How do emotions, performance, and identities (gender, sexuality, race, age, (dis)ability, etc.) inform the stories we tell and collect? How does oral history impact the contemporary construction and narration of history? How does the practice and production of black women's and queer autobiography, biography and oral history inform interdisciplinary research methods and blur narrative genres?",

The globalization of the economy, the spread of communications technology, major migrations between urban locations, increasing disparities between rich and poor, the dramatic growth of the \"culture industries\", and the increasingly popular quest for \"place making\" through urban design have all contributed to this process. This course will examine urban neighborhoods in the United States and elsewhere in the world. In particular, class readings and discussions will explore the wide range of ways (political, social, cultural; organized and informal) that individuals and institutions in urban neighborhoods have reacted to global transformations and what effects and consequences those reactions have precipitated.",

Caribbean musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics, ritual, communication, religion, and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Caribbean contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism, migrations, ethnicity, hybridity, sycretism, and gloalization. Each of these concepts, moreover, will be explored with a view toward understanding its connections to the central analytical paradigm of the course--diaspora. Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music, ranging from calypso to junkanoo, from rumba to merengue, and from dancehall to zouk. We will then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions, but also in relation to our own North-American contexts of music consumptions and production.",

Particular attention will be given to the social and political role of traditional architecture in expressing and shaping ideas about the environment, technology, and identity. The theme will be explored in a series of lectures, readings, discussions, and assignments where architectural history, literature, and anthropology will be interwoven to provide the basis for further interdisciplinary forays into African architecture.",

Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertoires of music and then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relation to our own, North American contexts of music consumption and production.",

We will examine these connections in two ways: 1. how media institutions shaped and shifted notions of race and 2. how different racialized groups used media to construct racial meaning or pursue political objectives. Our discussions will treat race as both a social construct and a lived reality. Case studies will include the construction of ethnic identities through media representations, the role of media in the civil rights movement, and the racial codes of popular culture. Readings and class discussion will emphasize the changing nature of race for different racialized groups, especially African Americans as well as Latinos and Whites. Our definition of media is purposefully broad, covering film, radio, newspapers, music and television. The course will introduce students to radio, newspapers, music and television. The course will introduce students to historical developments, cultural analysis, and critical race theory.",

Using materials such as slave narratives, social criticism, oral histories, and archival sources, this course will explore the theoretical and practical applications of black feminist thought in nineteenth and twentieth century North American culture and politics. In particular, we will consider the symbols and practices (storytelling, myth-making, art, archival research) that black women use to document lives. We will ask: how do these methods of documentation inform our understanding of the past and the production of historical knowledge? We will give particular attention to the concepts such as gender, race, memory, the archive, and embodied knowledge to complicate our understanding of historical documentation, epistemology, and authenticity. The course material will include scholarship by Harriet Jacobs, Audre Lorde, Myriam Chancy, Hazel Carby, Hershini Young, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Toni Morrison, and others.

Such projects include photos, materials originally shot on film stock, and digital images that can be either displayed in a book or magazine, and moving images made into a film or video for a TV show or released for screening in cinemas, or other broadcast mediums like YouTube and Vimeo.",

    "course_description" : "Venus was the God of Beauty and Love yet she was married to Hephaestus, the mangled, grumpy and for all intents and purposes, ugly god. Why juxtapose such distinct figures? Are they doing the same job? The course discusses the interplay between ugliness and politics with focus on a number of central concepts such as race, social conflict, nationalism, ideology, dictatorship, propaganda and autonomy. Emphasis is put on the double role of the deployment of ugliness, as reinforcement of ideological and political ideas and as a force of social criticism. How does the state justify its own existence by the use of aesthetic narratives? How does the State identify undesirables? This class highlights how groups who feel somatically alike behave, and how their boundaries form and change over time. The focus will be interdisciplinary and multi-national, with case studies from past and present. The class will have a digital media focus as we will delve into issues of representation particularly with respect to race. For example, we will delve into the aesthetic discussion of northern and southern Sudanese as well and Hitler's Germany. The aim of the course is to locate ugliness within a larger framework of ethnic conflict and nation building practices. My hope is to extend discussions of ugliness beyond the confines of aesthetics and situate it at the intersection of nationalism, power and citizenship. Beauty and ugliness, so easily relegated to individual preference, are linked indissolubly to gender, power and race relations in nation building projects. As Pierre Bourdieu (1984) observes, nothing is more distinctive, more distinguished, than the capacity to confer aesthetic status on objects that are banal or even 'common'. And these aesthetic distinctions, consciously and deliberately or not, fulfill a social function of legitimating social differences.",

After a consideration of general social movement theory and a discussion of social rights as opposed to more generalized conceptions of human rights, the course moves into a wide range of particular case studies. These movements address issues such as subsistence for individuals and families, gender and women's movements, ethnic identity and cultural rights, the role of religion in social movements. Within the context of the issues noted, some attention will also be given to racial conflict and environmental concerns, as well as to the nature of citizenship and democratization in post conflict societies.",

This course combinesthese narratives of travel and stories of coming of age. At the center of our exploration will the contemporary rise of Study Abroad programs in U.S. universities. We'll place this in historical context as we consider how cross-cultural encounters have been portrayed, with particular attention to authors of color from the U.S. and the global South. No previous travel experience is assumed other than imaginative; this course is open to students, freshman to senior, from all majors -- especially the undeclared. Materials well consider together include selections from Don Quixote (the adventures of a knight errant and his servant in Spain by Miguel Cervantes), James Baldwin (an African American in Switzerland and France), Samuel Selvon (a Trinidadian in the UK), Faith Adiele (a Nigerian-American in Burma), Amitav Ghosh (an Indian in Egypt) and Kiana Davenport (a Hawaiian in France). These readings will be complemented by films including two versions of Around the World in in Eighty Days, The Motorcycle Diaries, Roman Holiday and Touki Bouki.

Central to the readings are themes related to Africa and the making of a science, Africa and the colonial project, postcoloniality and the contemporary imagination, pan-Africanism and the African diaspora, ethnic Identities and religious Formations, modernity and the anthropology of witchcraft, neoliberalism and the postcolonial state. The goal of the course is to explore the founding tenets of anthropological inquiries and methods and to ponder how those developments contributed to anthropological understandings of Africa in the scholarly imagination. By asking why particular questions emerged and how those inquiries were presented, we will explore the social and political contexts in which particular studies emerged and assess the coherence and value of those analyses. Key to the analysis will be an attempt for students to evaluate sources and construct arguments, taking into account different ideological and/or theoretical approaches.",

    "course_description" : "A new field has slowly begun to emerge within the traditional discipline of academic philosophy: African-American Philosophy. \"African American Philosophy\" refers here to conceptually and analytically rigorous philosophical studies of topics closely related to the social, legal, economic, historical, and cultural experiences of US peoples of African descent. The field has appeared in tandem with a striking increase in the number of professionally trained philosophers of African descent holding the Ph.D. in philosophy, and employed as full-time teachers and scholars. A recent estimate puts the number of philosophers of African descent working in the US at about one hundred; and about twenty of these are African-American women. A significant body of scholarship now describes, explains, critiques, and evaluates African American culture, slavery, oppression, discrimination, integration, segregation, equality, gender politics, labor, families, health, mental health, and the significance of race to identity, morality, ethics, politics, democracy, public policy, law, science, technology, the humanities and the arts. This unique lecture course will be a thematic introduction to African American Philosophy since 1960. Weekly topics will be chosen from among these clusters: Slavery, Colonialism, Oppression and Freedom; Segregation, Integration and Equality; Gender, Sex and Sexualities; Reproductive Rights and Responsibilities; Religion and Spiritualism; Rebellion, Protest, Social Movements and Citizenship; Economic Welfare, Labor and Inequality; Violence, Crime and Punishment; Education, Affirmative Action and Diversity; Reparations and Forgiveness; Identities and Stereotypes; Nature, Science and Health; Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health; Pragmatism; Existentialism; and the Sociology of Philosophy. We will read works by Cornell West, Adrian Piper, Charles Mills, Lewis Gordon, Anita Allen, Anthony Appiah, Lucius Outlaw, Naomi Zack, Lawrence Thomas, Bill Lawson, Michele Moody Adams and others. For most undergraduate students, evaluation in the course will be based on a mid-term and final exam with essay and objective components. Advanced students and graduate students enrolled in the course will have an opportunity to write a substantial supervised paper on a topic of their own choosing in lieu of the exams.",

While there is agreement on fundemental principles as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, differences in interpretation remain. A platform for convergence requires the engagement of a number of constituencies, in particular, state and inter-state entities, corporations, civil society and individuals, as well as the mutual reinforcement of their rights and duties.

    "course_description" : "This graduate student course takes a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of African Political Economy. While the course is grounded in the discipline of history, it seeks to prepare students to actively engage with the social sciences, in particular economics, political science and anthropology. The study of Africa's economic past has moved through many different waves, after an initial burst of scholarship, during the 1960s and 1970s, which dealt with questions such as how Africa was integrated into the world economy, and the causes of wealth and prosperity, the field began to grapple with questions of governance in the 1990s. These questions took two forms. The first approach from political science argued that an analysis of the behavior of political institutions held the key to understanding Africa's economic performance, and the second approach coming out of anthropology questioned the legitimacy of the development discourse itself. Within the last ten years economists have returned to the study of Africa's past, borrowing a focus on African states' institutions to tackle long running questions such as why Africa is poorer than other regions of the world. The renewed interest in questions of Africa's long run economic performance has created new spaces for African historians to write economic and political history. It has also made it imperative for historians to investigate the production and nature of the economic facts we possess, in order to better assess what we do and can know about the economic past of Africa. This course seeks to introduce students to the main approaches to the study of political economy in Africa and at the same time to elaborate on the main thematic and temporal topics in pre-colonial, colonial and contemporary African history.",

Your writing will explore Big Questions about the social, emotional, relational and physical structures that affect our children and youth ; your research, interviews, reporting, and experience will discover and share solutions. If we do the job right, we will shine a light on people inour midst creating structures of safety for kids in an era of fear.

Workshopping happens first with student writer colleagues, and then with the real kids in schools, through our partner West Philadelphia Alliance for Children. Reading to children will give studentwriters a chance to hear where children laugh, see where they look scared, or notice when they begin to fidget. Returning with revisions will be a promise fulfilled, and an important marker in the literary life of everyone involved.

Toward this end, the experiences of various African countries covering the various legal traditions will be included. Specific focus will be on laws covering both economic and social relations. This emphasis includes laws of contracts and civil wrongs, land law, law of succession, marriage and divorce and Africa's laws of International Relations, among other laws.

Through a variety of theoretical discussions and case studies, we will discuss issues such as: the relationship of NGOs to governmental institutions, the ethical considerations of humanitarian assistance, the politics of \"development,\" the ebb and flow of international aid money, the intersection of capitalism and NGOs, and the impact of humanitarian projects on local cultural processes. Students will leave this course with not only a better understanding of the complex webs of NGO interventions across the world, but will also cultivate a critical awareness of the potential problems raised by such institutions and their broader networks.",
