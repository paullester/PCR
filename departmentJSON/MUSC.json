Our focus will be vernacular song and poetry from the latethirteenth to early fifteenth centuries, including detailed exploration of some of the following: polytextual motet, music and poetry of Adam de la halle, the Roman de Fauvel, Machaut,Ciconia and some early Dufay. In exploring how late thirteenth-century writers and composers defined themselves as part of a tradition, we will also look back to their 'history' -- to the repertory of troubadour lyrics. The course will place particular emphasis on the ways medieval writers and musicians construed their creations, and the many productive tensions between language and sound; singing and speaking; words and music. We will explore how that concern with etymologies of song played out not only in the lyrics themselves, but also in theoretical writing about song, and in its manuscript representation and codification. Included in our discussions will be writings by Johannes de Grocheio, Philippe de Vitry, Brunetto Latini and Deschamps, and consideration of a range of chansonniers, including the Chansonnier du roi, the Montpellier codex, and the Machuat manuscripts.",

This year, the Museum of Modern Art is mounting its first major Sound Art exhibit (Soundings: A Contemporary Score, 10 August- 3 November.) This seminar will examine some of the many practices that are known as sound art. We will begin our explorations by delving into the field of Sound Studies. Over the semester, we will consider the themes such as the history of noise, nature music and environmental recording, and the relationship between sound art and the history of musical technology. In early October, we will visit MOMA as a class. As part of the seminar, students will be expected to write a research paper and to complete a creative project.",

How can we approach writing about our ethnographic work without silencing the voices of those who should be heard? In what ways might transcription and notation complicate power structures and reinforce our own musical values? What special challenges need to be negotiated in the process of documenting ethnographies on film? How do ethical and economic dilemmas inform our approach to making sound recording? A series of readings in ethnomusicology and anthropology will suggest some answers to these questions--answers that will, in turn, be tested by means of several interconnected fieldwork projects focused on gospel music in West Philadelphia. Our readings and fieldwork experiences will shape our classroom discussions, leading not only to be a better understanding of ethnomusicological methods, but also to a deeper appreciation of the \"shadows\" that we cast in the field.",

We will then work our way through Central and South America, considering norteno, cumbia, vallenato, tango, chamame, and forro. Our journey will conclude in the Caribbean, where we will spend some time thinking about merengue and rake-n-scrape music. Throughout the semester, the musical case studies will be matched by readings and film that afford ample opportunity to think about the ways that music is bound up in ethnicity, identity, and class. We will also have occasion to think about the accordion as a multiply meaningful instrument that continues to be incorporated into debates over cultural politics and mobilized as part of strategies of representation through the New World.

We will explore a dizzying variety of forms, including autobiography and album liner notes, biography, poetry, fiction, and cinema. We'll examine how race, gender, and class influenced the development of jazz music, and then will use jazz music to develop critical approaches to literary form. Students are not required to have a critical understanding of music. Class will involve visits from musicians and critics, as well as field trips to some of Philadelphias most vibrant jazz venues.",

This is a community partnership seminar, which means that all forms of representation are produced in collaboration with community partners in West Philadelphia.

They were sometimes made by the same people, and they were often understood to have the same purpose: to attune individuals to the rhythms, proportions, and harmonies of nature. This seminar draws connections between music, science, politics, ethics and aesthetics between 1750 and 1850, a crucial point in European history. We will examine the role of instruments in conceptions of nature, society, and the individual, traversing the clockwork regularity of the enlightenment, the turbulent longings of Romanticism, and the spooky delirium of the fantastic. The course begins with light refracting through prisms; it ends with the blaring trombones of Berlionz's opium-induced Symphonie Fantatique; along the way we will visit ideas of mimesis, mechanical observation, theories of the passions, global science, demonic virtuosity, phantasmagoria, the uncanny, and the paradoxes of bourgeois selfhood. Students will work with actual instruments, read primary texts, and might meet a 21st century dandy. The class is open to creative undergraduates and graduates from any field who want to explore a range of ideas of what it means to be human in the modern world.",

This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music, and a range of ways of thinking, talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called \"Classical\" repertory, from the medieval period to the present day, including some of the 'greats' such as Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Berlioz, and Verdi, but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon, considering what music has meant for different people, from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves, we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021)",

The course is not a chronological journey, but rather a topical treatment of the various issues in the history of American music. Some of the specific, project-oriented activities of the course will consist of, but will not be limited to the following: (1)participating in the development of a traveling exhibition on the Apollo Theater for the SmithsonianInstitution; (2)development of a permanent website for a history of jazz course at Penn; (3)reviewing two manuscripts for publication to a major press; (4)developing a working proposal for a history of African American music. In this context students will learn the basics of contemporary music criticism, including: identifying a work's significant musical gestures; positioning those gestures within a broader field of musical rhetoric, conventions, and social contracts; and theorizing the conventions with respect to large systems of cultural knowledge, such as historical, geographical contexts as well as the lived experiences of audiences, composers, performers, and dancers. Other topics covered: origin and development of American popular music and gendered and racial aspects of American classical music.",

Latin American musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics, ritual, communication, religion, and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Latin American contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism, migration, ethnicity, and globalization. Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music and then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relation to our own, North American contexts of music consumption and production.

Drawing on a wide range of texts from fiction and poetry to autobiography, musicology, literary criticism and reportage, we will pay particular attention to how music figures as a sign of authenticity in black literature as slavery, the Great Migration of the early 20th century, class mobility and gender identities put pressure on the politics of belonging. Throughout the course the relationship between African American culture and the wider Black Atlantic will remain a crucial concern. We'll begin with the role of music as memory in accounts of remembered Africa songs in autobiographical work by W.E.B. Du Bois, Toni Morrisons Song of Solomon, and a film tracing a mourning song in the Gullah islands of South Carolina to its corollary among the Mende people of Sierra Leone. We'll then spend some time listening to vernacular music (spirituals, work-songs, and blues) and explore the politics of how and why these forms found varying degrees of acceptance, particularly in the milieu of the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro movement. Students need not have an extensive background in musicology, but should be prepared to devot time to weekly listening.",

    "course_description" : "This course examines how we as consumers in the \"Western\" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.",

These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Caribbean contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism, migration, ethnicity, hybridity, syncretism, and globalization. Each of these concepts, moreover, will be explored with a view toward understanding its connections to the central analytical paradigm of the course--diaspora. Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music ranging from calpso to junkanoo, from rumba to merengue, and from dance hall to zouk. We will then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relation to our own North-American contexts of music consumption and production.

Focusing on India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia, the course emphasizes musics from Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Christian traditions; nevertheless, it draws widely to touch upon sacred musics in Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and among some indigenous peoples in the region. Throughout, we explore ontologies of sound; sonic occurrences in religious structures, public processions, and pilgrimage sites; the construction of religion and ritual as ideas forged through colonial encounter and modern scholarship on religion; the politics of sacred sounds in today's public spaces and contemporary media, such as television and online; and the surprising fluidity between popular and sacred musical genres.",

The course will also examine the relationship between entrepreneurship and individual artistic development. After arriving at an appropriate definition of entrepreneurship and how it can apply to music and the arts, students will explore the development of creativity and innovation and how that leads to idea generation. Students will then receive instruction in such areas as marketing, fundraising, financial management, and business planning. Guest lectures and the examination of case studies will supplement the instructor's lectures. The course will culminate with each student completing and presenting an individual project and participating in a group project in which the class partners with a local arts organization.",
