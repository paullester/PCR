    "course_description" : "Through the twentieth century, American culture took on new forms and meanings, spurred by technological innovation, commerce, and institutions, and shaped by an ever-changing population. In the process, American culture became self-consciously 'modern'-embraced, contested, repudiated, and continually redefined. This course explores the history of American culture from the 1890s to the 1990s, with a focus on the following questions: Why did culture become such an important part of American economic, social, and political life in the twentieth century? How has culture been created, understood, and mobilized by different groups in American society at different times? What have been the politics of culture over the twentieth century? Topics include the rise of 'culture industries' and mass entertainment, including amusement parks, film, radio, and television; the growth of consumer culture; the impact of gender in such arenas as sports and fashion; the role of working-class peoples, African Americans, and immigrants in American culture; the cultural response to the Depression and World War II; and popular activism. The course emphasizes the study of primary documents-journalism, fiction, letters and diaries, music, photographs, and film-as a means of understanding the past.",

While following the narrative of politics and economic development,we will pay particular attention to race relations and will be more than casually interested in gender roles. In addition, we will take frequent peeks at the evolving Southern identity as reflected in popular culture and literature as well as in other corners of the public sphere.",

The grand societies and rich states which composed the European state system in 1890 destroyed themselves in these fifty-five years. As many as eighty million Russians, Germans, Poles, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Italians and other Europeans died in slavelabor camps, and six million Jews were systematically murdered. Europe's flourishing Jewish community east of the Rhine was wiped out. On the 9th of May 1945, the day Nazi Germany surrended, the once prosperous continent was a smoking ruin, covered by rubble, pock-marked by craters and full of miserable starving people. This course will try to explain how and why Europe committed suicide in such a horrific way. It will cover Fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, the two world wars, the great economic depression and the Holocaust.",

It ranges from the problems of the industrial revolution in England to problems of building a market economy in eastern Europe today. In particular, it examines industrialization and explores the sources of sustained economic growth from a comparative perspective. Most of the world, especially in so-called emerging economies, is still confronted with the challenge, and often pain, of creating a modern industrial capitalist society. The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law, anti-trust, corporate forms, banking institutions, industrial relations, etc. By definition, the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world, but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed.",

Instead of reading and discussing the required texts according to the date when they were written (first the early traditions and ending with the Renaissance views), we will focus our attention on a few themes that were central concerns to those living in Classic and Renaissance times, and that continue to influence modern ways of thinking and acting in Western societies: conceptions of God and the place of religion in society; nature of power and authority, and individuals' rights and duties; good, evil, and ethical philosophy; views on women, their nature and roles in society; ethnography and the perception of other cultures and societies. In addition to reading and discussing several of the biblical books--Genesis, Exodus, the Book on Revelation--we will study other seminal classical works--Sophocles' Antigone, Aristotle's Politics and Ethics, Herodotus' The Histories; Plato's Apology-- and works by Michel de Montaigne, Maria de Zayas y Sotomayor, Marie de Gournay, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare, and several others. We will also work with books published in the last decades, analyzing the classics and and their reception in various periods of history, but also books that analyze what the classics tell us today--Dreyfus and Kelly's All things shining, Reading the Western Classics to find meaning in a secular Age; Anthony Grafton's Bring Out Your Dead: the Past as Revelation; James Miller, Examined Lives, from Socrates to Nietzsche; and Sarah Bakewell, How to Live: Or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer.",

So we start there and move forward into more contemporary times. In addition to examining the objectives behind foreign assistance and the intentions of donors and recipients, we will look at some of the consequences (intended or unintended) of various forms of foreign aid to Africa over the past century. While not designed to be a comprehensive history of development theory, of African economics, or of international aid organizations, the course will touch on all of these topics.

    "course_description" : "In this course we will read what many consider to be the greatest book in world literature. This work, Tolstoys War and Peace, is devoted to one of the most momentous periods in world history, the Napoleonic Era (1789-1815). We will study both the novel and the era of the Napoleonic Wars: the military campaigns of Napoleon and his opponents, the grand strategies of the age, political intrigues and diplomatic betrayals, the ideologies and human dramas, the relationship between art and history. How does literature help us to understand this era? How does history help us to understand this great novel? This semester marks the 200th anniversary of Napoleons attempt to conquer Russia and achieve world domination, the campaign of 1812. Come celebrate this Bicentennial with us! Because we will read War and Peace over the course of the entire semester, readings will be manageable and very enjoyable.",

This virtual heritage museum provides a collective portrait of families and individuals who have had histories in West Philadelphia and is intended as an ever-revised and expanded resource by and for members of the West Philadelphia community, especially for teachers and their students. The website for the virtual museum was first expanded and updated during hte fall of 2010 by students in an Academically Based Community Service course taught by Professor Walter Licht of the History Department and Mark Lloyd. To be offered as an ABCS course in Fall 2014, it will continue the work of developing the virutal history museum. Students will engage in research projects that contribute to one or more of the following categories: a general history of West Philadelphia, accounts of its neighborhoods and their institutions, a historical economic narrative of the area, a re-photographic survey of area landmarks, and the further collecting and posting to the website of personal and family stories.",

Hop aboard the Indian Ocean dhows, Chinese junks, Dutch schooners, and British and American clipper ships that made possible the rise of global capitalism, new colonial relationships, and the intensified forms of cultural change. How have the desires to possess and consume particular commodities shaped cultures and the course of modern history? This class introduces students to the cultural history of the modern world through an interdisciplinary analysis of connections between East and West, South and North. Following the circulation of commodities and the development of modern capitalism, the course examines the impact of global exchange on interactions and relationships between regions, nations, cultures, and peoples and the influences on cultural practices and meanings. The role of slavery and labor migrations, colonial and imperial relations, and struggles for economic and political independence are also considered. Recitation will not meet every week. Lecture sessions will be shortened those weeks that recitations are held.",

Whether it is Maimonides fleeing Spain to become chief judge in Cairo, Richard the King of England conquering Cyprus but not quite getting to Jerusalem, Marco Polo seeking his fortune but telling his tales from prison in Genoa, a Parisian scholar traveling to Spain to learn the science of the Arabs, a work-a-day Arab businessman trying to get a shipment of cheese from Sicily to Alexandria, or maybe just a black rat carrying the plague, we will be looking at the reasons and ways people and things were on the sea. We will also look at what happened when cultures that mostly ignored each others' existence came into constant contact across and around the Mediterranean.",

Among the topics we will consider are the relationship between public and private life; the historic connections between patriarchy and capitalism; reproduction as a social and cultural as well a biological phenomenon; class, race, ethnicity, and religion as alternative sites of identity; citizenship, legal personhood and contract; the dynamics of empire and conquest; feminism; sexuality; the history of the body; visual culture; postmodernist, poststructuralist, and postfeminist ways of thinking about sex and gender; the current debates about the meaning of marriage; and the challenge presented by transgender lives.

Today, it is in connection to recent processes of economic liberalization, globalization, and the post-Cold War \"triumph of capitalism\" that the vast changes transpiring in these areas of the world are most typically discussed. However, the anticipation of the imminent \"great transformation\" of these parts of the world has a much longer history. As such, it has proven both constitutive of the processes of actual transformation that have been unfolding in these parts of the world since (at least) the second half of the nineteenth century and representative of the multifarious idioms that have historically gone into the making of knowledge about the economic. To Asian subalterns and to the West's high theoretical exponents of classical political economy, to metropolitan romantics and to incipient \"third world\" nationalists, to the early 20th-century's increasingly \"scientific\" economicsts and to its revolutionaries--to one and all the agrarian question in Asia was crucial. For us, it will be the entry point into thinking about the making of economics and the economy in a time before a Post-War era in which each would increasingly become the reflection of the other through a seemingly self-evident relation between object and inquiry and between diagnosing underdevelopment and desireing growth.",

It will ask how poor people in cities manage to survive and what methods social scientists have used to analyze poverty. It will explore the politics of poverty and public and private programs directed toward its reduction. While the main focus of the course is on the United States, attention will be paid, as well, to urban poverty in the Global South, European cities, and to the parallels among the forces generating poverty around the globe as well as to emerging global anti-poverty strategies. Students will be expected to read approximately one book per week, engage in discussion, write short papers, and make a presentation to the class on an anti-poverty initiative.",

This introductory course will trace this history in broad strokes, from pre-colonial times to the near present, focusing most attention on the period from the mineral discoveries of the late 19th century until now. Main themes will include colonial conquest and indigenous resistance, the creation of new racial and national identities, and the rise, life and demise of the aparthied state. Examining large historical processes, (often through the lens of individual lives) by way of novels, films and scholarly readings will enable a broader engagement with issues of race and racism as well as gender and generational conflicts.

    "course_description" : "With its booming economy, the recent inauguration of its first female president, and its selection as host to the 2012 World Cup and Olympic games, Brazil is growing in global prestige. But amid all these exciting developments are devastating socioeconomic inequalities. Access to safe living conditions, livable wages, higher education, and overall social mobility remain painfully out of reach to many Brazilians, the majority of whom are the descendants of slaves. Why do these problems persist in a country that has had such an enduring and widespread reputation as a \"racial democracy\"? What are the possibilities of closing the equality gap in Brazil? To answer these and other questions, our course takes a long and expansive view of Brazilian history. We begin with an exploration of Brazil's early formation as a Portuguese colony in the sixteenth century before moving on to tracing its development as one of the largest and longest-lasting slaveholding societies in the world. From there we will examine the gradual process of abolition in the region, the transition to an independent republic in the nineteenth century, as well as the nation-building projects and political crises of the twentieth century. We will conclude with an analysis of the major issues shaping modern Brazilian soicety and culture.",

The first eight weeks of the semester are taken up with a combination of readings and research planning. The remainder of the semester is given over to the development and projects. Students are expected not only to complete their own projects, but also to participate as consultants in the research of others. Readings will include studies of the relationship between poverty and health, studies of particular diseases and efforts to eradicate them, discussions of gender and health priorities, and debates over the proper balance between economic growth and health initiatives in poor countries. We will also look at searching critiques of the entire development process. James Ferguson, in The Anti-Politics Machine, for example, argues that the role of technical expertise in development planning is to remove fundamental political issues from the democratic process, and to make them technical questions that are outside politics. Students will have the opportunity to shape, develop, and complete their own research projects. Research methods, problems, and results, will be discussed in class all through the semester. This course meets the capstone research requirement in health and societies.",

    "course_description" : "This course concentrates on the economy of Europe in the Early Modern Period, 1450-1750. It was a time of great transition. Europe developed from an agriculturally-based to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture. From subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of goods, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part--some would say the heart--of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. Economic intensification, expansion, globalization, and industrialization are our topics, therefore. Beginning with economic organizations and practices, we will consider how these changed over time and influenced society and culture. The course takes as its point of departure the experience of individual, working men and women: peasants and artisans, merchants and landlords, entrepeneurs and financiers. Yet, it argues outward: from the particular to the general, from the individual to the social, from the local to the global. It will suggest ways in which the economy influenced developments or changes that were not in themselves economic, shaped, and deflected economic life and practice.",

This course also touches upon other important aspects critical to understanding early modern Spain: relationships among Christians, Muslims, and Jews in the Iberian Peninsula; the conquest and colonization of the New World; and early modern debates about Spain's rights to occupy America and the so-called \"destruction of the Indies.\"",

We begin with the Song dynasty transformation: the rise of gentry society and imperial absolutism, the institution of Confucian orthodoxy, the shift of the population and the economic center of gravity to the south, the commercialization of the economy, and change in the relative status of women and men. We then trace China's subsequent political and social history, including the following themes: inner vs. outer court politics; law, government, and society; intellectuals and political dissent; gender, family, and kinship practices; patterns of peasant life and rebellion; traditional foreign relations and first contacts with the West; internal sources of the decline of imperial order.",

    "course_description" : "England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland experienced revolutions in the first half of the seventeenth century that abolished monarchy and hereditary aristocracy, and carried out the first judicial execution of a monarch in European history. England was re-constructed as a republic, then with Scotland became the United Commonwealth of Great Britain, then declined into a military dictatorship, and finally invited the king back. In 1688, however, the Glorious Revolution deposed that king and declared Britain a strictly constitutional monarchy. This course will explore what motivated ordinarily obedient British subjects to take up arms against their rulers. The works of Milton and Marvell, Cromwell, Hobbes and Locke, and many lesser-known writers of diaries, autobiographies, sermons, statutes, and letters will illuminate the issues. The focus will be on how law, politics and religion interacted in the onset of war and defining of settlement, but with an eye to the larger social and cultural setting in which revolutions happened: this is also an era of both witchcraze and scientific revolution, puritanism and the slave trade, the near-destruction of London by fire and plague and its re-birth as the capital of a commercial empire.",

We will look at the roles that slavery and the slave trade played in marking the boundaries of a black Atlantic, and we will pay special attention to the part that people of African descent played both in struggles against slavery in the Americas and in the struggles to define the meanings of freedom and peoplehood there and elsewhere.",

The second half of the course concentrates on the Nazis in power, their use of terror and propaganda, their ideological objective, everyday life in the Third Reich, the possibilities of resistance to the regime.

We will examine the fruits of this activism as well as the consequences of subsequent events for the rise of several important social movements in the latter half of the century -- including civil rights, women's liberation, and gay rights -- in which women played a vital role. The course concludes with an assessment of feminism in the present day, with special emphasis on the responses of younger women to its legacy.",

A primary goal is to place ideas in their social and cultural context, and to investigate why certain beliefs took hold at particular moments. The last century has witnessed dramatic shifts not only in cultural attitudes but also in the groups that have been able to shape them. Thus, we will examine the intellectual production of both elite and popular thinkers: philosophers, social theorists, scientists, and religious leaders as well as journalists, novelists, advertisers, workers, and immigrants. The course requires close readings of a broad array of primary materials, including academic treatises, reform tracts, political speeches, fiction, photographs, and film.",

The course will also explore the decades of independence with a special eye towards pan-Africanism and pan-Arabism. We will also study the ramifications of the Arab-Israeli conflict on the relationship between African and Middle-Eastern countries, from Uganda to Ethiopia, from OPEC to Darfur. The course will pay close attention to migrations through the regions, whether forced or economic or religious. Whenever possible we will explore, through film and literature, how people in Africa and the Middle East see their connections, and their differences.",

From the twelfth century on, the kingdom of England began to exert its power over Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, although English power waxed and waned in these areas between the twelfth and the seventeenth centuries. The Anglo-Norman continental empire of the Plantagenet dynasty also played a large part in shaping the English monarchy, as did the playing out of the Hundred Years War, the internal divisions in fifteenth-century English society, and the rise of the Tudor-Stuart dynasty.",

Human rights have become a source of inspiration to oppressed individuals and groups across the world, the rallying cry for a global civil society, and not least, a controversial source of legitimation for American foreign policy. This seminar asks: how did all this come to be? We will investigate human rights not only as theories embodied in texts, but as practices embedded in specific historical contexts. Are human rights the product of a peculiarly European heritage, of the Enlightenment and protestantism? How did Americans reconcile inalienable rights with the reality of slavery? Did human rights serve as a \"civilizing\" mask for colonialism? Can universal rights be reconciled with genuine cultural diversity? Through case studies and close readings, the seminar will work toward a genealogy of human rights.",

From the familiar narratives about the creation of modern nation-states to the oft-neglected accounts of cultural life, this course surveys the multi-faceted societies of the twentieth-century Middle East. Although inclusive of the military battles and conflicts that have affected the region, this course will move beyond the cliches of war and conflict in the Middle East to show the range of issues and ideas with which intellectuals and governments grappled throughout the century. The cultural politics and economic value of oil as well as the formation of a vibrant literary life will be among the topics covered in the course. By considering illustrative cultural moments that shed light on the political history of the period, this course will adopt a nuanced framework to approach the Arab/Israeli conflict, the history of the Gulf States, the Iran-Iraq War, and U.S. involvement in the region.",

Unlike most English histories of the period, we will also look closely at the other realms of the British Isles, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Readings consist of a textbook with a British scope, and an array of primary sources, some in book form and others (marked with an asterisk on the syllabus) attached to Blackboard or distributed in class. Books are available at the Penn Book Center, except for biographies associated with film critiques. Most of the films noted in the syllabus will be available on PVN; otherwise, they can be viewed at the library or through Netflix. Assignments in square brackets are optional.",

In one respect, the twentieth century was a strange time to become a global empire: it was the period when colonial systems centered in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Turkey collapsed, and new nations emerged throughout Africa and Asia. This class explores the changing strategies of military, economic, and political intervention that the U.S. pursued as colonization lost legitimacy. Within that framework, the class invites students to think about several questions: How did the idea and practice of empire change over the twentieth century? How did the United States relate to new visions of independence emerging in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? How did global interactions both inform and reflect racial ideology in the United States? Finally, how did international affairs transform U.S. politics and social movements?",

The legacy of Medieval Rus is still referenced, often allegorically, in contemporary social and cultural discourse as the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian societies attempt to reconstruct and reinterpret their histories. In this course, students learn that the study of the medieval cultural and political history explains many aspects of modern Russian society, its culture and mentality.",

The course explores this question across the 20th century, focusing on the origins and evolution of transnational organizations and movements. We will analyze a variety of actors above and below the level of the nation-state, from the League of Nations to Amnesty International. At the same time we will pay careful attention to the many countervailing forces that have resisted the process of globalization: various forms of nationalism, local ethnic and religious movements in places as far-flung as Central Africa and Northern Ireland, and struggles over territories and border control from Arizona to Kashmir. We will look at the long history of contention between these opposing trajectories, exploring such topics as Wilsonianism and its reception in Europe and beyond, transnational human rights norms, the environmentalist movement, institutions designed to deal with global threats such as the World Health Organization or the International Atomic Energy Agency, European integration, political Islam, and the War on Terror.",

In the process, Europe asserted a dominant position in world politics, but also sowed the seed for the terrible castrophes of the 20th Century. The course will address this transformation of European diplomacy with special attention to the rivalries between the great powers, the impact of nationalism and emerging mass politics, the interplay between military and economic power, and the relationship between the European powers and the rest of the world.",

Over the course of roughly a hundred years, Europeans have shaped the fates of peoples living beyond the western world, for instance through the impact of two world wars, European colonialism, and the global Cold War. At the same time, European societies 'at home' were not left unaffected by these interactions. Even today, Europeans are facing the legacies of some of these histories in immigration and the politics of religion and secularism for example. The past century also saw a dramatic shift in Europe's position in the world - from dominance to a loss of influence in the shadow of the United States and more recently, China. The course spends significant time covering the histories of world regions other than Europe. It furthermore considers some interactions and exchanges between world regions from a social and cultural point of view. Because the class spans roughtly a century, the content has to remain introductory and general, although a very basic familiarity with 20th-century international history is helpful.",

    "course_description" : "From an empire to a republic, from communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism, reform and revolution, the Nationalist regime, Mao's China, the Cultural Revolution, and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism. We will conclude with a critical review of the concept of \"Greater China\" that takes into account Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora in order to attain a more comprehensive understanding of modern China, however defined, at the end of the last century.",

We will examine African systems of beliefs, myths, symbols, and rituals, as developed by African societies to express their distinctive worldviews. We will also raise some questions about the interrelationship of religion and culture as well as religion and soical change in Africa, and the challenges of modern technologies to African beliefs. We will examine the future of African religions and analyze the extent to which African peoples can hold on to their beliefs in this age of rapid technological and scientific development. Emphasis will be on themes rather than on individual national or tribal religions. Case studies, however, will be limited to West Africa among the Akan of Ghana, the Yoruba of Nigeria, and the Mende of Sierra Leone. Questions are provided (a) to guide and direct reading (b) to form the basis for discussions (c) as exercises and (d) for examinations.",

We will begin by tracing some of the early origins of - and points of contact between - the Indian, Iberian, and African men and women who formed the basis of colonial society. As the course progresses, we will explore the variety of ways in which colonial subjects lived, worked, ate, worshipped, and socialized. Lectures and reading assignments will draw upon a variety of sources, including court cases, artistic renderings, city maps and street plans, travel accounts of visits to the regions, and the material, cultural, and intellectual products made possible by the wealth and dynamism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will conclude with an analysis of the Age of Revolutions, a period of dramatic upheaval that remains at the center of lively scholarly debates. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage the key questions driving these debates, the most important of which, perhaps, is: what is Latin America's colonial legacy?",

This course examines efforts in the United States, Guatemala, Cuba, and Brazil to define and address problems around land, labor, and property; nation, empire, and autonomy; and racism, democracy, and citizenship. In studying the US and Latin America together, the class invites students to explore central themes of both regions' histories as parts of global processes. We will explore exchanges between social movements in the US, Cuba and Africa, for instance, ask how ideas about poverty traversed national borders, and examine the global rise of human rights consciousness. The class, in other words, not only compares national histories but analyzes the relationships between national upheavals and the global significance of events in the hemisphere.",

The mere mention of these terms, or of such close cousins as demonology, sorcery, exorcism, magic, and the witches Sabbath, raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs, patterns of accusation, the general social position of victims, the intensity and timing of witch hunts, and its relation to religious practice, law, language, gender, social marginalization, and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist, The Blair Witch Project, The Crucible, and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.",

African emigres' relations with both their home and host societies will be explored and compared with the experience of other immigrant groups over the past century. Topics include reasons for leaving Africa, patterns of economic and educational adaptation abroad, changes in gender and generational roles, issues of cultural and political identity, and the impact of national immigration policies.",

    "course_description" : "South Korea (\"Korea\" hereafter) has achieved a remarkable economic development during the past half a century. Originally a poor agrarian economy, Korea joined the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a club of 34 wealthy nations, as a second member from Asia after Japan. Furthermore, Korea emerged from an aid-recipient to a donor country. Many developing economies in particular took note, seeking to learn policy lessons from Korea's development experiences. Taught by a former governor of the Bank of Korea, a Penn Econmics Ph.D., this course covers three themes. The first part examines the sources of successes for rapid industrialization with maintaining fair income distributions during the first five decades since Korea's liberation from the Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Government-led development strategy was instrumental to bringing such remarkable socioeconomic achievements. Part II analyzes how Korea overcame major economic crises in the late 1990s and in recent years. Korea recovered more quickly than most of the neighboring economies experiencing crises at the same time. Third, we examine Korea's continued efforts to integrate its economy into the global economy further through, among others, Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with advanced economies such as the United States.",

Although a main focus will be on understanding how the regions we now know as China, Japan, and Korea emergd with their respective identities, the course will also give attention to various groups that are rarely noticed in the contemporary world but are nonetheless historically important, such as the Tibetans, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Manchus.

The course treats twelve of these moments. Each unit begins with a specific primary document, historical figure, image, location, year, or cultural artifact to commence the delving into the American past. Some of these icons are familiar, but the ensuing deciphering will render them as more complicated; some are unfamiliar, but they will emerge as absolutely telling. The course meets each week for two 50-minute team-taught lectures and once recitation session. Course requirements include: in-class midterm and final exams; three short paper assignments; and punctual attendance and participation in recitations.",

Research teams help contribute to the improvement of education on campus and in the community, as well as the improvement of university-community relations. Among other responsibilities, students focus their community service on college and career readiness at West Philadelphia High School and Sayre High School. Students are typically engaged in academically based community service learning at the schools for two hours each week. A primary goal of the seminar is to help students develop proposals as to how a Penn undergraduate education might better empower students to produce, not simply \"consume,\" societally-useful knowledge, as well as function as caring, contributing citizens of a democratic society.
