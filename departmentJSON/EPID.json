Each topic will be presented in detail by stating the model and covering parameter estimation and interpretation, inference, model building, regression diagnostics and assessment of model fit. Finally, we will cover extensions to both models, including models for multinomial data, analysis of matched-pair data, and random effects models. Topics will be illustrated in class with examples, and we will discuss the use of STATA to conduct the analyses.",

Special emphasis is placed on the assessment and use of utilities in these models. A major focus of the course is the application of economic principles to the evaluation of health outcomes. During seminars, students will carry out practical exercises that include problem solving, critically analyzing published articles, and learning to use computer software that facilitates decision and economic analyses.",

A disproportionate number of emerging infectious diseases and recent disease outbreaks in the United States and elsewhere have shared a common characteristic-they affect veterinary as well as human populations. Many are also vector-borne, passing between different species of hosts through insects and other invertebrates. In some cases humans are only 'spillover hosts' whose infection is incidental to the transmission cycle. Interdisciplinary approaches are especially important to control such diseases. As a particular focus of the course, students will learn the tools needed for successful collaborations to address the growing problem of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases.",
