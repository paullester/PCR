Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural, political and socio-economic contexts (painting, mosaic, sculpture, luxury and mass-produced arts in many media from pottery, silverware and jewelry to textiles and ornamental furniture). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors, and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome, further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. The nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters, we discuss the spaces of sanctuary and tomb, house and city, garden and private collection; visits to the Penn Museum.",

Discussions focus especially on several key themes: the aesthetic status of art and the theological role of images; the revival of classical models and visual modes; social rituals such as pilgrimage and crusading; the cult of the Virgin and the status of women in art; and, more generally, the ideology of visual culture across the political and urban landscapes.",

We will become familiar with the architectural traditions of the great cathedrals, revered pilgrimage churches, and reclusive monasteries of western Europe, as well as castles, houses, and other civic structures. We integrate the study of the architecture with the study of medieval culture, exploring the role of pilgrimage, courts and civil authority, religious reform and radicalism, crusading and social violence, and rising urbanism. In this way, we will explore the ways in which the built environment profoundly affected contemporary audiences and shaped medieval life.",

In this seminar, we will review the intellectual history of ethnoarchaeology in North America and Europe, and explore case studies from Greece, the wider Mediterranean, and beyond. Among the topics will be analogy, cross-cultural comparison, experimental archaeology, oral history research, and archaeologically oriented ethnographic fieldwork. Students will create a proposal for ethnoarchaeological fieldwork in their area of interest in NSF or Wenner-Gren format, to be critiqued by the instructor and their peers.",

Study of major monuments, including icons, mosaics, architecture, and ivories provide us with an overview of this rich artistic culture.

Weekly recitation sections focus on selected major issues, such as the relationship of art to the Holy, the uses and abuses of Iconoclasm, and imperial patronage. The course also grapples with the Empire's relationship to other cultures by looking at the impact of the Christian Crusades and Moslem invasions - as well as Byzantium's crucial impact on European art (e.g., in Sicily, Spain).",
