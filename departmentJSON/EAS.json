Like its prerequisite, the course is designed expressly for students of engineering and applied science having a keen interest in technological innovation. Whereas EAS 545 investigates the sequential stages of engineering entrepreneurship from the initial idea through the early growth phase of a startup company, EAS 546 provides hands-on experience in developing a business plan for such a venture. Working in teams, students prepare and present a comprehensive business plan for a high-tech opportunity. The course expands on topics from EAS 545 with more in-depth attention to: industry and marketplace analysis; competitive strategies related to high-tech product/service positioning, marketing, development and operations; and preparation of sound financial plans. Effective written and verbal presentation skills are emphasized throughout the course. Ultimately, each team presents its plan to a distinguished panel of recognized entrepreneurs, investors and advisors from the high-tech industry.",

This seminar is intended for anyone who is interested in thinking about everyday life and its objects and learning about what goes into the design process. We will explore design failures and successes, and learn how attention to the objects in our everday lives and how these were designed changes our perspective toward not only the objects that surround us, but our very lives and culture. Along with readings from Norman and Cooper, readings will also likely be drawn from journals, magazines, newspapers. Students will be expected to write and revise 3 four-to-six page papers, one-page responses, in-class writings and a reading and idea journal. This is a writing seminar--and as such fulfills the entire Writing Requirement for students in all four undergraduate schools.

Though in modern mythology it is a solitary effort by a passionate individual, entrepreneurship is frequently more successful when pursued in an interdisciplinary environment. Though it rarely requires the greatest time investment, concentration of personnel, the majority of the funding or even the greatest depth of expertise to accomplish, excellent product design can be the difference between a successful and failed venture. A poorly designed \"product \"can prevent a venture from being successful. An excellently designed product can make a competent business plan much more successful. A well defined and designed product solution will create differentiation, and can not only meet customer expectation but can create desirability. Through the review and discussion of case studies, lecture subjects, guest lecturers, field trips, and a semester long interdisciplinary team project, this class will provide insight into the problem identification and product design processes, user needs research, intellectual property research, experience design, Industrial Design, Interface Design, brand development and product centric fundraising processes.",

Is the invention feasible? Patentable? How should it be designed and produced? What will it cost? Is there a market? Does the payoff justify the investment? These and similar questions will be answered through a multifaceted process including analysis, experimentation, design, and/or market research. The projects are not \"case studies\", but rather involve real, current intellectual property of potential value to the University. Inventors and specialists from the Center for Technology Transfer will be available to collaborate with the student teams.

The first part of the course is to familiarize students (engineering and liberal arts) with basic legal terminology and concepts in products liability litigation. Actual case studies taken from the literature are used to set the scene and form the foundation for the second part of the course, i.e., corporate product safety requirements, man-machine interface safety considerations and human factors, methodology and techniques for safety audits, failure modes and effects analyses and fault-tree analyses. The use and relationship of warnings to design are considered in depth. Trial procedures and the use of engineers as expert witnesses are also considered.",

A survey of the characteristics and processes of the global ocean. Oceanographic concepts are introduced and developed from their bases in biology, physics, chemistry, and geology. Introduction to Maritime Studies. An interdisciplinary consideration of man's relationship with his marine environment. Included are the political, economic, social, and cultural results of man's use of the sea for scientific research, food, fuel, minerals, energy-efficient transportation, and recreation-taught within the context of maritime history, law, literature, and art. Introduction to Nautical Science. The technologies of operation at sea. Concepts of navigation, naval architecture, ship construction, marine engineering systems, and ship management are taught from their bases in physics and astronomy. The Sea Component-six weeks at sea aboard the oceanographic research vessel R/V Westward with formal study in: Oceanographis Laboratory I. The practice of oceanography at sea. Introduction to the oceanic environment, including its biological, physical, chemical, and geological aspects. Instruction given in operation of oceanographic devices for sampling and measurement.
