Since the nanometer scale is so close to the quantum scale, much of the course deals with an introduction to quantum mechanics but the course also includes discussions in solid-state physics, electricity and magnetism and mechanics. The objective of the course is to teach the physics that an engineering student would need to have in order to do experimental work at the nanometer scale. In addition, this course will prepare the student to take more advanced courses in the Nanotechnology Program.",

Through a personal energy audit, students will be made aware of the extensive role that energy plays in modern life, both directly, through electricity and transportation fuel, and indirectly in the manufacturing of goods they use. The course will cover how that energy is supplied, the anticipated global growth in energy demand, the resource availability and the role of science and technology in meeting that demand in a world concerned about climate change. The roles of conservation, improved efficiency and renewable energy in meeting future demand in a sustainable, environmentally benign way will be covered.",

Although in the same period, energy from renewable sources is projected to more than double to 14% of global supply, 78% of primary energy in 2040 will still come from oil, natural gas and coal. While conventional wisdom is that the world is running out of fossil fuels, technical advances such as deepwater production, directional drilling, hydrofracturing, and the refining of non-conventional crude oil sources has increased the resoure base significantly and there is well over 100 years of reserves of all three fuels. The effect has been most most profound in the United States, where net energy imports are projected to fall from 23% to 12% of consumption between 2010 and 2020, with oil imports falling from 54% to 40% of consumption in the same period. Excellent, highly technical careers are, and will continue to be available to in the fossil fuels industry, with opportunities to influence the direction of industries to reduce their impact on the environment and in particular on climThis course will cover engineering technology in the oil, natural gas and coal from production through end use in transportation, power generation and heat, focus on safety and the potential for reducing environmental impacts.
