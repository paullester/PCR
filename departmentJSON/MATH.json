We then present the theory of linear equations with analytic coefficients, the theories of singular points, indicial roots and asymptotic solutions. We then turn to boundary value problems for second order equations with an emphasis on the eigenfunction expansions associated with self adjoint boundary conditions and the Sturm comparison theory. The remaining time is devoted to topics; for example: Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry, singular boundary value problems, perturbation theory, the Lyapounov-Schmidt theory and the Poincare-Bendixson theorem, the equations of mathematical physics, the calculus of variations, symmetries of ODE's and transformation groups.",

After a summary of the necessary results from measure theory, we will learn the probabist's lexicon (random variables, independence, etc.).

These are approached much as we would approach a great painting or great novel - by introducing the creator, by describing the historical context, and then by considering the work in close detail. There will thus be emphasis on biography and on history, but at the heart of the seminar lies a careful examination of some of the foremost landmarks of mathematics. Topics will span the period from Classical times to the late 19th century. We begin with such masters of Greek mathematics as Hippocrates, Euclid, Archimedes, and Heron. We then move forward to Islamic mathematics and al-Khwarizmi's solution of quadratic equations. Back to renaissance Italy, we tell the story of Cardano and the solution of the cubic. Next we proceed to the 17th century and consider Newton's generalized binomial expansion and the Bernoulli brothers' attacks on the harmonic series. This brings us to a sampler from the great 18th century mathematician Leonhard Euler. We end in the 19th century with Cantor's profound - and, some might say, \"profoundly shocking\" - theory of the infinite. To encourage the widest possible audience, mathematical prerequisites will be kept to a minimum. Students should have had (and enjoyed!) high school algebra and geometry as well as trigonometry and pre-calculus. Knowledge of calculus is not assumed.",

In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis, the Fourier transform, interpolation and approximation of functions, sampling theory, digital filtering and noise analysis.",
