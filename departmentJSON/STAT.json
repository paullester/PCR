The waiver prep course is designed for students who have recently completed a statistics course covering topics through multiple regression. The lectures are intended to remind students of statistical methods once learned but forgotten. Most class time is spent interpreting results of statistical analyses; it is assumed that basic concepts and methods such as hypothesis testing are known but somewhat forgotten. The rapid format of the course makes it very difficult for students who have not studied this material previously to learn it sufficiently well to pass the waiver examination.  Inactive",

With this as a foundation, it will proceed to explore the use of the key statistical methodology known as regression analysis for solving business problems, such as the prediction of future sales and the response of the market to price changes. The use of regression diagnostics and various graphical displays supplement the basic numerical summaries and provides insight into the validity of the models. Specific important topics covered include least squares estimation, residuals and outliers, tests and confidence intervals, correlation and autocorrelation, collinearity, and randomization. The presentation relies upon computer software for most of the needed calculations, and the resulting style focuses on construction of models, interpretation of results, and critical evaluation of assumptions.",
