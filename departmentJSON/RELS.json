Teachers, school administrators, journalists, public policy specialists, social workers, lawyers, and health care professionals all encounter situations in which the religious sensitivities of \"clients\" (students, parents, readers, etc.) affect the ways in which they discharge their duties. This seminar serves as an introduction to the Religion in Public Life concentration within the Master of Liberal Arts Program, which is designed to provide professionals with an understanding of the many historical, social and legal issues that complicate discussions of religion in public situations.",

We shall examine this process during the century and a half following the official Reformations in England, Scotland, Anglo-Ireland, the Gaidhealtachd, and British settlements in North America. Readings will be for the most part recent (and some classic) historical monographs, with a sampling of primary sources including spiritual autobiographies, diaries, church court records, and sermons. Depending on student interest, readings in anthropology of religion and ritual may be added. The course will begin with readings in secondary literature, then turn to primary research. Each participant will produce a short work (ca. 12 pp. - the length of a conference paper) of original research in primary materials. An introduction to paleography will allow you to use scanned or microfilmed manuscript sources as well as early printed works. We meet in a library seminar room in order to incorporate the material history of the early modern religious text (manuscript and print) and print image as well, with the help of our rare books and manuscripts curators.",

    "course_description" : "This course will trace the development of Christian thought (including philosophy, theology, spirituality and mysticism) from the early Scholastic period to early Methodism. Readings will be from both primary and secondary sources. A research paper will be required of each student. Spring 2014: This course will give an overview of the main currents of Western Christian thought from the first age of reform (that is, the Central Middle Ages) through the Reformations of the sixteenth century, to the eve of the Enlightenment. In these centuries, \"Christendom\" underwent an almost constant process of internal and external self-definition. The most striking results of this process were the definitive separation of eastern and western Christianity and the division of the western church into what became known as Protestant and Catholic Christianity. Our focus will be on the changing definitions of Christian culture, including theological formulations (definitions of orthodoxy and heterodoxy), trends of spirituality and mysticism, forms of worship, and gender roles and definitions. Attention will also be given to institutional questions such as ecclesiastical hierarchy, monasticism, scholasticism and the rise of universities, and the changing relationship between the secular and religious worlds. Readings will be from both original and secondary sources. Additional primary sources will be available online, attached to the course Blackboard page. I will supply copies of other readings. Students will write two papers. The first (due Feb. 8) is a 5-7 pp. analysis of a primary source from the class, for which another text may be substituted by permission of the instructor. The second paper, due at the end of the course, should be a more ambitious research paper (at least 10 pp. for undergraduates, longer for graduate students) that includes some aspect of thishistory we did not directly study in class.",

The course will explore this diverse and heterogeneous reality by historicising the term \"Hinduism\". In other words, it will examine Hinduism within the diverse social, cultural and political contexts in which it has been and continues to be enmeshed. From the early Vedic era to contemporary diasporic Hindu communities, the course will provide an introduction to Hinduism as a fluid, multifaceted, heterogeneous reality that has always been shaped by its many historical contexts.",

Beginning with silent films like The Vanishing American and moving forward to contemporary films written, directed, and acted by Native Americans, the class will progress from the study of stereotypical images of Hollywood films to the current era of the Native American Renaissance, which has produced films like Smoke Signals, Whale Rider, and The Fast Runner. Because the course is cross-listed in Religious Studies, English, and Anthropology, we will focus on the power of film to convey dimensions of Native American cultures that are more difficult to appreciate in written accounts. In other words, film is able to convey dimensions of the oral tradition, material culture, and the spiritual significance of the land much more effectively because of the visual and audio components of the medium. The films will be situated in a richly nuanced historical and cultural context in order to provide students with a fuller sense of the Native cultures that that are the subjects of the films studied during the semester.",

In this course, we will survey some of the indigenous religions of Africa and examine their nature and their philosophical foundations. We will examine African systems of beliefs, myths, symbols, and rituals, as developed by African societies to express their distinctive worldviews. We will also raise some questions about the interrelationship of religion and culture as well as religion and soical change in Africa, and the challenges of modern technologies to African beliefs. We will examine the future of African religions and analyze the extent to which African peoples can hold on to their beliefs in this age of rapid technological and scientific development. Emphasis will be on themes rather than on individual national or tribal religions. Case studies, however, will be limited to West Africa among the Akan of Ghana, the Yoruba of Nigeria, and the Mende of Sierra Leone. Questions are provided (a) to guide and direct reading (b) to form the basis for discussions (c) as exercises and (d) for examinations.",

This course is divided into two parts. In the first part of this course, students are introduced to key religious traditions of South Asia, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Sikhism. Students will be encouraged to survey academic works pertaining to, on the one hand, the literature, doctrines, cosmologies, rituals and histories of, and prominent places of worship in, the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim and Sikh religious traditions. On the other hand, the development of South Asia into a distinctive space and spiritual 'homeland' for multi-religious communities. Whilst the first part of the course focuses upon religious traditions autonomously, the subsequent section of the course is thematic and encourages students to make comparisons, and discover sophisticated relationships and dynamic interactions between religious traditions in South Asia. Students are introduced to scholarly writings that are revelatory of the materiality of religious traditions in pre-modern and modern South Asia; everyday forms of piety in South Asia; gender positions in religious traditions; encounters of religious traditions with European colonialism; and, perceptions of the 'other' in pre-modern religious traditions. Herein, students will find multiple sites of resemblances or differences, and cultural negotiations, engagements and contests, within religious traditions in South Asia.",

We will consider issues such as the role of religion in human societies, how religion addresses perennial questions of life and death, and how religious traditions change, evolve, and influence one another. Although this is NOT a primarily an introduction to different religious traditions in sense of a \"world religions\" survey course, students will become acquainted with major teachings of several faith traditions. Our focus, though, will be the big questions: Does religion do more good than harm or is it the other way around? Has the modern emergence of a more secular worldview been an improvement or a diminishment? Can we know or experience who or what \"ultimatereality\" is, or is \"it\" really beyond us? How can we explain the relationship religion, peace, and violence? Is suffering and meaninglessness so pervasive that no traditional concept of a loving and powerful God can be affirmed credibly? What kinds of provocative and perhaps enduring answers have people given to these questions in the past? Has something changed as we've moved from ancient to modern times in terms of our own worldviews, so that the the ways people used to think about God must be radically revised if not abandoned entirely? or are there ways for modern women and men to become or remain religious without ceasing to be modern? The goals of this freshman seminar include: 1. an enhanced working knowledge of some significant elements of religion, especially symbol, doctrine, experience, and systems of cosmic, social and order, as they are manifested in several religious traditions. 2. an enhanced capacity to make critical comparisons among religious traditionsacross time. 3. a greater capacity to analyze and reflect on the meaning of religious beliefs and practices. 4. a greater capacity to read and critically interpret religious and scholarly texts. 5. development of your written and verbal communication skills.",

Specifically, the course will introduce students to the diverse roles that popular religions have come to play on specific South Asian societies. By stepping outside the theological domain of religions, the course will sensitise students to the complex and multifacted entanglements of religious behaviour with other domains of social activity.

By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times, we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions, artistic, architectural, and musical traditions, textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as \"Just-War,\" Women's Rights and Abortion. While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara, Japan or Vietnam, Laos.",

In the first half of the course we will study two books by law professors, one Jewish and the other Christian. Their debate will introduce us to the legal and historical background, and to the continuing challenges of church-state separation in America. The second half of the course will examine the claim that we now live in a \"new religious America,\" one in which the increasing presence of Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims has created a new pluralism and a new set of challenges. We will then consider the argument of one historian that diversity and difference have characterized religious groups in America since at least the l9th century, and that this has resulted in a number of paradoxical social situaitons. Finally, we will close with a brief look at the claim that there exists in America a \"civil religion,\" one that unites all citizens despite their other religious differences.",

In this course, we will trace the history of the interpretation of this text in classical Jewish literature, from early post-Biblical interpretations found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, through Rabbinic midrash, and into the various medieval commentators--Rashi, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Ramban, and still others. While the focus of the course will be on the Akeidah, we will also use this text as a test-case to study the history of how Jews read, and why the interpretations of this story differ so radically. Attention will also be paid to contemporary Christian and Islamic interpretations. All texts will be read in the original Hebrew, and students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts, but no other previous experience in reading these texts is necessary.",

It surveys the beliefs, rituals, and thought of major traditions-Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism-and less well known traditions-Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Shintoism. The focus of the course will be on the lived experience of each tradition, looking at the worldviews, motives and aspirations of religious figures. Further, we will trace historical developments by examining moments of sharing and contestation of religious, political, and social ideas between traditions in order to question their boundaries and integrity. Special emphasis is placed on the role of the visual in each religious culture. As religions often do not draw the same boundaries between the sacred and profane as western traditions do, we will also interrogate the ways we approachthe study of religion and problematize the very study of \"Asian Religions\" and \"World Religions\" in general. This course seeks to foster effective skills and to promote critical and independent inquiry into the ways the sacredhas been and continues to be made, and how the vicissitudes of life are made meaningful in Asia.",

    "course_description" : "This course will introduce students to the modern academic study of the different genres of medieval Jewish literature-- poetry, narrative, interpretation of the Bible, liturgy, historiography, philosophy, sermonic, mystical and pietistic writings. In addition to studying the primary texts, the course will also explore the historical, religious, and cultural contexts in which these texts were first produced and then studied, and the aspects of Jewish historical experience that these texts reflect. The specific topic of the course (eg. Medieval Biblical Interpretation, Kabbalah) will vary from semester to semester. In some cases, the specific topic may also be the work of a specific author, like Maimonides. Primary sources will be read in their original Hebrew. While no previous experience in studying these texts is required, students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts. If there is a question as to whether the course is appropriate for you, please contact the professor.",

In the process, we will explore the ways in which visuality as a process renders the act of seeing into a religious experieence. As such, we will also examine the role of the arts in relation to religion: how does vision affect the understanding and practice of religion,, and what do visual arts tell us about religion in ways that texts of speech cannot? Simultaneously, what does the study of religion tell us about visual art that art history cannot?",

The methodology will be interdisciplinary, drawing upon writings from the fields of health care, anthropology, literature, history, film studies, and religious studies. Students will learn about the the complex interrelationships between traditional knowledge systems' and modern, western conceptions of \"medicine.\" Some examples of this include the Lakota Ghost Dance, Navajo sand paintings, Cherokee protocols regarding sacred knowledge, and Anishinaabe herbal medicine. The readings will include anthropological studies of these forms of \"medicine,\" a history of Indian Health Services, first hand accounts of a female Navajo doctor trained in western medicine who then returned home to practice on the Navajo reservation, studies of historical trauma resulting from the massacre of Lakota at Wounded Knee, and contemporary studies of health care on Indian reservations. Students will be evaluated on the basis of in-class presentations and two research papers. The class will also participate in an ongoing project to develop a Cultural Sensitivities workshop that is being implemented at the Indian Health Care clinic at the Cass Lake Hospital on the Leech Lake Ojibwe reservation.",

The course will cover not only the better known cultures from the area, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, but also some lesser known traditions, such as those of the Hurrians, or of the ancient Mediterranean town of Ugarit. Religion will not be viewed merely as a separate, sealed-off element of the ancient societies, but rather as an element in various cultural contexts, for example the relationship between religion and magic, and the role of religion in politics will be recurring topics in the survey. Background readings for the lectures will be drawn not only from the modern scholarly literature, but also from the words of the ancients themselves in the form of their myths, rituals and liturgies.",

Herder, and G.W.F.Hegel) as well as several who (implicitly or explicitly) have rejected the argument (Max Weber, Michael Oakeshott, Daniel Bell, and Niklas Luhmann). In the second half of the class, we will turn to the American context and explore the way these arguments have played themselves out from the time of the constitutional frames to today. In this part of the class, wew will read and discuss excerpts fromthe Federalist Papers and Tocqueville's Democracy in America, selected presidential speeches, nineteenth- and twentieth-century debates surrounding Manifest Destiny and American Exceptionalism, John Dewey/Richard Rorty's proposal for a religion of democratic \"common faith,\" and the neoconservative case for a civil religion of \"national greatness.\" Along the way we will also have occasion to examine sociological treatments of civil religion by such authors as Emile Durkheim, Robert Bellah, and Seymour Martin Lipset.",

Each semester the theme of the course changes. In recent years themes have included: Magic and Ritual, Art and Material Culture, Texts and Contexts, Manuscript Studies. Fall 2013 Topic: Buddhist repertoires (idiosyncratic and personal assemblages of beliefs, reflections, wonderings, possessions, and practices) for a large part, material and sensual. Buddhists are often sustained by their collection, production, and trading of stuff amulets, images, posters, protective drawings, CDs, calendars, films, comic books, and even Buddhist-themed pillow cases, umbrellas, and coffee mugs. Aspirations are interconnected with objects. Beliefs are articulated through objects. Objects are not empty signifiers onto which meaning is placed. The followers and the objects, the collectors and their stuff, are overlooked in the study of religion, even in many studies in the growing field of material culture and religion. What is striking is that these objects of everyday religiosity are often overlooked by art historians as well. Art historians often remove (through photography or physical movement to museums or shops) images and ritual implements from their ritual context and are seen as objets d'art. While art historians influenced by Alfred Gell, Arjun Appadurai, and Daniel Miller have brought the study of ritual objects into the forefront of art historical studies, in terms of methodologies of studying Buddhist art, art historians have generally relegated themselves to the study of either the old and valuable or the static and the curated. This course aims to 1) bring a discussion of art into the study of living Buddhism. Art historians have primarily concentrated on the study of images, stupas, manuscripts, and murals produced by the elite, and primarily made before the twentieth century; 2) study art as it exists and operates in dynamic ritual activities and highly complex synchronic and diachronic relationships; 3) focus on the historical and material turn in the study of images, amulets, and murals in Buddhist monasteries and shrines.",

This course examines women's lives in Muslim societies by paying particular attention to the ways women establish their religious authority, to spaces, networks and institutions that shape the construction of religious authority, to the impact of colonialism, imperialism and nation-state on women's lives, and to the forces of globalization and the emergence of women's movements that had a transformative impact on female religious authority.",

Sufi philosophies, liturgical practices, and social organizations have been a major part of the Islamic tradition in all historical periods, and Sufism has also served as a primary muse behind Islamic aesthetic expression in poetry, music, and the visual arts. In this course, we will explore the various significations of Sufism by addressing both the world of ideas and socio-cultural practices. The course is divided into three broad sections: central themes and concepts going back to the earliest individuals who identified themselves as Sufis; Sufi metaphysics and epistemology as exemplified in the work of Ibn al-'Arabi and his school, and literary expressions as exemplified in the epic poem Layla and Majnun by Nizami, The Conference of the Birds by Attar, and in the life and poetry of Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi. In studying this material, we will be concerned equally with establishing common patterns and seeing how being a Sufi has meant different things to various people over the course of history.",

And how is that this small Galilean and Judean movement came to shape world history and Western culture, even to this day? This course will explore these questions through a focus on the formation of the New Testament - from the letters of Paul in the early first century CE, to the collection and closure of the canon of Christian Scriptures in the fourth century CE.\"",

However, each participant will need to be fully committed intellectually and participate in the monastic rules in the course involving restrictions on dress, technology, verbal communication, and food. The course subject matter is about ways in which nuns, monks, shamens, and swamis in various religious traditions (Buddhist, Muslim, Catholic, Jain, Taoist, Hindu, Animist, among others) have used poetry, meditation, mind-altering chemicals, exercise, magic, and self-torture to cope with pain and suffering, as well as struggle with spiritual, ethical, and metaphysical questions concerning the nature of the soul, the afterlife, and reality. Through monastic and spiritual practice, this course hopes to provide students with an opportunity to struggle with these questions themselves.",

How have Islam, Judaism, and Christianity influenced each other in these regions historically? How have Jews, Christians, and Muslims fared as religious minorities? To what extent have communal relations been characterized by harmony and cooperation, or by strife and discord, and how have these relations changed in diffferent contexts over time? To what extent and under what circumstances have members of these communities converted, intermarried, formed business alliances, and adopted or developed similar customs? How has the emergence of the modern nation-state system affected communal relations as well as the legal or social status of religious minorities in particular countries? How important has religion been as one variable in social identity (along with sect, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.), and to what extent has religious identity figured into regional conflicts and wars? The focus of the class will be on the modern period (c. 1800-present) although we will read about some relevant trends in the early and middle Islamic periods as well. Students will also pursue individually tailored research to produce final papers.",

This course is divided into two parts. In the first part of this course, students are introduced to key religious traditions of South Asia, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Sikhism. Students will be encouraged to survey academic works pertaining to, on the one hand, the literature, doctrines, cosmologies, rituals and histories of, and prominent places of worship in, the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim and Sikh religious traditions. On the other hand, the development of South Asia into a distinctive space and spiritual 'homeland' for multi-religious communities. Whilst the first part of the course focuses upon religious traditions autonomously, the subsequent section of the course is thematic and encourages students to make comparisons, and discover sophisticated relationships and dynamic interactions between religious traditions in South Asia. Students are introduced to scholarly writings that are revelatory of the materiality of religious traditions in pre-modern and modern South Asia; everyday forms of piety in South Asia; gender positions in religious traditions; encounters of religious traditions with European colonialism; and, perceptions of the 'other' in pre-modern religious traditions. Herein, students will find multiple sites of resemblances or differences, and cultural negotiations, engagements and contests, within religious traditions in South Asia.",

    "course_description" : "Islam reached South Asia in the eighth century and Muslim rulers held sway over large parts of the Subcontinent for much of the period from the late 12th century until the colonial period. However, the majority of the population never converted to Islam, and since independence in 1947 Islam--its interpretation, relization, and influence--has been a major factor underlying many difficult political issues. This has been true not only in the largest country, India, where Muslims form 12% (unevenly distributed) of the population, but in Bangladesh and Pakistan where non-Muslims are relatively insignificant minorities. This course explores the realities and the perceptions related to Muslim identities and the Islamic heritage in the subcontinent, and sets it in global context by comparison with other parts of the world which share various aspects of the South Asian experience. The course will conclude with an assessment of the larger significance--social, economic and political, as well as cult ural--of Islam in South Asia today.",

Can its importance to our thinking be honored in a manner that honors too the diversity of outlooks that characterizes our society and its commitment to freedom of conscience? What are the implications of religiously-grounded values for our thinking about disputed issues of public policy? What is the difference, if any, between religious and secular sources of values? We will encounter and reflect on the significance of the greatly heightened diversity of religious thinking in our contemporary society; the similarities as well as the differences between religions; the differences as well as the commonalities that exist within a specific religion; and the differences in the way we go about arriving at, and testing, our moral judgments, in personal life and in approaching questions of This is not a course on the law of the First Amendment, or the role of courts in religious-freedom cases, although it may affect our understanding of some of the controversies that have arisen there.",

In their search for an answer to this question, people tell stories-- stories about the creation of the world, about great human beings confronted with the mysteries of existence, about what happens to people after death. To explore the role of stories in finding meaning in life, we will focus on some of the most meaningful stories ever composed: the biblical stories of Adam and Eve, Abraham and his family, the Exodus, Job and his friends, and the life and death of Jesus. One of our goals is to try to retrieve the original meaning of these narratives, what their authors intended, but we will also explore what they have come to mean for readers in our own day for believers and skeptics, scientists and artists, fundamentalists and feminists.",

Islam in this region has centuries- long presence and a rich variety of traditions and practices. The aim of this course is to show that Islam in various parts of this larger region - Central Asia, North Caucasus and Transcaucasia, the Crimea, the Kazakh steppe and the Volga-Ural region was not a homogenous, static, and dogmatic creed. Rather, it presents a variety of Muslim identities and practices shaped by specific religious institutions within the context of their particular interaction with the state. The Russian imperial rule made Islam function in a qualitatively different environment, provided a new context for mutual impact of Muslim peoples on each other, transformed old and created new religious institutions which led to religious change. We will analyze Islamic institutions and their relations with state structures as well as the impact this interaction had on the religious authority of the ulama, Islamic law and society.",

Beginning with important questions of sexual identity, politics, religion and the individual in contemporary life, we will examine questions of eroticism, sex and love as they are reflected in religious literature, art and history. The concept of divine love and religious devotion will be explored in relation to acts of violence, including human sacrifice and self-sacrifice in the form of martyrdom seen in pre-modern concepts of saintly martyrdom and religious chivalry as well as the religious legitimacy of modern self-sacrifice of soldiers in war and terrorist suicides. The course focuses in particular on examples drawn fromChristianity, Hinduism, Islam and Mesoamerican Religion, although discussions of contemporary issues will be conducted with a broader sweep. Important questions considered in this course include: how does the body function as the locus in which religion is enacted? What is the conflict between our agency over our bodies and socioreligious claims over the individual? Is violence an integral part of religion? What are religious understandings of the relationship between love and sex? How can a human being love gods erotically?",

Imperial, colonial and modern states in different geographies had a transformative impact on the practice of shari'a, replacing the traditional order and institutions in which sharia formed and developed with the new ones. In different contexts, intervention and pressure of states produced different outcomes for the communities and for those who represented traditional legal authority. We will analyze legal developments in various geographies with a focus on both state policies and local responses. We will also look at how Muslims understood shari'a in the twentieth century, how they employed it as ideology and how they tried to rethink its relevance in the contemporary time.",

    "course_description" : "Spring 2013 Topic: Religion, State, and Society in East Asia. This course examines the relationship between religious institutions and the state in East Asia. Focusing on China and Japan, we will learn about the impact of religious ideas, practices, and organizations on social, political and economic processes and inspect the role of religion in the consolidation of individual, communal, and national identity. Adopting a comparative and transnational approach, we will examine the impact of Asian religious traditions: Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and Shinto, as well as global religions such as Islam and Christianity, on the internal sociopolitical structure of the Chinese and Japanese states and their role in shaping power relations on the international level. The class will follow a linear chronological line divided into three separate units. The first unit will cover the emergence of the dominant religious traditions and sociopolitical structures in premodern China and Japan. This unit will set the tone for our main discussion of the relationship between religion and the state in the modern and contemporary periods. The second unit begins with the impact of Christianity on the political cultures of East Asia and concludes with the fate of the empires of China and Japan in the early 20thcentury. The third and final unit will focus on the emergence of new religious movements in postwar Japan and the continuing discourse on state control over religion in the PRC and Taiwan. In addition to covering material from the assigned chapters from the textbook and other secondary sources in greater depth, we will also dedicate our class sessions to close readings of primary historical sources, from imperial edicts and philosophical and religious essays to news interviews and documentary footage. No previous knowledge of Chinese or Japanese is necessary, and all readings will be available in English on the blackboard site in PDF form.",

These performances form a significant part of the epic tradition as they connect the stories in the epics with material realities of the Indian religious and cultural life. The course investigates the role played by the two epics, especially the Ramayana, in the Indian political discourse in both the past and the present. Beyond India, their historical birthplace, these epics traveled to South East Asian regions such as Indonesia and Malaysia. We will also consider the ways in which the traditions in these regions are similar or dissimilar to those in India. Lastly, the students will study the role of the media such as television shows, cinema,and comic books in the manifestation of these epics in popular imagination.",

This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of: Muslim institutions and spaces in pre-colonial South Asia, the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Islam, and the development of Urdu as an Islamic idiom. The second and main part of this course introduces students to academic literature concerning sophisticated encounters between the Muslim elite in north India and modern political and technological developments. The intimate interactions of the 'Mullah' and the 'Englishman' from the 19th to 20th century will thus be revealed to students. This part focuses upon, on the one hand, the role of Islam and pious Muslims in the colonial army, and on the other hand, Muslim initiatives to educate an Islamic 'modernism', 'traditionalism', 'fundamentalism' and 'Sufism', and appropriate print technologies for the creation of public spheres.

By looking at both sacred and everyday objects like rosaries melted in atomic blasts, magical amulets used in healing rituals, temple murals defaced by invading armies, manuscript stained by hold water, we will explore the many ways people express their spiritual aspirations and existential fears through objects. Not only will a different object from a variety of religious traditions be examined each week (eleven in total), but we will also explore different methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of religion. Psychological, phenomenological, bio-genetic, sociological, art historical, discursive, post-modern, and narrative approaches will be discussed.",

    "course_description" : "Spring 2013 Topic: Magic and Sorcery in Medieval Jewish and Christian Cultures Magical beliefs, practices, and texts were widespread in Europe during the Middle Ages, forming an important, but often overlooked, aspect of contemporary Jewish and Christian cultures. In this seminar, we will explore the historical evidence for Christian and Jewish magical traditions, including their sources and development, the integration of magic into diverse aspects of medieval culture, and the condemnation and persecution of those accused of sorcery. In exploring these traditions, we will pay special attention to the points of intersection between Christian and Jewish magic, which will help us understand different forms of interactions and relations between medieval Christians and Jews. Students in this seminar will learn to read medieval treatises of magic as products of a particular time and place, to recognize the particular rationality underlying magical beliefs, and to assess the relationship between magic, science, and religion in medieval thought. No prior background is necessary, and all readings will be in English. Katelyn Mesler (Ph.D. in Religious Studies, Northwestern University) is a historian of medieval Europe, with particular interests in Jewish-Christian relations, the history of science and medicine, magical beliefs and practices, apocalyptic thought, mysticism, heretical movements, and angelology. Her research has taken her to manuscript collections throughout the U.S., Italy, France, England, and Israel, where she has investigated unpublished texts and discovered long-lost sources. This year, Katelyn is a fellow at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies; afterwards, she will begin a research fellowship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.",

    "course_description" : "This course introduces students to Islam in modern South Asia, with a particular focus on the development of 'new' Muslim religious idioms, orientations, pedagogies and movements in 19th and 20th century South Asia. This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of: Muslim institutions and spaces in pre-colonial South Asia, the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Islam, and the development of Urdu as an Islamic idiom. The second and main part of this course introduces students to academic literature concerning sophisticated encounters between the Muslim elite in north India and modern political and technological developments. The intimate interactions of the 'Mullah' and the 'Englishman' from the 19th to 20th century will thus be revealed to students. This part focuses upon, on the one hand, the role of Islam and pious Muslims in the colonial army, and on the other hand, Muslim initiatives to educate an Islamic 'modernism', 'traditionalism', 'fundamentalism' and 'Sufism', and appropriate print technologies for the creation of public spheres. Students will be introduced to historical scholarship revelatory of how these Muslim pedagogies and print initiatives were based upon sophisticated transcultural networks and exchange. In the third part of this course, students will be encouraged to engage with contemporary literature on South Asian Muslim political philosophy and nationalism, and the transcultural intellectual exchanges that produced key Muslim political ideologies.",
