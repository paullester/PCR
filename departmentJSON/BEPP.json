    "course_description" : "This course introduces students to \"managerial economics,\" the application of microeconomic theory to management problems. Microeconomic theory is a highly useful set of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. Our goal in this course is to help you understand this body of theory so you can analyze private and public management problems in an economic framework. This is a \"tools\" course, but we will discuss many business applications and offer a strong emphasis on prescription, as opposed to description. For example, we will focus on profit maximization as a management objective rather than simply a foregone conclusion. The term begins with a brief introduction of the theory of supply and demand underlyng the competitive market model, the benchmark for evaluating other market structures similar to those encountered by real-world firms including monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. We then move to build an understnading of the development and use of market power, and strategic interaction among firms. Last, we examine market failures including asymmetric information and externalities.",

Practical examples will be extremely diverse and include the Silicon Valley and attempts to copy it, the Tennessee Valley Authority, housing restrictions in developing countries such as Brazil, congestion pricing in London, etc. Students will be expected to actively participate and make presentations. The course emphasizes the importance of the economic context, the understanding of the underlying rationale for policies, and how the private agents respond to public incentives. The main learning goals are the following: be able to use simple empirical tools of economic evaluations, be able to articulate a critical analysis of competing viewpoints and assessments, and be able to integrate various analytic steps into an overall assessment of economic policies that relies on sound principles and is well argued.",

We will also examine policy tools such as risk communication, incentive systems, third party inspection, insurance and regulation in different problem contexts. The problem contexts for studying the interactions between analysis, perceptions, and communication will include risk-induced stigmatization of products (e.g. alar, British beef), places (e.g. Love Canal), and technologies (e.g. nuclear power); the siting of noxious facilities, radon, managing catastrophic risks including those from terrorism.

The objectives are to learn some game theory and to learn how game theory can inform managerial decision-making. Students will discover how to model a strategic situation as a game and how to solve a variety of games including those with sequential interaction, repeated play, and private information. These game-theoretic tools will be extensively applied to business strategy as we examine investment and entry, pricing (for products that are durable and have switching costs or network effects), price-matching guarantees, when it is better to follow than lead, managerial incentive contracts, entry deterrence, product location, and two-sided markets. These business strategy issues will be explored in the context of many real-world settings including the markets for cigarettes, cookies, wholesale power generation, video games, supermarkets, and chemicals. Some of the general takeaways from teh course are the value of fewer options, commitment, reputation, and signaling. The presentation of most concepts will be complemented with in-class experiments which provide students first-hand experience for the forces at play in strategic situatons.",

The course aims to train students to do applied economic research that involves measuring effects of theoretical or practical interest. It proceeds in two major parts. The first part examines endogeneity and inference about causal relationships, instrumental variables methods and critiques, and panel data methods. The second part of the course addresses 'structural' econometric modeling. Topics covered in this part include sorting and selection, entry models, and counterfactual analyses of policy changes. The course proceeds by analyzing, in detail, approximately 24 well-known empirical research papers in applied economics or related fields. These include public economics and tax policy, labor economics, law and economics, health care policy, industrial organization and competition, transportation demand and policy, and others.",

Particular attention is paid to the role of formal (constitutional) and informal (non-constitutional) institutions as they determine policy outcomes in democratic societies, including majoritarian (first-past-the-post) and proportional representation systems of elections, partisan (party) and non-partisan (special interest) legislatures, executive agenda-setting and veto powers, federal and unitary forms of governance, and finally, the role of judicial review. Policy applications will focus on fiscal policy (taxes, spending, and debt), though students should feel free to apply the analysis to other public policies of interest. Students should have a firm understanding of micro-economic theory and applied econometrics.",

The redefinition of boundaries between the public and private sectors creates new and exciting opportunities for businesses and policy makers. This course will review the international experience with privatization -- the Thatcher privatizations of the 1980s, the current sale of utilities, airlines, and telecommunication companies in emerging and developed economies. We will analyze the ongoing transformation of post Communist countries. Students will learn how to value state-owned assets using real option value techniques. We will discuss bidding strategies in privatization auctions.

This course focuses on understanding the drivers of risk contagion and ways to restore confidence in worldwide markets for pure and financial risk. The class begins with an evaluaton of recent financial and pure risk events: for example, the sovereign debt crisis, Japanese earthquake, and BP Deepwater Horizon. We explore how these events are being financed in innovative ways via the capital and insurance markets. Next we emphasize the role of risk management in the preservaton and creation of value, helping firms identify, measure, monitor and manage/finance risk. Doing so results in risk-adjusted returns (or return on risk-adjusted capital) that exceed the cost of capital. We devote substantial focus on the practical implementation of effective risk management/financing, given evolving regulatory and governance standards. In addition, we explore opportunities for corporate growth as well as public/private partnerships. The course will conclude with a discussion of emerging markets and the role of risk management in developing a middle class needing new forms of risk transfer/financing.",

    "course_description" : "The increased frequency and severity of pure risk events hinders corporations' abilities to execute strategy and deliver sustainable financial results to stakeholders. Prominent recent examples include disruptions from Hurricane Katrina, Japan's earthquake/nuclear disaster/supply chain breakdowns, Thai floods, U.S. wildfires, and global terrorist attacks. At the same time, both industrialized and emerging economies understand that the management and financing of pure risk is critical to the success of their economies. Consequently, the rising demand for risk capital has ushered in several capital market innovations and public/private partnerships necessary for managing and financing pure risk. This course investigates these issues, beginning with an introduction to pure risks, their centers of gravity and global consequences for corporations, consumers, and the macroeconomies. Next we move on to traditional sources of risk capital provided to corporations and governments via insurance and reinsurance mechanisms. The course concludes with a discussion of new sources of risk capital provided by capital markets including catastrophic risk bonds, securitization of mortality and liability risk, and other forms of insurance-linked securities. Our focus is on the supply of risk capital to corporations and economies, recognizing the unique position of emerging economies in this nexus. Throughout, the class emphasizes current real-world cases to illustrate the competitive differences in strategies taken by hedge funds, private equity pools, and insurers, as they address the increasing need for risk capital around the world. This course complements BEPP 811, Risk and Crisis Management, which focuses on how firms can use various types of hedging instruments to manage pure risks (that is BEPP811's emphasis is primarily on the demand side of markets for pure risks whereas BEPP 812 examines the supply side of these markets). However, BEPP 811 is not required as a prerequisite. Format: Lecture and discussion, midterm and final.",

We focus on pure risks that are relevant for individuals and firms, such as mortality and health-related expenses, property damage, product liability, and employee benefits (e.g. pensions). The course examines a common set of techniques that can be used by individuals and managers in dealing with risk, including risk assumption, prevention, diversification, and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms.

Education, health care, charitable services, and the arts are some primary examples of these. Nonprofit organizations operate in service of specific social missions rather than profit maximization, but in order to serve those missions effectively while ensuring their own survival, they must also make many of the decisions typically associated with private firms. That is, they must compete for funding, human resources, and consumers of their services, they must manage and invest their resources efficiently, and they must innovate new products and services over time. Importantly, the latter requirements may at times come in conflict with the organizations' social values. As a result, nonprofit organizations as economic decision-makers confront a number of unique challenges to their success and growth. The goal of this course is to give students a broad overview of the economic, organizational, and strategic concerns facing the non-profit sector. Our objective is to characterize the unique economic environment, identify effective strategic governance, and management approaches, and explore how appropriate measurement techniques can can inform the policy treatment of nonprofits. This course is organized around a number of lectures, readings and outside speakers, a midterm exam and a required project.",

In the last 60 years practitioners and academics have deliberately engineered the rules of an increasing number of markets, with classic examples including medical resident matching (e.g., NRMP), spectrum auctions (e.g., FCC auctions), and organ donation exchanges. In the last few years, very large markets have been created from scratch, such as eBay, Adwords, and smaller markets like odesk.com and sittercity.com. These designs use a broad set of tools, including economic theory, empirical analysis and experiments (and a fair dose of trial-and-error). With this experience, useful principles have emerged, on what market failures typically have to be addressed, and on which rules work and which do not.",

    "course_description" : "Behavioral economics applies insights from psychology to the study of economic phenomena. This course will take the possibility of deviations from rational, self-interested behavior as a starting point, and explore two main questions: How does psychology play out in markets, where sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers and firms interact and compete? And what does behavioral economics imply for public policy? Markets have the potential to protect consumers from their biases, when firms compete to give biased consumers the best deal. In addition, markets allow for the emergence of informational intermediaries that give biased consumers advice. We will examine whether and how this remedy is provided in a diverse array of markets. Behavioral economics also affects what governments should do and what governments actually do, when they address market failures, combat poverty and inequality, and raise revenue. This course therefore also explores \"Behavioral Public Finance\" -- optimal policy in the presence of biases -- and \"Behavioral Political Economy\" -- how biases affect the choices of politicians and regulators themselves.",
