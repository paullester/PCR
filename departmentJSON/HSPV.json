Recognizing that historical areas are complex entities where cultural and socio-economic realities, land use, building types, and the legal and institutional setting are all closely interrelated, the main focus of the studio is understanding the cultural significance of the built environmentand the relation of this significance to other economic social, political, and aesthetic values . Through the documentation and analysis of a selected study area, the studio undertakes planning exercises for an historical area, carries out documentation and historical research, and creates policies and projects. The studio seeks to demonstrate how, through careful evaluation of problems and potentials, preservation planning can respond to common conflicts between the conservation of cultural and architectural values and the pressure of social forces, economic interest, and politics. The studio focuses on a specific area in need of comprehensive preservation effort, most often in Philadelphia proper. Students work in consultation with local preservation and planning groups, community representatives, and faculty advisors to research and analyze the study area, define major preservation planning problems and opportunities, formulate actions.",

    "course_description" : "Architectural surface finishes are among the most transformative and ephemeral materials in the built environment. They offer insight into architectural alterations, imbue buildings with meaning, influence the expression of design, and transform colorand light. They imitate, fool the eye, and function as disinfectants, insecticides and waterproofing. Given their nature, historic finishes are most often found buried beneath layers of paint and require microscopical analysis to determine their composition and color. The first half of the course will address the technology, analysis, deterioration, and treatment of historic finishes. In addition to lectures andlaboratory exercises, students will have the opportunity to apply new skills toa case study. Metals in a wide range of forms, finishes and colors have been used for architecture and its embellishment, and for monumental sculpture. In architectural context metal is considered a modern material, however, metals have been found associated with buildings since the third millennium BCE. By the first millennium CE, metals were used in the Mediterranean and also in India, China and Japan for buildings and monuments. 18th century English development of iron frame architecture allowed the development of the modern curtain wall. The course continues the introduction to material science and characterization of these metals - copper, iron, aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, titanium. It will survey traditional technologies for extraction, processing, forming, joining and finishing. A review of basic metallurgy, the mechanisms of corrosion and other aspects of deterioration, is followed by training in condition assessment, a survey of preventative strategies and the range of conservation treatment methods. The course will meet at the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and includes a tour of outdoor sites. There is the opportunity for a metal forging workshop or a visit to a metal casting foundry.",

    "course_description" : "Spring 2015 - HSPV-703-301 - Topical Seminar: Germantown - Staff. This seminar/studio hybrid explores urgent preservation and planning issues facing Philadelphia's Germantown neighborhood. Germantown has the largest concentration of historic buildings and landscapes outside of the city's core. But the word \"concentration\" is itself misleading: beyond the densely built-up spine of Germantown Avenue, the area is defined by large lots and old trees -- the very qualities that lured villa-builders there 200 years ago and suburban developers ever since. Contemporary development pressuresare increasing dramatically; dealing with them robustly will require clear analyses of historic-resource patterns, zoning and planning structures, and community capacities. This course lays the groundwork for that effort, merging advocacy with analysis, resulting in recommendations for planning and preservation measures to improve the quality of life in Germantown without sacrificing its historic values and character. Students from varied PennDesign departments are welcome. Faculty for this course will include several preservation and planningprofessionals with significant experience in Germantown, advised by Prof. Wunsch. Spring 2015 - HSPV-703-302 - Topical Seminar: Memorials and Memorialization - Instructors - Ken Lum and Randall F. Mason. The functions, meanings, images, designs and politics of memorials are an urgent issue in contemporary society. Memorials and memorialization processes occupy a central place in culture and and public space, and concentrate some of the most interesting and fraught design, artistic and interpretive questions facing designers, artists and scholars today. This seminar, limited to 12 students from a variety of departments, will explore discourse and practices of memorialization. The focus of our critical inquiry will be the powerful connections between art, design, memory and culture as embodied and represented in memorials and memorialization processes. Particular topics will include controversies regarding tragedy memorials, changing discourses around public art, and the status of ephemeral/popular memorials. The course will be led by Randy Mason in collaboration with Ken Lum, Professor of Fine Arts. Together, they and the class will explore the literature from both heritage/social-science/history perspectives and art/design perspectives. Class sessions may include field trips, exercises, projects and guest lectures.",

The fundamental assumption of the course is that the preservation professional must understand the capabilities and deficiencies of this network in order to be effective. The course will look at a range of relevant and exemplary laws and policies existing at all levels of government, examining them through case studies and field exercises.",

The organization, while broadly chronological, emphasizes themes around which important scholarship has gathered. The central purpose is to acquaint you with major cultural, economic, technological, and environmental forces that have shaped buildings and settlements in North America for the last 400 years. To that end, we will study a mix of \"high-style\" and \"vernacular\" architectures while encouraging you to think critically about these categories. Throughout the semester, you will be asked to grapple with both the content of assigned readings (the subject) and the manner in which authors present their arguments (the method). Louis Sullivan, for instance, gives us the tall office building \"artistically considered\" while Carol Willis presents it as a financial and legal artifact. What do you make of the difference? Finally, you will learn how to describe buildings. While mastery of architectural vocabulary is a necessary part of that endeavor, it is only a starting point. Rich or \"thick\" description is more than accurate prose. It is integral to understanding the built environment - indeed, to seeing it at all.",

We will explore various forms of documentation, discussing each in terms of its nature, especially the motives for its creation and some ways it might find effective use. Philadelphia is more our laboratory than a primary focus in terms of content, as the city is extremely rich institutions that hold over three centuries of such materials, and students will find here both an exposure to primary documents of most of the species they might find elsewhere, as well as a sense of the culture of such institutions and the kinds of research strategies that can be most effective.",

We will begin by examining the theoretical literature on what constitutes a therapeutic landscape, whether the concept can be applied beyond a specific era, and what it does and doesn't explain. Attending to differences as well as connections, we'll study the rise of penitentiaries, asylums, hospitals and cemeteries as physical environments, keeping in mind the productive tension between their idealistic origins and sometimes-dystopic realizations. \"Landscape\" in its broadest sense will be our focus: not simply buildings, siting, circulation, and planting and but the cultural significance of these elements. Moving into the post- Civil War era, we'll investigate the way therapeutic impulses migrated into other types, e.g. college campuses, even as they lost some of their antebellum coherence. The last third of the course will bring us through the 20th c. It will examine postwar institutional landscape design, notably that ocorporate office parks, and, in the last week, discuss what has become of the therapeutic landscapes with which we began.",

    "course_description" : "Archaeological sites and landscapes have long been considered places of historical and cultural significance and symbols of national and ethnic identity. More recently they have offered new opportunities for economic and touristic development in both urban and rural settings. With a unique set of physical conditions including fragmentation, illegibility, environmental exposure and material deterioration as well as limited and often conflicted use value, their conservation, management, and interpretation as heritage places require special knowledge and methodologies. This seminar will address the history, theories, and realities of the preservation and display of archaeological sites and landscapes. The course will draw from a wide range of published material and experiences representing both national and international contexts. Topics will include site and landscape documentation and recording; site formation and degradation; intervention strategies including interpretation, display, and exhibits; and legislation, policy, and contemporary issues of descendent community ownership. The course is organized as a seminar incorporating readings, lectures, and discussions focused on major themes. Readings have been selected to provide exposure to seminal works in the development of theory and method as well as current expressions of contemporary practice. The first half of the course will be devoted to the history and theory of site and landscape conservation globally with a focus on those aspects that define and distinguish archaeological sites and landscapes from other heritage places. The second half of the course will allow student working groups to define and identify seminal readings and projects related to key issues: site display, tourism and development, risk and threat, public interaction, etc. This work will provide the backdrop for an international colloquium of invited speakers in spring 2014, co-partnered with the Getty Conservation Institute. The course will draw its participants from across the departments of the School of Design and the School of Arts and Sciences to create a truly cross-disciplinary body of talent.",

    "course_description" : "Conservation Praxis is an intensive 4 week summer course designed for architectural conservation and site management majors that builds on the core curriculum and the first year conservation and site management courses. The syllabus is organized around project fieldwork supplemented by lectures, demonstrations, exercises, and site visits that will allow students to experience firsthand the design and construction of vernacular buildings and the application of traditional craft to preserve them. Through a partnership with Grand Tetons National Park, students will engage in the recording, survey, and treatment of selected sites under the supervision of Penn and guest faculty and professional consultants. For Summer 2014, the course will be based in Mancos, CO and Grand Tetons National Park, WY. Bar BC Dude Ranch, the oldest extant dude ranch in America, will be the site of the field work. Bar BC Ranch displays a broad range of technical and interpretive problems related to the ranch's original design, construction and use. Plans are currently underway to stabilize, interpret, and reuse these structures by NPS. The course will also examine preservation issues of the area's rich rural and park heritage with visits to other sites in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. One month shared accommodation with breakfast and all ground transportation will be provided. Weekday dinner will be a communal event and prepared by a cook. Weekends (Saturday and Sunday) are on your own. Dinners will require an additional fee of $300 paid in advance. Travel from Philadelphia to Durango (approx. $500 airfare) and lunch will be each student's responsibility. Students are requested to bring laptops, cameras, sleeping bags and all personal items (toiletries, etc.)",

The course will be conducted over three weeks in the early summer and will have two distinct components: The first part of the course will be held in Philadelphia over three days between May 27-30. It will focus on readings, lectures, discussions about planning in general, applied to the U.S. Randy Mason will lead this part of the course. The third day will be devoted to introducing information on Chinese planning systems and issues of Chinese urbanism. The second part of the course will take place in China and will be led by Donovan Rypkema and Caroline Cheng. Lasting approximately two weeks, the course's China praxis component will center on a project applying the UNESCO Historic Urban Landscape protocol to the mid-sized city of Hongjiang. Our partner in this project is the UNESCO regional research center WHITRAP, led by Ron van Oers and located at Tongji University's College of Architecture and Urban Planning in Shaghai. The extensive field work in Hongjiang will be preceded by 304 days of orientation, lectures, tours and workshops in Shaghai, taking advantage of WHITRP and CAUP expertise.",

    "course_description" : "Time, like space, is all around us. Its evidence is visible in the natural world as physical change. In our own fabricated material works, time exerts its presence through the tell-tale signs of stylistic and technological anachronism and material degradation. It is through these indicators that we confront time indirectly and attempt to position a thing or place in relation to the present. How buildings and landscapes are received by each generation depends on the specific conditions of time and place. Built works, be they barns or bridges, gardens or corn fields, palaces or pit houses, all reflect something of their maker and user as well as the prevailing social and cultural norms. Such trajectories are dependent on many diverse factors; however once consciously examined, all creative works under consideration for their ability to communicate to us; to have relevance in ways consistent or new to their original authorship and to contemporary society. In our efforts to relate to buildings and places from the past, we use time as the primary measure from the present and historical narrative to describe what we know. As a form of material culture, buildings and landscapes are made and modified both consciously and unconsciously, directly and indirectly, thus reflecting individual and societal forces at play. Since the physical fabric and its evidences of alteration present one primary mode of inquiry, archaeological theory and methodology provide an excellent means to recover, read, and interpret that evidence in association with documentary and archival sources. This course will examine the theories and techniques necessary to investigate the morphological evolution of a structure and its physical setting. Students will learn and apply methods relevant to the reading of physical fabric as demonstrated and applied to a case site. The coursework assumes a knowledge of the core curriculum in historic preservation and is therefore recommended for advanced (i.e. second year) students.",
