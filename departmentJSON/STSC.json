In so doing, the course also explores the specific histories of botany, medicine, telegraphy, agronomy, anthropologu, physics and statistics. While attending to the specific people, practices and ideas involved in these sciences in the colonies, the course is also interested in locating specific colonial histories within the larger history of science.",

In this course, we explore the history of informtion technology and its role in contemporary society. We will explore both the technologies themselves--from telephones to computers to video games--as well as their larger social, economic and political context.

Do different technolgoeis produce or result from different economic systems like feudalism, capitalism and communism? Can specific technologies promote democratic or authoritarian politics? Do they suggest or enforce different patterns of race, class or gender relations?

Today's healing practices in these regions grew out of the interaction between the medical traditions of the colonized and those of the European colonizers. We therefore explore the nature of the interactions. What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? What were the effects of colonial racial and gender hierarchies on medical practice? How did practitioners of \"non-Western\" medicine carve out places for themselves? How did they redefine ancient traditions? How did patients find their way among multiple therapeutic traditions? How does biomedicine take a different shape when it is practiced under conditions of poverty, or of inequalities in power? How do today's medical problems grow out of this history? This is a fascinating history of race and gender, of pathogens and conquerors, of science and the body. It tells about the historical and regional roots of today's problems in international medicine.",

But Poe also engaged with the most serious issues faced by his period, from politics and philosphy to industralization and science. His works dealt with these concerns in a variety of ways, while reflecting all along about the conditions of literature in a newly commercialized marketplace. This seminar will look at Poe's literary innovations through the lens of the developing technology and science of the early republic. It will examine the political importance of new institutions for research and diffusion as well as various emerging venues for popular science, including the journals in which Poe wrote as an early science reporter. The course thus explores the peculiar situtation of science and technology in the early USA, at the same time as it reveals the varied and complex literary production of Poe in a new and revealing light.",

    "course_description" : "Victor Frankenstein created a monster. But he didn't make it out of nothing: he found body parts in operation rooms and graves, sewed them together, and invested the new whole with life following scripts laid down by thinkers both ancient and new. Likewise, in creating Frankenstein, one of the greatest novels of all time, Mary Shelley put together elements from gothic fiction, moral and political philosophy, romantic poetry and contemporary science. What were the books that Victor Frankenstein read? What ideas animated Shelley's act of creation? in this seminar we will read from the primary texts that made up Frankenstein and Shelley's libraries, along with closely related works from this period, ranging from Renaissance magic, modern electrochemistry and physiology, through to Rousseau, Smith, Milton, Poe and Balzac. These readings will bring to life a crucial monment in the history of the West--after the French Revolution and at the start of the industrial age--which will give us perspective on today's anxieties about technology and science.",

In the process, we will compare Chinese experience to other cultures and evaluate the status and dynamics of Chinese traditions in the modern era of Western political and scientific dominance. No prior knowledge of Chinese history is assumed. Class discussion will be a part of each meeting.",

This course will examine the many elements that went into the transition, including the revolution in cosmology, the revolt against ancient natural philosophy, the rise of experimentalism, the new philosophies of inquiry, new social structures for natural inquiry and the conceptual foundations of classical physics.\"",

But beyond such practical concern, scientists in both the United States and the Soviet Union had to confront the question of what it meant to pursue natural knowledge in a militarized state. No nation or politcal system could survive without the weapons, medicine, foodstuffs, and consumer producers made possible by modern scientific research--yet science was supposedly an international system free from the dicates of politics.

The course has two principal goals: (1)to give students a practical introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of the history of medicine, and (2)to foster a nuanced, critical understanding of medicine's complex role in contemporary society. The couse takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient,the physician,and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to \"treat\" healthy people as well as the sick and infirm. Rather than history \"from the top down\"or \"from the bottom up,\"this course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means, first, that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriously,on their own terms, rather than judging them by todays's standards. Required readings consist largely of primary sources, from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments will encourge students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras.",

First,we will trace encounters with new landscapes as white settlers migrated from the eastern shores to the priaries to the Rockies. We will examine their efforts to map and categorize nature and to control working landscapes. Second, we will examine changing theories of race, from scientific justicfications of slavery and theories of Indian decline to the construction of 'whiteness'and the spread of eugenices. Finally, we will examine the interaction between scientific knowledge and forms of military and industrial production, from the development of industrial gunpowder, to the making of the Atomic bomb, to the building of the \"gun belt\" across the Southern states. Throughout the course we will also take advantage of our location at the heart of early American Science, using Philadelphia's rich museums and collections of scientific instruments, specimens, and rare texts to illuminate major themes.",

We have insufficient time to treat all human sciences equally.

But the strength of appeals to the past is not a constant: historical experience has at some times and in some places been seen as irrelevant to practical action. Today, in the United States as well as in many other parts of the world, appeals to historical precedent carry considerable weight, and are made for many purposes. For example, the dissolution of Yugoslavia, has been explained as a result of centuries-old ethic tensions, yet when Yugoslavia was created at the end of World War I, objections were countered with the anthropological judgment that the new nation's ethnic divisions were not really significant. Or consider the debate over the ownership of the bones of so-called \"Kennewick Man,\" which pitted Native Amerians against scientists over questions of identity and legal claims. Or, historical generalizations in biology over the value of Darwin's theory, resulting in political debates in local and school board elections and presidential contests. This course will discuss the uses of history in contemporary and past situations, drawing examples from the United States, Europe, the Midfle East, and Africa.",

This course traces the interaction of Americans and the natural world in, studying how Americans changes the natural environment over time, in order to understand why environmental change occurred and occurred in the manner it did. What have Americans believed about the nature of the nation's nature, and what attidues and policies have followed from these ideas? After surveying American environmental history from the 17th to the 20th century, we will examine specific topics and problems in the long relationship between Americans and their environment.

We begin by investigating the contested term itself, paying close attention to critics and activists who deplore the very idea that we should try to sustain our, in their eyes, dystopian present, one marked by environmental catastrophe as well as by an assault on the educational ideals long embodied in the humanities. We then turn to classic humanist texts on utopia, beginning with More's fictive island of 1517. The \"origins of environmentalism\" lie in such depictions of island edens (Richard Grove), and our course proceeds to analyze classic utopian tests from American, English, and German literatures. Readings extend to utopian visions from Europe and America of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as literary and visual texts that deal with contemporary nuclear and flood catastrophes. Authors include: Bill McKibben, Jill Kerr Conway, Christopher Newfield, Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Karl Marx, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Owens, William Morris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ayn Rand, Christa Wolf, and others.",

To begin with the course understands 'supraterritoriality' as the key feature of globalization and proceeds to interrogate the myriad ways in which this supraterritoriality was produced, consumed, used an dabused within the theraeutic cultures that have been, and on occasion still are, available inSouth Asia-both in reality and symbolically. Each week, through a specific case study, framed by a few theoretical readings, we will attempt to deepen and problematize the simple definition of globalization with which we start the course. Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on combining case study-based empirical material and theoretical interventions in Cultural Theory and Postcolonial Studies.",

What roles do the senses and the material objects they observe play in production of science, and how has that changed historically? Are the senses reliable and standardizeable, and if so, how can we talk about them with a common vocabulary? Are some more important than others? We will begin to answer those questions historically, following the role of the senses in science from the early modern period up to the present. We will look at ways in which vision was constructed as the primary sense during the Englightenment and at ways in whivch it was made objective and instrumentalized in the modern period. We will also look at objects themselves. How do museum displays, illustrations jarred specimens, photographs, and movies make and convey knowledge of the natural world?",

Topics of this course will include, but are not limited to, cell development and stem cell biology, wich form the basis of the emerging field of Regenerative Medicine. Penn students will reinforce their learning of these concepts by mentoring high school students, demonstrations by Penn scientists, and a co-teaching method involvimng Penn faculty and a partnering high school teacher. A primary goal of this course is to expose both Penn and high school students to cutting edge science and its societal impact. Through this course Penn students will learn critical skills that can help them bring scientific ideas to professionals, and important to any educated professional.",

Becuse of their success, these developments played an important role in forming our views of how to effectively generate knowledge of the natural world. This course will examine some of the major developments in the physical sciences during the 19th and 20th century, asking how that knowledge and the means by which it was produced related to institutions, technical practices and broader cultural knowledge and knowledge production to explore how past practices have, or have not, left their traces in later science. The course will meet twice a week for lecture and discussion. Readings will consist of Pursuing Power and Light: Technology and Physics from James Watt to Albert Einstein by Bruce J. Hunt When Physics Became King by Iwan Rhys Morus Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist by Russel McCormmach as well as articles from a course reader.
