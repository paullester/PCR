It begins with a discussion of the ideals of convergence and completeness in metric spaces and then uses these ideas to develop the Banach fixed-point theorem and its applications to linear equations, differential equations and integral equations. The course moves on to a study of normed spaces, vector spaces, and Banach spaces and operators defined on vector spaces, as well as functional defined between vector spaces and fields. The course then moves to the study of inner product spaces, Hilbert spaces, orthogonal complements, direct sums, and orthonormal sets. Applications include the study of Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre, and Chebyshev polynomials, and approximation methods in normed spaces. The course then concludes with a study of eigenvalues and eigenspaces of linear operators and spectral theory in finite-dimensional vector spaces.",

In the past, mathematics was learned only through theoretical means. In today's computer age, students are now able to enjoy mathematics through experimental means. Using numerous computer projects, the student will discover many properties of discrete dynamical systems. In addition, the student will also get to understand the mathematics behind the beautiful images created by fractals.

Illustrative examples are used to motivate mathematical topics including ordinary and partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, eigenvalue problems, and stability analysis. Analytical techniques that yield exact solutions to problems are developed when possible, but in many cases, numerical calculations are employed using programs such as Matlab and Maple. Students will learn the importance of mathematics in engineering.",
