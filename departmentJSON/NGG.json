Topics are selected based on excitement surrounding recent research developments. Each topic is analyzed initially at the behavioral level, followed by the systems and the cell and molecular levels. Throughout the course, attention is paid to the analysis interesting stereotyped behaviors, e.g., bird song, lordosis, licking, whose description and neurology has provided insights into the neural systems that contribute to overall neural control of behavior. Attention is also paid to the development of understanding of the neuroanatomy of selected neural systems.",

How do we transform these decisions into actions? How do we improve the execution of the actions themselves? Most importantly, from a neuroscience perspective, how does our brain do it? These are some of the fundamental questions in neuroscience. The Advanced Systems Neuroscience course explores these questions with two focuses: 1) what are our current best guesses? 2) what are the strategies/techniques used in systems neuroscience that have proven successful in improving our guesses? The course will follow a general sensory-decisionmaking motor theme, with lectures, presentations of research articles by students and presentations of experiment proposals by students. Lectures by faculty members will review leading hypotheses in particular topics and illustrate key experiments/results that support those hypotheses; paper presentations by students will facilitate more detailed understanding of how studies were constructed and how results were obtained and interpreted; experiment proposals by students (with faculty mentors) will serve as exercisesfor the students to develop critical skills in designing experiments and writing proposals.",

The first part of each lecture (1/2 hour to 1 hour) will be devoted to a discussion of the disease in question and the second part will consist of one or two student presentations (in lieu of a paper or exam) reviewing in depth one critical neuroscience component of the disease. Each student will work with the course director or an assigned faculty member to develop her/his lecture. On Thursday afternoons, a faculty member will present a research seminar or chalk talk describing the research she or he is conducting in that particular disease. Papers will be provided before the seminar so the students will be familiar with the research. It is expected that having a research seminar given after the introductory lecture will allow the students to become familiar in depth with at least one approach to each disease.",

During the last 20-30 minutes, faculty will introduce methods, concepts, background and information pertinent to the paper that will be discussed at the following meeting. Topics for Spring 2014 will include: 1) Neural specification, diversification and the use of Stem Cells for neural replacement and repair, 2) Axon guidance at the midline and regenerationin spinal cord, 3) Neuronal tiling, self-avoidance and Wallerian degeneration, 4) Development of olfactory circuits and 5) Synapse formation, positioning and synaptic partner choice.
