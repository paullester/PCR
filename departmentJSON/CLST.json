    "course_description" : "By shortly after 1200 B.C., the great Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age had all been destroyed, ushering in a period of demographic instability and political decentralization in Greece, in which most of the material and social aspects of Mycenaean palatial life disappeared. The period from ca. 1200800 B.C. has typically been viewed as a Dark Age, a time of retrenchment and a return to simple farming and pastoralism in small, isolated communities. In recent years this view of a relatively complete cultural and material break has been challenged by investigations at a number of sites on the Greek mainland and islands and beyond. With a basic theme of continuity and change, this course attempts to present a more balanced picture of Greek life from the demise of the palaces to the 8th century renaissance in Greece. Language, religion, social and political organization, economy, and long-distance contacts are explored, as is the relevance of the Homeric epics to this period.",

    "course_description" : "Mythos and Logos are often perceived as representing two opposite approaches toreality: the former tending towards an irrational, sometimes even superstitiousone, the latter to a systematically rational one. This division arose already in Ancient Greece, where the rationalism of figures such as the Sophists castedaway the ancient mythological stories along with the religious practices and beliefs to favor a more pragmatic view of things. Yet, are Mythos and Logos really to be so drastically separated? In Plato's works Mythos and Logos are not presented as two completely separated concepts. On the contrary Plato often uses myths to clarify his ideas and more than that to express the inexpressible. In this course we will examine how the myths and the Mythos are used in Plato's philosophy as a means to express through language what is beyond language and can barely be grasped by human thought. One of the three weekly meetings of the seminar will take place at University City High School (UCHS). We will work closely with a high school class and their teacher at UCHS, using Plato as a springboard for discovery and discussion. Such a format would surely please Socrates himself, who held that ongoing dialogue with others consitutes the truest philosophical enterprise.",

In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we will undertake a literary and archaeological and historical study of Troy and Greecefrom the 13th century B.C., the earliest time conjectured for the Trojan War, down to the 7th century B.C., the latest possible date for composition. In addition to studying the two Homeric epics, we will do comparative reading in other early Greek literatureand the Hebrew Bible.",

Ignored by ancient critics, they were until fairly recently dismissed by classical scholars as mere popular entertainment. But these narratives had an enormous influence on the later development of the novel, and their sophistication and playfulness, they often seem peculiarly modern--or even postmodern. They are also an important source for any understanding of ancient culture or society. In this course, we will discuss the social, religious and philosophical contexts for the ancient novel, and we will think about the relationship of the novel to other ancient genres, such as history and epic. Texts to be read will include Lucian's parodic science fiction story about a journey to the moon; Longus' touching pastoral romance about young love and sexual awakening; Heliodorus' gripping and exotic thriller about pirates and long-lost children; Apuleius' Golden Ass, which contains the story of Cupid and Psyche; and Petronius' Satyricon, a hilarious evocation of an orgiasic Roman banquet.",

    "course_description" : "Athens in the 5th century BC witnesses a cultural flowering of extraordinary power and importance for Western culture. In this class we will examine the achievements of Athens in its Golden Age, beginning with the Persian Wars, seminal events that saw the Greeks defeat the numerically superior Persians. In the generation that followed, Athens rapidly transformed the alliance of Greek states dedicated to taking the war back to Persia into an Aegean empire, dominated b y the Athenians and their fleet. At the same time, this dramatic in power and prestige was accompanied by the growth of full participatory democracy. We examine the daily working of that democracy, asking how an Athenian was trained for citizenship. What did democracy mean in practice? What did freedom and autonomy mean to a society that relied on slaves and was ruthless in its treatment of its subjects? In order to answer these questions we juxtapose the breathtaking accomplishments of the Athenians, in fields such as philosophy, tragedy, comedy, sculpture and architecture, with the exclusion of women from public life, the torture and abuse of slaves, and the execution of other Greek populations. We will follow them from the height of their power to defeat at the hands of the Spartans. The picture that emerges is a portrait of a complex people and a complicated culture. Restless, adventurous, sophisticated, crude, pious, the Athenians are a people whose culture has a special significance for us. The ties between us are not casual, but deeply meaningful.",

Their contributions to philosophy, architecture, medicine, and other fields argue that they surely did advance rational thought. However, this view gives us an incomplete picture. Many Greeks, including well-educated, prominent Greeks, also found use for casting spells, fashioning voodoo dolls, toting magical amulets, ingesting magic potions, and protecting their cities from evil with apotropaic statues. In this course you will learn how to make people fall in love with you, bring harm to your enemies, lock up success in business, win fame and respect of your peers, and also some more general things about Greek and Roman society and religion -- you will also learn what \"apotropaic\" means.",

This course will examine our conceptions of art (including literary, visual and musical media) that are deemed by certain communities to transgress the boundaries of taste and convention. It juxtaposes modern notions of artistic transgression, and the criteria used to evaluate such material, with the production of and discourse about transgressive art in classical antiquity. Students will consider, among other things, why communities feel compelled to repudiate some forms of art, while others into classics.\"",

    "course_description" : "Just what is Late Antiquity? For this interdisciplinary course, it's the from the later third century within the Roman Mediterranean world up to the 8th-entury age of Charlemagne and the Islamic Arab expansion. Its territory spans the three continents ringing the Romans' Mediterranean Sea: Britain and Eurasia, North Africa and Egypt, the Near and Middle East. This period has been called an Age of Spirituality, to which the arts were critically important: those traditions include Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and many sorts of enduring paganism. To Romanists and Byzantinists, the period seems an Age of Invasions, whether by Goths and Franks in the west or the great expanding empires of the east, the Yet just as Partho-Sassanian realm based in Iran, and the early Islamic, Arab, Ummayad empire. the contending peoples sometimes intermarried and often traded with one another, their visual and material culture frequently documents cultural borrowing and exchange. The ancient Roman world had constructed national, imperial, personal identities with visual splendors and the artifacts of daily life. The Late Antique world still did. Moving around sites like its soldiers and merchants, princes and pilgrims, this course explores many sorts of objects and their economies of production and consumption -- sarcophagi and statuary, arches and coins, mosaic floors and painted halls, illustrated books and carved gems, artistry in silver and ivory and glass. We put them back in their settings: architecture and designed landscape in city and sanctuary, in tombs, houses, palaces, and country villas. We'll listen, too, to the ancient men and women who spoke about what to look at, why, and how, when they debated the status of the arts in society -- historians and religious leaders, poets and philosophers, novelists and letter-writers, and the messages written onto buildings and things. Tradition and innovation are the buzzwords of Late Antique art histories, classically symbolized by how Constantine refurbished the city of Rome, and also founded a brand new Christian Rome at the city he named for himself, Constantinople -- it became the capital of the Byzantine Romaioi until it fell to the Ottomans in the 15th century CE. Very deliberately, late Roman peoples (including invaders) repaired, recycled and emulated their inheritance of a millennium of Graeco-Roman design; the Late Antique peoples also celebrated vigorous contemporary identities by radical innovation in style, content, and production. The course will exploit the resources of the University Museum of Archaeology Anthropology; students will be encouraged to use the collections of regional museums. There will be one assigned museum field-trip outside of Philadelphia.",

This course will examine the ways in which the Greeks, and then the Romans, conceptualized the body, disease, and healing, and will compare these to medical culture of our time. We will consider sources from Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle to Galen and Soranus, and will juxtapose these writings with modern discourse about similar topics. We will also pay some attention to ancient pharmacology and religious healing, and will visit the Penn Museum to see their collection of ancient medical instruments. All readings will be in English and no previous background in Classical Studies is required. This course will be especially appealing (and useful) to Pre-med and Nursing students, and to students interested in the History of Science, Ancient Philosophy, and Classics.",

    "course_description" : "Ancient epics had a curious and rich afterlife in the Middle Ages. The epics of Virgil and Statius were taught in schools, read for their moral content, and revered as philosophical teaching. But their literary afterlife involved a remarkable shape-shifting into the genre romance: narratives in which erotic love, individual quests, imaginary or exotic settings, and the unpredictability of adventure replace the epic emphasis on duty, collective warfare, history (including mythic history), and the determinacy of fate. We will read Virgil's Aeneid and Statius' Thebaid, along with some ancient philosophical approaches classical epic, in order to set the stage for medieval receptions of the classical narratives. Among medieval romances of pagan antiquity, we will read two important French texts (in English translation) from the twelfth century: the Roman d'Eneas (Romance of Aeneas) and the Roman de Thebes (indirectly based on Statius' work). Then we will turn to some of the best known medieval English romances with classical themes or elements, including Chaucer's Knight's Tale and Troilus and Criseyde, and Chaucer's own quasi-epic, the House of Fame. Themes that we will consider closely will include the figure of Dido in medieval poetry and thought, and the importance of classical literary models for medieval poets.

The poor - particularly the rural poor who made up some 90% of the population - are largely undocumented and unexplored. The Roman Peasant Project, a collaborationbetween the University of Pennsylvania Museum and Cambridge University was designed to remedy this bias. Based in western Tuscany, we are excavating a series of small, poor sites, examining their remains for clues about the diet, agricultural strategies and environmental conditions of the Roman rural poor. In a unique partnership with local landowners, we excavate sites at speed, so so as to return them to agricultural use. Penn students will assist in this ground-breaking project by excavating (long hours, hard labor and good fun), learning the technology used in modern archaeology, and attending introductory lectures given by the Project's specialists in geophysics, field survey, Roman ceramics, the history of the Roman peasant, zooarchaeology (animal bones)geoarchaeology (rocks and soils for archaeologists) and paleobotany. Half the excavation team is Italian, and you'll learn basic conversational Italian from your peers. No previous experience or knowledge of Italian is required.",

We will cover the three hundred year period known as the Hellenistic Age from the career of Alexander the Great (354-323 BC) until the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium (31 BC). This was a period during which the world of the Greeks underwent extraordinary and far-reaching changes, as Greek culture was established as far afield as northwestern India, central Asia and Egypt. In the same period kingdoms controlled by Alexanders's Successors used Greek culture to define their rule, establishing a Greek culture of the elite in regions which previously had been dominated by the Persians. As Greek and non-Greek worlds collided, a new interpretation of Greek culture emerged, giving rise, among other things, to universities and professional schools, state subsidized health care, triumphalist architecture, the heroization of the noble savage, coinage with royal portraits, the deification of men and a multitude of other social, artistic and political forms familiar to us. It was an age of radical change, dislocation, as Greek populations colonized regions previously unkown to them.",

Traditionally the complex relationship between Greece and Rome has been seen from the Roman point of view, emphasizing the changes in Roman culture as a result of Rome's contact with the Greeks. This class takes a different approach, considering the impact on Greece. We will use the results of archaeological survey and excavation to chart the economic transformation of Greece, especially in relation to the Roman colony at Korinth. This will involve examining changes in land distribution, the growth of road networks, and the increase in large public works such as theatres, aqueducts and baths. We will also use writers such as Dio Chrysostom and Pausanias to consider the effect on the institutions of the traditional Greek city-state of being incorporated into a single province, Achaia. We will read some of the ancient novels, such as Longus' Daphnis and Chloe, as well as the essays of Plutarch. There are many avenues into the past, and the particular richness of our sources for Roman imperial history makes it possible for us to approach Greece from a variety of perspectives.",

Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as a few contemporary American ones, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions through a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals, religion and family, sex, love, madness, and death.",

Betrayed by her husband Jason, she takes her revenge on her children; yet, her anguish is visible, and leaves the audience in doubt. Are we to pity Medea, condemn her? Taking Euripides' tragedy as its starting point, this course examines the Medea myth across history, juxtaposing ancient portrayals with modern manifestations. Students are introduced to the Medea myth through a close reading of Euripides' Medea and secondary readings on Athenian tragedy. We then turn to the Argonautika of Apollonius of Rhodes, Ovidian poetry, Senecan drama, and material culture of the ancient world. In the second part ofthe course, we examine twentieth century reflections of Medea in a variety of contexts, including Pasolini's film, \"Medea,\" Martha Graham's dance, \"Cave of the Heart,\" and Christa Wolf's Medea: A Modern Retelling. Each adaptation asks students to engage with the Medea myth anew, and to trace patterns of continuity and change, status, identity, and gender. The echoes of Medea range across continents, genres, and media, and her name still has the power to reach the core of our emotional being. In the end, we must ask ourselves, who is who is Medea today?",

Our focus this year will be on the Stoics, with emphasis on their natural philosophy, theology, and ethics. Significant Stoic claims we will examine include: the theory of fate, the insistence that the world is governed by divine providence, and the view that following nature is the key to living a good life, while such things as health, family, and material well-being are of no value. Sources to be read include Cicero, ON THE NATURE OF THE GODS, and ON DIVINATION; Marcus Aurelius, MEDITATIONS; Epictetus, HANDBOOK; and Seneca, ON ANGER and selected letters. All texts will be read in English translation; no knowledge of Greek or Latin will be presupposed.",

Our objects range from public sculpture and painting on and around grand buildings and gardens, to domestic luxury arts like jewelry, cups and vases, mosaic floors, and the humbler objects of worship and every-day life. Greek addressed heroic epic, religous and political themes, engaged viewers' emotions, and served mundane as well as monumental aims. Current themes include Greek ways of looking at art and space, and ideas of invention and progress; the roll of monuments, makers and patrons in Greek society; and connections with the other cultures that inspired and made use of Greek artists and styles. To understand ancient viewers' encounters, you will meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb, house and city, garden and private collection; your readings will sample ancient peoples' art writing. Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods, and their relationships to archaeology, anthropology and other disciplines -- also to modern kinds of museums, not least our own University Museum of Archaeology. No prerequisites. This course fulfills the 'global requirement'. Of interest to students of classical, middle-eastern, visual and religious studies, anthropology, history, communications and the GSD programs.",

These philosophers generally agree that virtue is an important part of the best human life, but disagree about whether it is the greatest good (Epicurus, for example claims that pleasure is the highest good), or whether there are any other goods (for example, health, wealth, family). Much attention is paid in their theories to accounts of the virtues of character, and to the place of wisdom in the best sort of human life.",

This is survey of Etruscan culture from its origins in the Late Bronze Age to its gradual demise under Roman domination with reference to neighboring Italic cultures, the early Greek colonies of the West, and to the impact of Etruscan heritage on the art and literature of Roman, Medieval and Renaissance Italy and the modern world. The archaeology of this non-Indo-European ethnic group includes DNA analysis of modern populations, and new appreciation of the modes of urbanization (appearing earlier in Italy than in many areas). Scientific studies point up the debt of the modern world to Etruscan commerce, language and technology. In addition to issues of classical history, the Etruscan language and religion, art and architecture(including pottery, bronzes, terracottas and tomb painting,)students specialized interests (Classics, history, art history, anthropology)will be addressed in the second half of the term. Workshop sessions with artifacts and a tour of the newly opened Etruscan World Gallery in the University Museum are planned.",

    "course_description" : "Bad things happened at mythical Thebes: it was ill-starred from the start. Most famously, it was the kingdom that Oedipus came to rule, and where his unknowing patricide and incest spawned destructive civil war (over a paltry kingdom ) and bitter fratricide. This is the chaotic world that Statius depicted so brilliantly and painfully in his Thebaid. Early and later medieval readers were by turns fascinated and repelled by the Theban story they received from Statius, but fascination with the story overcame repulsion, and Statius himself emerged as one of the most revered of classical authors, second only to Virgil. In this seminar we will read the Thebaid and other mythographical sources on the Theban legend that were available to medieval audiences, and we will trace the receptions of the Theban story through the Middle Ages, from commentaries and citations to vernacular reinventions of the legend and the literary apotheosis of Statius in Dante and Chaucer. Along the way we will look at the Thebes story in the French Roman de Thebes and the Histoire ancienne jusqu'a Cesar. The Thebes story is embedded and enfolded in medieval understandings of the recursiveness of human history as tragedy (Chaucer's Troilus and Knight's Tale), even as that narrative can also be joined up with powerful teleological outlooks (Virgilian imperialism, Boethian transcendence, Christian salvation). We will look beyond the Middle Ages briefly to the earliest English translation of the Thebaid published in 1648 (a significant year for the Englishing of a classical narrative about civil war). All texts can be read in their original languages (Latin, French, Italian) or in English translations, so the readings will be accessible to all interested students no matter what their linguistic backgrounds. The day and time currently set for this class in the course register system is Friday afternoons; but this is negotiable, and if students desire we can agree on another day and time for the course as long as we stay clear of other schedule conflicts.",

By a close and careful reading of Homer's text, along with some reflections and readings drawn from more contemporary wars, including the current ones, we will try to examine these issues with one eye on the past and one on the present. Our goal will be to achieve some further understanding of war and human experience.",

It should be useful for students in any fields working in early and later periods (including post-Renaissance) who want a grounding in the intellectual and institutional history of rhetoric, the \"discourse about discourse\" that was central to curricular formations, aesthetics and theories of the passions, politics, ideas of history, and ideas of canons. We will read materials from sophistic rhetoric, from Plato and Aristotle, from Cicero, Quintilian, and rhetorical theorists from late antiquity (including Augustine); we will work through medieval materials from monastic and cathedral schools to the universities, considering how Ciceronian rhetoric carries an overwhelming influence into the Middle Ages; we will consider the professional stratification of various kinds of rhetorical production and theory in the late Middle Ages and look at some crucial literary embodiments of rhetoric; we will consider religious dimensions of rhetoric and especially its uses in women's religious communities and devotional writings; we will givesome attention to the late medieval recovery of Aristotle's Rhetoric and to the continuous tension between rhetoric, philosophy, and theology. And we will look at early modern recoveries of certain ancient texts and themes(e.g. Quintilian, the sophists, political education) in terms of new capacities for analysis of stylistics, affect, and deliberative (political) oratory (and we'll give special attention to early modern English rhetorics and poetics and to continental figures such as Erasmus). We will also read some modern reflections on the theory and historiography of rhetoric, and the class is open to any combination of theoretical and historical interests. All of our readings will be accessible in English.",

In recent scholarship, many of the tenets laid down by Moses Finley in his The Ancient Economy have been re-evaluated, with the result that the field is currently in a state of intellectual ferment. It is the purpose of this course to explore the terms in which contemporary debates over ancient economic systems are formulated, with reference to a variety of societies and periods, from the palace economies of the Mycenaean period to the system of taxation introduced in the early fourth century by the emperor Diocletian and his colleagues in the Tetrarchy.",

This course will survey Livia's different literary and material representations and attempt to come to terms with the various perspectives on the first empress presented by these texts and contexts. Livia provides a key figure through whom students will be exposed to various issues surrounding the portrayal of Roman women in the early empire. Through lecture and discussion, we will relate Livia to her contemporary world, and then examine the role of imperial women through the rest of the Julio-Claudian era and beyond. We will discover Livia's influence in creating the role of the empress, and analyze the differences between her representation as an ideal and that of later imperial women. Students will write brief response papers to primary texts and present on select secondary readings that add to our understanding of the portrayal of Livia and imperial women more generally.",

This foundation epic of Western literature tells of gods, heroes, and magical places already part of a deep past when Homer's work was set to writing, ca. 700 B.C. Does the Homeric story of the Trojan War have a basis in real events? Scholars have long pointed to the Mycenaean civilization, which flourished on the mainland of Greece in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600-1200 B.C.), as the inspiration for the Homeric stories. In this course, we will examine the archaeology of the great centers of the Late Bronze Age in Greece and Anatolia, particularly Mycenae, Pylos, and Troy. Our main aim will be to better understand the social, political, and economic context of this Late Bronze Age world, which may shed light on the possibility that a \"Trojan War\" of some kind actually occurred. The primary focus on archaeology is supplemented by readings from Homer's Illiad and Odyssey.",

Lectures focus on how archaeology can be manipulated to authenticate such fraudulent examples as the lost continent of Atlantis, the Piltdown man, ancient giants roaming the earth, and alien encounters. Background on the cultures to which such hoaxes have been attributed is given to refute their authenticity. Less clear-cut cases, such as the gold of Troy or the snake goddesses of Minoan Crete are carefully dissected to allow students to make their own conclusions on contested finds. Students explore why archaeology is particularly susceptible to biased interpretation designed to support nationalistic ideologies, religious causes, and even modern stereotypes. They discuss how archaeology has been used, both correctly and incorrectly, as propaganda in the modern world. Finally, the course explores careful archaeological method and how, as a social science, archaeology is capable of rejecting such interpretations about the past.",

    "course_description" : "The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy, philosophy, art, literature, drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest, warfare, administration, and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social, economic and political consequences of this great achievement, especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges, military, cultural, and religious, to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally, we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature, like satire, to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.",

    "course_description" : "This is a course on the history of literary theory, a survey of major debates about literature, poetics, and ideas about what literary texts should do, from ancient Greece to examples of modern European thought. The first half of the course will focus on early periods: Greek and Roman antiquity, especially Plato and Aristotle; the medieval period (including St. Augustine, Dante, and Boccaccio), and the early modern period ( such as Philip Sidney and Giambattista Vico). We'll move into modern and 20th century by looking at the literary (or \"art\") theories of some major philosophers, artists, and poetsKant, Hegel, Shelley, Marx, the painter William Morris, Freud, and the critic Walter Benjamin. We'll end with a look at Foucault's work. The point of this course is to consider closely the Western European tradition which generated questions that are still with us, such as: what is the \"aesthetic\"; what is \"imitation\" or mimesis; how are we to know an author's intention; and under what circumstances should literary texts ever be censored. During the semester there will be four short writing assignments in the form of analytical essays (3 pages each), and students can use these small assignments to build into a long writing assignment on a single text or group of texts at the end of the term. Most of our readings will come from a published anthology of literary criticism and theory; a few readings will be on Canvas.",

Is our identity shaped by the Greeks and Romans, or not? And how did we get from their culture to our own? We will survey different strands of the \"classical tradition\".

    "course_description" : "Gloss and commentary are the sinews and nerve system of medieval textuality. But so pervasive are these forms that we often take them for granted, consulting them for the data they can yield up about interpretive trends and future literary production. In this seminar we will look more closely at the formal, rhetorical, and material history history of gloss and commentary, from late antiquity to the later Middle Ages, in Latin and vernacular traditions, in sacred and secular domains. We will also look briefly at some non-Western fields of sacred commentary: Qur'anic exegesis, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Hebrew bible. The main topics we will cover can be summarized as follows: terminologies, formats, and character of gloss and commentary; the nature of large free-standing commentaries and examples of learned and literary texts that supported this particular form of critical approach; and interactions between text and commentary that gave rise to important theoretical understandings of letter and sense, literal and figurative (or allegorical) interpretation, authorial intention, and the interpretive control of the commentator. More particularly we will look at late antique and medieval definitions of gloss and commentary; ideological appropriations through the power of the limited gloss; the mise-en-page of commentaries (interlinear and marginal commentary vs. free-standing); commentators' prologues (the accessus and its forms); the emergence of catena (or chain) commentaries; and the self-marking of commentators. What do expositors call their commentaries and how do they name their own roles? Under what constraints (legal, theological, philological) do commentators labor, and how do they mark those constraints? What conventions emerge for denoting commentative intertextuality? What kinds of texts tend to support free-standing commentaries, and under what conditions does a marginal commentary become a free-standing commentary? What is the relationship between commentary and summa? And finally, how does a successful commentary transform the reception of a literary or sacred text, or an intellectual tradition, and what role does its formal rhetoric play in reshaping the understanding of a text? We can (and will) cover these topics through glosses and commentaries that havebeen translated into English (or through English-language studies on them); butstudents who know Latin and other languages (including medieval vernaculars) can take these questions further into their own fields (and the readings can be adjusted according to individual inclinations). Non-medievalists are welcome. Classicists will find much to think about in studying medieval commentaries on classical texts; and early modernists/modernists will find important insights for their own work on the ages of print by studying the technologies of manuscript annotation and transmission. We will have ample opportunity to look at the importation of gloss and commentary systems into vernacular literatures (primarily English and French).",

Regarded by the Greeks as an at least semi-barbarian culture on the periphery, Macedonia became the dominant power in the Greek world during the fourth century BC and its king Alexander the Great set out to conquer the world. After his death, Macedonia was one of the Hellenistic kingdoms competing for power and influence in the Mediterranean until it finally came under Roman control. Topics that will be discussed include questions of ethnicity and identity, Macedonian kingship, culture and society (including the role of women) and the role of Macedonian traditions in the Hellenistic era in general. Special emphasis will be laid on the discussion of ancient texts and documents as well as archaeological evidence.",

    "course_description" : "What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship', 'citizen body', or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest, if anything, about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts, which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus, the Pseudo-Xenophon, Diodorus Siculus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution, Aristotle himself, Polybius, Cicero, Tacitus, and Plutarch. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century, following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to the American colonial documents, the so-called state the debates in the Constitutional Convention; and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constiefforts in Europe, North Africa (especially Egypt), and elsewhere. In its 2014 version, the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws, either for domestic use or for colonies. The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials, where in is one on one, the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week, and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial, the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical, literary, and political context. In the next class, the students read short papers on the text, and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed, if necessary, and a prelecture on the text set for next class. At the end of the course, the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources. The course is conducted as a group tutorial.

People have been transforming their environment from the first use of fire for cooking. Since then, humans have adapted to the world they created using the resources around them. We use artifacts to understand how the archaeological record can be used to trace breakthroughs such as breaking stone and bone, baking bread, weaving cloth and firing pottery and metals. The seminar will meet in the Penn Museum's new Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials. Students will become familiar with the Museum's collections and the scientific methods used to study different materials. Class sessions will include discussions, guest presentations, museum field trips, and hands-on experience in the laboratory.",

    "course_description" : "This course will cover various important aspects of education and intellectual culture from late antiquity (c. 400 A.D.) to the later Middle Ages (c. 1400 A.D.) across Europe. We will look especially at how the arts of language (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic) were formalized and \"packaged\" in late antique/early medieval encyclopedias (e.g., Martianus Capella's \"Marriage of Mercury and Philology,\" Cassiodorus' \"Institutes of Divine and Secular Learning,\" Boethius and Augustine on rhetoric, Donatus and Priscian on grammar, Boethius on dialectic, Isidore of Seville on all the sciences), and at how later theorists and systematizers recombined and reconfigured knowledge systems for new uses (especially monastic education, including notably Hugh of St. Victor's \"Didascalicon\"). We will also look at how the earlier and later Middle Ages differentiated between \"primary\" and \"advanced\" education, how children and childhood are represented in educational discourse, how women participate in (or are figured in) intellectual discourse (Eloise, Hildegard of Bingen, Christine de Pizan), how universities changed ideas of intellectual formation, and how vernacular learning in the later Middle Ages added yet another dimension to the representation of learning. Among the later texts to be covered will be Abelards's\"Historica Calamitatum,\" John of Salisbury's \"Metalogicon,\" selections from Aquinas and other university masters, Jean de Meun's \"Roman de la Rose,\" Christine de Pizan's \"Chemin de Long Estude,\" Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\" (book 7), and possibly selections from Dante's \"Convivio.\" Students from all disciplines across the humanities are welcome. Classicts are encouraged to enroll, as well as, of course, medievalists and early modernists. Readings will all be available in English translation, but many of the readings can be done in the original languages (Latin, Old French or Middle French, Italian) as students wish (on an individual or collective basis). Class discussions, however, will always have reference to available translations. One seminar paper (15+ pages) will be required, along with (probably) one report.",

This course begins by examining ancient \"literary culture\": the various social practices and modes of communication through which ancient literature was produced, ranging from theories of divine inspiration to the conditions under which literature was performed, circulated, read, and transmitted. We then apply this framework to three major case-studies, reading \"masterpieces\" in three genres of the literary canon with a focus on their various social functions. Genres for study in spring 2015 are: (1) Lyric poetry; (2) Tragedy; (3) The Ancient Novel. Goals: This course is intended to give students a thorough familiarity with key works from the Greco-Roman literary tradition in conjunction with analysis of the sociology of literature in the ancient world. The primary objectives are critical reading, critical discussion, oral presentation, formal scholarly writing, and a greater sensitivity to sociocultural diversity in ancient Greece and Rome.",

But what were ancient battles really like? What weapons and tactics were used? What innovations and developments in ancient warfare changed the playing field? And who were the leading characters on the battlefield that lead their armies to victory? Through a survey of some of the great battles of the Ancient Near East (Egypt, Israel, Assyria) and the Classical World (Greece, Macedonia, Rome), this course will lead you to explore issues such as the historical context of ancient warfare, how different aspects of warfare evolve over time, and the role and effects of war in ancient society, on soldier and citizen alike. Each week we will tackle some of the most notable battles fought in the Mediterranean region from the Bronze Age to the first century CE, includinghe campaign of the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmosis III against Megiddo, Homer's Trojan War, the Athenian/Persian naval battle at Salamis, and the Roman army's siege of Masada. We will discuss ancient attitudes toward war and violence, theechnical aspects of armor, weaponry, and tactics, and the strategy of individual battles and wars. Additionally, we will debate the validity of the ancient literary sources and the archaeological evidence that provide information about war and warfare in antiquity, and we will review the problemsassociated with the use of this evidence. Additional topics of inquiry include the role of animals in war, depictions of war in ancient art, and the portrayal of warfare in Hollywood.",

In this class we will break the Roman Empire down down into a series of vignettes, using literature and archaeology to supply us us with the material for a fresh look at Roman society. Our aim isto uncover the complexity of Roman society, and to acknowledge the multiple voices that together made up the ancient Mediterranean world. We will focus upon key structural aspects of Roman society and culture, but explore them in new ways, using texts that highlight dissent, conflict and tension as they indicate cohesion and Rome's hegemony over the Mediterranean in antiquity. Texts will be read in translation. No prerequisites, although students are encouraged to take this course after taking ANCH 027/HIST 027.",

A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids, maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks, however, deserves a wider audience, because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, \"Know Thyself.\" For us, that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age, c. 1500 BC, down to the time of Philip of Macedon, c. 350 BC, concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.",

The course will look in general at the concept of an art or skill (\"techne\", \"ars\") and methods of instruction (manuals, didactic poetry, regimens, etc.), and will explore specific case studies (such as Socrates, Cicero, Ovid, Quintilian, and Apuleius).",

Whether in the realm of political or legal systems, philosophical and scientific discourse, mythological dreamscapes, psychology, literary genre or aesthetic theory, the contribution of Greek and Roman culture is routinely invoked sometimes to admire, other times to lament. It forms a highly complex narrative of reception and influence, shaped by historical contingencies, individual talents and temperaments, and continually shifting conceptions of what these contributions actually were. This seminar will trace the evolution of the Classical tradition, in all its varied and inconsistent manifestations, primarily through the visual arts. It will be a museum-based course, organized around four important Philadelphia museums or collections: (1) The Penn Museum (for ancient artifacts), (2) Penn s manuscript collection within van Pelt Special Collections (where we will examine original manuscripts of the Medieval and Renaissance periods that transmit Classical culture), (3) The Philadelphia Museum of Art, and (4) The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, both of which house many examples of painting and sculpture deeply informed by the Classical tradition.",

Among other tasks and projects, students will stage a 'reimagination' of the Constitutional (Philadelphia) Convention of 1787, which resulted in the United States Constitution. They will also emulate ancient moralists and satirists, who attacked Rome's 'Bread and Circuses' culture, by focusing their attention upon comparable practices in modern America.",
