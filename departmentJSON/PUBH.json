Health disparities are a fact of social and professional life. Addressing Health Disparities was the second overreaching goal of Healthy People 2010. Most policy initiatives toward eliminating health disparities have failed to close these gaps in population health policies. Preparation work for Healthy People 2020 will highlight this problem. The course will provide the students with the tools necessary to make ameliorating health disparities part of their career, whether in advocacy,program management, scientific inquiry or education.

In the seminar we will be bringing students from anthropology, and other social science and humanities disciplines in dialogue with students in public health, science studies, and clinical medicine.",
