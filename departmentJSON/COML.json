Characterized by a unique intelligence, marked by a magnificent range of beauty in appearance and song, subject to astonishing imperatives of instinct--birds speak to us across a vast gulf of evolutionary differentiation. If paleontologists are right, we encounter in birds the direct descendents of the dinosaurs. In this course we will discuss classics of avian culture and film, starting with Aristophanes' comedy THE BIRDS and the eleventh-century Persian book of poems known as CONFERENCE OF THE BIRDS (adapted for theater by Peter Brook and Jean-Claude Carriere) and moving on to works such as Hitchcock's famous film \"The Birds\" (based on a Daphne du Maurier story), \"Winged Migration,\" \"The Parrots of Telegraph Hill,\" Julian Barnes's novel FLAUBERT'S PARROT as well as a special section on birds in caroon and animation.",

In contrast, Sunjata Epic of Mali, Mwindo Epic of Congo and more than twenty-five other heroic narrative poems throughout Africa are less known but equally valuable for accessing ancient wisdom, exploits of heroes and heroines, cultural values, knowledge systems, and supernatural realms. An additional benefit of studying African epic is that they are performed today or in living memory, so the cultural, performative, and social contexts are not obscured by centuries. These living traditions give us opportunities to more fully understand bards' roles, interaction of bard and audience, transformation from oral to written representation, and the extension of epic themes into other aspects of social life.",

Central to the class are the varied and creative answers to the long question about how to write a progressive literature. Is the concept of a revolutionary literature useful today? We begin by turning to the legacy of Plato's banishment of poets from the good state as well as Aristotle's spirited defense of poets Writers and readings may also include: pamphlets by Martin Luther, essays by Thomas Paine and Friedrich Schiller; Buechner's drama Woyzeck, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, Trotsky's Literature and Revolution, Mariano Azuela's novel of the Mexican Revolution, The Underdogs, plays by Bert Brecht (Mother Courage and Her Children), and others.",

We will consider the role of various censorship authorities (both religious and secular) and grapple with the timely question about whether censorship is ever justified in building a better society. Case studies will focus on many well-known figures (such as Martin Luther, John Milton, Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe, Karl Marx, and Salman Rushdie) as well as lesser-known authors, particularly Anonymous (who may have chosen to conceal her identity to avoid pursuit by the Censor).",

Selecting for discussion only a few representative works in translation from pre-modern India (ranging from the earlist Sanskrit and Tamil texts, through to the mediaval literatures of South Asia's regional Languages (Kannada, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Telegu, Panjabi,Malayalam, Oriya etc) and up to the Hindavi romance traditions of the 16th century,the course will also broadly investigate the processes of masterpiece - making in South Asia, both through the lens of indegenous aesthetic formulations as well as from diverse contemporary perspectives of literary analysis. In doing so, the goal will be to come to some understanding of the immensely rich and complicated networks of language, literary form and the cultural life that have historically informed and continues to inform the production of literature of South Asia. Our semester covers seminal genres that also serve as the organizing principles for the course: the hymn, the lyric, the epic, the gnomic, the dramatic, the political, the prosaic, the tragic and the comedic. No background in South Asia studies or South Asian languages is required.",

We will begin with Heinrich Heine's satirical treatment of the romantic anachronisms of the early nineteenth century as a way to introduce our topic, but turn quickly to aspects of medieval revival between 1900 and 1950. During this time, an intense, consistent (and often overlooked) medieval impulse thoroughly permeates the development of German modernism. \"The Middle Ages\" becomes a popular source of images, themes, contents and religious feeling that manifest across the arts, and our course will survey the figures or types of works that convey \"the medieval\" in modernismthe modernist \"passion play\", the hagiographic biography, the mystical text that serves at the template for avant-garde poetics, modern contemplative poetry modeled on monastic prayer, expressionist painting of forgotten medieval saints, the filmic treatment of epic tales, the modern attempts to recuperate the past in medieval-style monuments. Some artists and authors include Rainer Maria Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Landauer, Ernst Kantorowitcz, Emil Nolde, Wilhelm Worringer, Hugo Ball.",

Through medieval allegorical practices we see some of the deepest continuities with ancient hermeneutical thought and also some of the most radical ruptures with the ancient past. Allegory, in other words, was as crucial and charged a term for medieval culture as for contemporary thought. Allegory is at once a trope, that is, a specific and delimited form, and an all-encompassing interpretive system. It will be the purpose of this seminar to try to articulate the connections between that particular form and that general system by examining medieval allegory in its various literary tnd philosophical contexts. Our focus will be the 12th through the early 15th centuries in both the vernacular and Latin, with attention to late antique pihlosopihcal and theological foundations. We will also incorporate readings from various modern perspective on the history and theory of allegory.",

In literature, this obsession manifests itself most clearly in the epistolary novel, which became the privileged form of expression chosen by all the major authors of the age. Because of the rise of epistolarity, the art of \"writing to the moment,\" in Richardson's memorable formulation, must be seen as one of the Enlightenment's principal voices. And, for the first time, the letter became a highly valued means of communication, in both the private and the public domains.",

Ventoux, Dante's Vita Nuova and Commedia, Boccaccio's Diana's Hunt, the Old French Vie de St. Alexis, and Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose). Discussion will focus on numerology as it relates to the medieval esthetic of order, the literary text as microcosmic counterpart to God's macrocosm, veiled meaning, and \"difficult\" poetics. We shall also consider the end of the tradition and what changes in science and culture brought about the disappearance of number symbolism in literature, except for a few moderns (e. g. Thomas Mann).",

As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies, in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face, and in large-scale, often industrial societies, in which the themes, symbols, and forms that permeate traditional life, occupy new positions, or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture, or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others, these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies, and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically, professionally, or culturally, within modern heterogeneous societies, and traditional societies in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and Australia,folkore plays a more prominent role in society, than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents. Consequently the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies and any society that is in a transitional phase.",

To understand more fully the salient contributions of German-Jewish thought, we will consider literary and religious texts from Heinrich Heine, Franz Kafka and Martin Buber, philosophical texts from Moses Mendelssohn, Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin, as well as scientific and political texts from Karl Marx, Theodor Herzl, and Sigmund Freud.",

It is more urgent than ever to consider what dissent might mean, what shapes it has taken historically, what connection might exist between it and literature, and what futures are possible. We will read key critical and theoretical work alongside some powerful, tender and controversial writings and films (largely but not exclusively produced in the postcolonial world), to inquire into the politics and poetics of governance and dissent. Students are invited to make connections with other historical and geographical contexts, and explore the different forms of dissent individual, collective, urban, rural, nationalist, pan-nationalist, religious, marxist, or feminist, to name but a few. We will pay special attention to different performances of dissent at a popular, mass or individual level.

We will pay special attention to the material comics are made of (words, images, color,...as well as typical formats) but also to its grammar: the panels (frames), gutters (the empty spaces between the panels) and spatial construction of the page, and aspects such as pace. The differences between the European, American and Asian (especially Japanese) traditions will form a central focus throughout the entire course, with special attention being paid to one of the key countries in the European BD (bande dessinee) tradition, to wit Belgium, which even has a national museum and a biennial festival dedicated to this \"9th Art\".",

    "course_description" : "The object of this course is to analyze narratives of adultery from Shakespeare to the present and to develop a vocabulary for thinking critically about the literary conventions and social values that inform them. Many of the themes (of desire, transgression, suspicion, discovery) at the heart of these stories also lie at the core of many modern narratives. Is there anything special, we will ask, about the case of adultery--once called \"a crime which contains within itself all others\"? What might these stories teach us about the way we read in general? By supplementing classic literary accounts by Shakespeare, Pushkin, Flaubert, Chekhov, and Proust with films and with critical analyses, we will analyze the possibilities and limitations of the different genres and forms under discussion, including novels, films, short stories, and theatre. What can these forms show us (or not show us)about desire, gender, family and social obligation? Through supplementary readings and class discussions, we will apply a range of critical approaches to place these narratives of adultery in a social and literary context, including formal analyses of narrative and style, feminist criticism, Marxist and sociological analyses of the family, and psychoanalytic understandings of desire and family life.",

The first half of the course will focus on early periods: Greek and Roman antiquity, especially Plato and Aristotle; the medieval period (including St. Augustine, Dante, and Boccaccio), and the early modern period ( such as Philip Sidney and Giambattista Vico). We'll move into modern and 20th century by looking at the literary (or \"art\") theories of some major philosophers, artists, and poetsKant, Hegel, Shelley, Marx, the painter William Morris, Freud, and the critic Walter Benjamin. We'll end with a look at Foucault's work. The point of this course is to consider closely the Western European tradition which generated questions that are still with us, such as: what is the \"aesthetic\"; what is \"imitation\" or mimesis; how are we to know an author's intention; and under what circumstances should literary texts ever be censored.",

In the course of our seminar, we will also reflect on the question whether architecture, a discipline that deals with an inhabitable environment, may differ in its relationship between theory and practice from other arts, such as painting or literature.",

By probing the political, cultural, and artistic interests that the young people in Iran have engaged since the Revolution, we might evaluate the effectiveness of that project. To what extent has the Iranian youth conformed to or resisted the kind of citizenship that its government determined for it? Do we sense ambivalence or apathy towards that subjectivity? This course will provide students with the materials necessary to construct an ethnographic portrait of contemporary Iranian youth. Examining a wide range of sources, including films, documentaries, blogs, graffiti, photography, memoirs, music videos, and novels, we will specifically attempt to locate and explore the various languages - visual, musical, written, and spoken - that have emerged alongside these youth cultures.",

A major theme will be the relations between \"Russian\" literature and history, in which literature is not only a mimesis of the historical process but often an active agent. Throughout, we will be particularly attentive to the periphery of literature. In the first place, this means an expanded geography, the inclusion of non-Russian Soviet and emigre writers before and after 1991, as well as an effort to theorize their structural position. Secondly, we will adopt the late Formalists' understanding of literary periphery as the genres, cultural forms, institutions, and phenomena that abutted the literary field and affected its processes. Depending on student interest, our attention to these objects of inquiry could be directed toward bardic song and the later lyric-centric Russian rock, samizdat and literary internet, thick journals and literary prizes, Soviet-era dissidence and today's protest culture.",

One of the aims of the course will be to develop a sense of \"cinematic literacy\"--to develop critical techniques that will make us active interpretators of the cinematic image by challenging the expectations that Hollywood has implanted in us: that films be action-packed wish-fulfillment fantasies. Italian cinema will invite us to re-examine and revise the very narrow conception that we Americans have of the medium. We will also use the films as a means to explore the postwar Italian culture so powerfully reflected, and in turn, shaped, by its national cinema. Classes will include close visual analysis of films using video clips and slides. The films will be in Italian with English subtitles and will include works of Fellini, Antonioni, De Sica, Visconti, Pasolini, Wertuller, Rossellini, Rossellini, Bertolucci and Moretti.",

We will consider these worldviews against a broad cultural background and will reenact them in class in the form of philosophical mini-dramas. The only prerequisite for this course is intellectual curiosity and willingness to embrace diverse, brave and often weird ideas.",

First, we will look at its literary history (medieval illuminated manuscripts, Hogarth, Goya, Toepfer, leading us into the 20th and 21th century). Next, we will investigate how graphic novels or comics work, studying them as hybrid word-and-image forms in which two narrative tracks--one veral and one visual--create a \"double vision' genre. We will pay special attention to the material comics are made of (words, images, color,...as well as typical formats) but also to its grammar: the panels (frames), gutters (the empty spaces between the panels) and spatial construction of the page, and aspects such as pace. The differences between the European, American and Asian (especially Japanese) traditions will form a central focus throughout the entire course, with special attention being paid to one of the key countries in the European BD (bande dessinee) tradition, to wit Belgium, which even has a national museum and a biennial festival dedicated to this \"9th Art\".",

Alongside this Hollywood tradition of Jewish film, Yiddish film blossomed from independent producers between 1911 and 1939, and interpreted literary masterpieces, from Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" to Sholom Aleichem's \"Teyve the Dairyman,\" primarily for an immigrant, urban Jewish audience. In this course, we will study a number of films and their literary sources (in fiction and drama), focusing on English language and Yiddish films within the framework of three dilemmas of interpretation: a) the different ways we \"read\" literature and film, b) the various ways that the media of fiction, drama, and film \"translate\" Jewish cultue, and c) how these translations of Jewish culture affect and are affected by their implied audience.",

In this course, we will study key texts, statements and debates that define these issues, and will work towards a broad knowledge of the complex rewriting of the project of literary studies in process today.

    "course_description" : "At a time when contemporary culture is markedly engaged in a repudiation of secularism and a return to religious belief, it may be interesting to explore the Enlightenment as a mirror image and origin of our present situation. The Enlightenment has long been understood as a trans-European effort to counter, if not flatly reject religion, superstition, the church, and divinely instituted monarchy. Recent scholarship challenges this conception and urges us to think of the Enlightenment engagement with religion and the Bible as a productive encounter. Enlightenment thinkers and writers in Germany (including members of the Haskalah) presided over an explosion of biblical scholarship, exegesis, interpretation, theologizing, and literary adaptation. As Jonathan Sheehan argues, the Enlightenment did not reject the Bible--the Enlightenment changed it. Topics will include: pietism, gender, and subjectivity; theodicy; the Berlin Haskalah; anti-semitism; Spinozism and radical Enlightenment; sacred history and the origins of historicism; translation, interpretation and adaptation. Authors will include: Lessing, Mendelssohn, Klopstock, Herder, Goethe, Jung-Stilling, Kant, Moritz, and Maimon, as well as new scholarship by Sheehan, David Sorkin, Jeffrey Freedman, Jonathan Hess, and others.",

We will read materials from sophistic rhetoric, from Plato and Aristotle, from Cicero, Quintilian, and rhetorical theoriests from late antiquity (including Augustine); we will work through medieval materials from monastic and cathedral schools to the universities, considering how Ciceronian rhetoric carries an overwhelming influence into Middle Ages; we will consider the professional stratification of various kinds of rhetorical production and theory in the late Middle Ages and look at some crucial literary embodiments of rhetoric as disciplinary force.",

Course requirements comprise participation in weekly class sessions, updates on the progress of one's research and difficulties and discoveries therein, and a paper of journal- length size relating to a subject in which primary source materials have been extensively consulted. The paper should include a bibligraphy of published accounts and a critical evaluation of surviving papers. A list of subjects compiled by the professor will draw on resources available in several Penn repositories, including the Department of Special Collections, the University Archives and Records Center, the Center for the Study of the History of Nursing and other special libraries in the Philadelphia area.",

At the same time, research has also focused on the rupture of narrative, the inability to find appropriate forms of telling, and the experience of a loss of words. The notion of trauma (Greek for \"wound\") may stand for such a rupture. Many kinds of narratives, most prominently the recollections of Holocaust survivors, are instances in which memories are invoked not only to come to terms with traumatic events, but also to inscribe trauma in various ways. In this seminar, we will read theoretical work on memory and trauma, discuss their implication for the study of literature, art, and culture, read select examples from Holocaust survivors' autobiographies (i.e. Primo Levi, EliWiesel), and discuss visual art (i.e. Boltanski, Kiefer) and film (i.e. Resnais, Lanzmann, Spielberg).",

Second, we will look at how we identify a \"classic\" in our culture, and will try to understand what sort of work it does for us. Texts to be read will include: Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY; Euripides' BACCHAE; Sophocles' OEDIPUS THE KING; Aeschylus' PROMETHEUS BOUND; Aristophanes' FROGS; Virgil's AENEID; THE CONFESSIONS OF ST AUGUSTINE, and Dante's DIVINE COMEDY.

We will look at the ever-changing role of woman in Israeli films. We will also question the essence of Jewish identity in Israeli cinema and the effect 3,000 years of a complex history have on the modern day hero.",

This general requirement course explores the world of Nazi cinema ranging from infamous propaganda pieces such as The Triumph of the Will and The Eternal Jew to entertainments by important directors such as Pabst and Douglas Sirk. More than sixty years later, Nazi Cinema challenges us to grapple with issues of more subtle ideological insinuation than we might think. The course also includes film responses to developments in Germany by exiled German directors (Pabst, Wilder) and concludes with Mel Brooks' The Producers. All lectures and readings in English.

As the world transitions its drug laws regarding psychedelic medicines, the legalization of marijuana, and \"mandatory minimum\" jail sentences, how can we gain insight into the cultural history of drugs in our society? This Critical Speaking Seminar will provide the opportunity for students to directly engage with recent debates over drug legislation by critically reflecting on the evolution of literature about drugs over the past 250 years. In conversation with newspaper articles, scientific research, governmental reports, and literary texts, we will examine the history of drug use and legislation from America's early stages of prohibition through President Nixon's \"war on drugs\" to contemporary legal challenges. How does the cultural understanding of drugs change with shifts in rhetoric? How can we balance the need to protect society as a whole while still respecting individual freedoms and privacy? What role should the government play in regulating scientific research? How can the latest scientific and sociological research help to guide legislative decisions? We will respectfully opposing viewpoints through discussions, individual and group presentations, and in-class debates.",

Yet scholarship of the last several decades has shown the inadequacy of this claim. This graduate level course will reconstruct some of the underlying problems with this claim and suggest that examination of developments in the broader Roman, Christian and Islamic societies offer alternate ways of accounting for the emergence of these Jewish subcultures in the Middle Ages. Topics to be explored include cultural-geographic patterns following the collapse of the Roman Empire; divergent approaches to Islamic law under the abbasid and Umayyad caliphates; genres of legal composition in different parts of the Islamic world, and the status of aggadah (i.e., non-legal rabbinic tradition) in medieval Ashkenaz and Sephardic traditions.

Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be, employs a range of new materials and technologies, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the \"canon\" of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe, but is becoming increasingly global. The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists of the post-war period, with emphasis on social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant.",

    "course_description" : "Berlin was arguably the twentieth century's most important city. It produced some of the world's most innovative art, architecture, literature, theater and film during the 1920s, yet went on to become Hitler's capital in the 1930s. It was the iconic city of the Cold War as its Western sectors received U.S. aid during the Berlin airlift and as its neighborhoods were torn asunder by the Wall in 1961. Is is a city defined as much by its image and its symbolic force as by the reality of life along its boulevards and in its apartment buildings. This course will examine Berlin's image in the twentieth century from the heyday of the cabarets to the new palaces of glass and steel in which today's parliament and chancellor conduct the affairs of state. Key source material will include poetry, political manifestos, travel guides, short stories and films by Berliners, Germans from other towns and visitors from the English speaking world. Alfred Doeblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz, Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories, John LeCarre's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Billy Wilder's A Foreign Affair, Bob Fosse's Cabaret, Wim Wender's Wings of Desire and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's The Lives of Others are important texts and films to be treated during the semester.",

When are such responses appropriate? In particular, does an appropriate aesthetic attitude require emotional distance from the object of the artwork? Is it inappropriate to respond emotionally to morally depraved artworks? How do formal devices induce, constrain, and otherwise alter our emotional responses to art? Readings will be drawn from philosophers including Jean-Baptise Du Bos, David Hume, Edmund Burke, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Home Lord Kames, Arthur Schopenhauer, Edward Bullough, R.G.

    "course_description" : "\"We asked for workers. We got people instead.\" This quote by Max Frisch has been frequently cited on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Turkish guest worker migration in 2011. Despite the permanency of the assumed temporary guest worker migration in the 1960s, it was not until the turn of the millenium that Germany was officially considered to be an immigration country. Nevertheless, integration and assimilation are key words not only in the debates on migration to Germany but also in terms of German identity as whole. This course aims to give an overview on migration in/to Germany after the 1960s by looking at significant events around issues of migration as well as by exploring how migration to Germany changed German culture. We will cover events such as the arrival of the guest workers, the fires of Solingen and Molln and the disputes around the highly controversial book by Thilo Sarrazin, as well as texts in a broad sense such as literature, film or music by or on migrants and migration. The central question of the course will be how the cultural landscape in Germany has been influenced by migration in the past 50 years.",

Throughout the semester, students will be invited to consider Nietzsche's philosophical inheritances (from, for instance, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer) and influences (on Heidegger, Foucoult, Deleuze, Derrida and many others).

In Fate and Chance in Literature and Culture, we will explore these two interrelated concepts in comparative perspective over a broad historical range. As a result, the students will learn how the philosophy of fate and chance has been reflected in works of different Russian authors and in different cultural and political environments. In Russian as well as western systems of belief fate and chance represent two extreme visions of the universal order, or, perhaps, two diametrically opposed cosmic forces: complete determinism, on the one hand, and complete chaos or unpredictability, on the other. These visions have been greatly reflected by various mythopoetic systems. In this course, we will investigate religious and folkloric sources from a series of Russian traditions compared to other Indo-European traditions (Greek, East-European). Readings will include The Song of Prince Igor's Campaign, The Gambler by Dostoevsky, The Queen of Spades by Pushkin, Vij by Gogol, The Black Monk by Chekhov, The Fatal Eggs by Bulgakov, and more.",

How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation, replication, plagiaris, piracy, sampling, plundering, as compositional methods. Along the way, we'll trace the rich history of forgery, frauds, hoaxes, avatars, and impersonations spanning the arts, with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change, procedure, repetition, adn the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional notions of time, place, and identity, all as expressed linguistically.",

Contextualizing Marx within a tradition of radical thought regarding politics, religion, and sexuality, we will focus on the philosophical, political, and cultural origins and implications of his ideas. Our work will center on the question of how his writings seek to counter or exploit various tendencies of the time; how they align with the work of Nietzsche, Freud, and other radical thinkers to follow; and how they might continue to haunt us today. We will begin by discussing key works by Marx himself, examining ways in which he is both influenced by and appeals to many of the same fantasies, desires, and anxieties encoded in the literature, arts and intellectual currents of the time. In examining his legacy, we will focus on elaborations or challenges to his ideas, particularly within cultural criticism, postwar protest movements, and the cultural politics of the Cold War. In conclusion, we will turn to the question of Marxism or Post-Marxism today, asking what promise Marx's ideas might still hold in a world vastly different from his own.",

Drawing on a wide range of texts from fiction and poetry to autobiography, musicology, literary criticism and reportage, we will pay particular attention to how music figures as a sign of authenticity in black literature as slavery, the Great Migration of the early 20th century, class mobility and gender identities put pressure on the politics of belonging. Throughout the course the relationship between African American culture and the wider Black Atlantic will remain a crucial concern. We'll begin with the role of music as memory in accounts of remembered Africa songs in autobiographical work by W.E.B. Du Bois, Toni Morrisons Song of Solomon, and a film tracing a mourning song in the Gullah islands of South Carolina to its corollary among the Mende people of Sierra Leone. We'll then spend some time listening to vernacular music (spirituals, work-songs, and blues) and explore the politics of how and why these forms found varying degrees of acceptance, particularly in the milieu of the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro movement. Students need not have an extensive background in musicology, but should be prepared to devot time to weekly listening.",

While Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem \"I want to die in my bed\" was a manifesto for individualism, the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict returned writers to the national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980's. Readings include poems by Natan Alterman, Ami Gilboa, Meir Wieseltier and Roni Somek as well as ficition by Amos Oz, David Grossman, Sayed Kashua, Alona Kimhi and Etgar Keret.

In an effort to better understand how the horror film makes us confront out worst fears and our most secret desires alike, we will look at the genre's main iconic figures (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc.) as well as issues of ethics, gender, sexuality, violence, spectatorship through a variety of critical lenses (psychoanalysis, socio-historial and cultural context, aesthetics,...).",

A detailed examination of this monarch's vision of a \"Global Europe\" will allow us to explore a network of connections, a network that stretches from Prague to the farthermost western, eastern and southern corners of the textual, political, and religious communities, while attempting to show how Latin and Slavic European cultures were interwoven. Some of the titles from the reading list are Charles IV's The Life of St. Wenceslas and Autobiography, The Golden Bull, Dante's Letters & Monarchia, Machaut's Judgement of the King of Bohemia, The Life of St. Constantin the Philosopher, fragments from Czech, French, Italian, Polish, Hungarian and Rus medieval chronicles, etc. All reading will be done in English, with original language versions always available.",

As an aspect of identity that can be remarkably flexible, disability interacts in challenging ways with other markers of identity, including race, gender, class, and sexuality, and this course will provide students with analytical tools that help account for this overlap. We will consider the various strategies for framing disability, as well as their consequences, in a range of twentieth-century plays, novels, memoirs, short stories, and films, including works by Helen Keller, Ken Kesey/Milos Forman, Kenzaburo Oe, Heiner Mueller, Terry Galloway, Friedrich Duerrenmatt, and Katharine Dunn, as well as read influential studies by David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder, Lennard Davis, Rosemarie Garland Thomson, and others.",

This course proposes a structured approach to some of the main tools used by digital humanists in real-life textbased projects; students will be introduced to XML and the TEI, to XSLT, to R (through the Stylo package) and to simple Python scripts (through NLTK, the Natural Language Tool Kit).

Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as a few contemporary American ones, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions through a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals, religion and family, sex, love, madness, and death.",

We begin by investigating the contested term itself, paying close attention to critics and activists who deplore the very idea that we should try to sustain our, in their eyes, dystopian present, one marked by environmental catastrophe as well as by an assault on the educational ideals long embodied in the humanities. We then turn to classic humanist texts on utopia, beginning with More's fictive island of 1517. The \"origins of environmentalism\" lie in such depictions of island edens (Richard Grove), and our course proceeds to analyze classic utopian tests from American, English, and German literatures. Readings extend to utopian visions from Europe and America of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as literary and visual texts that deal with contemporary nuclear and flood catastrophes. Authors include: Bill McKibben, Jill Kerr Conway, Christopher Newfield, Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Karl Marx, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Owens, William Morris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ayn Rand, Christa Wolf, and others.",

Hence the readings will range from Shakespeare's plays or Donne's poems to a speech by Queen Elizabeth's or Columbus's letter announcing the \"discovery\" of the Americas. We will try to understand the fashioning of various identities--such as those of gentleman, lady, monarch or subject--at this time. We will trace the changing meanings of gender, the family, love, authority, the nation and race.

We will read widely and diversely, considering examples of performance and performativity in poetry, drama, short stories, novels, essays and film. What does it mean for us, and for texts to perform? What are the limits of performance? Where and when does performance begin and end? How does performance inform our understanding of literature, gender, race, national identity, cultural practices and day-to-day life? To answer these questions, we will read literary and theoretical works by: Austin, Barthes, Butler, Cervantes, Culler, Derrida, Goffman, Lafferiere, Roach, Schechner and Usigli, among others. All readings will be in English, many in translation. No experience with drama, performance or theater required, but a willingness to read playfully, think reflexively, and (re)present creatively is strongly encouraged.",

Over the course of the twentieth century film assumed a similar role. And even though the relationships between the two kept changing as did that between nation and empire, this dialectical perspective of culture as both a reflection and agent of social change will inform our discussion of a number of canonical Russian films, novels, and short stories. Helping us contextualize them will be some classical theoretical contributions on nationalism and imperialism.",

Selected works are read in translation; poetry is discussed first, then belles-lettrist prose. Selected suras from the Qur'an are read as the centerpiece of the course. Each set of texts are accompanied by a collection of background readings which place the authors and works into a literary, political and societal context. This course thus attempts to place the phenomenon of \"literature\" into the larger context of Islamic studies by illustrating the links between Arab litterateurs and other contributors to the development of an Islamic/Arab culture on the one hand and by establishing connections between the Arabic literary tradition and that of other (and particularly Western) traditions.",

We will consider the role of various censorship authorities (both religious and secular) and grapple with the timely question about whether censorship is ever justified in building a better society. Case studies will focus on many well-known figures (such as Martin Luther, John Milton, Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe, Karl Marx, and Salman Rushdie) as well as lesser-known authors, particularly Anonymous (who may have chosen to conceal her identity to avoid pursuit by the Censor).",

This course is in seminar format to encourage lively discussion and is team-taught by four professors whose expertise in modern Middle Eastern literature serves to create a deeper understanding and aesthetic appreciation of each literary trandition. In addition to honing students' literary analysis skills, the course will enable students to become more adept at discussing the social and political forces that are reflected in Middle Eastern literature, explore important themes and actively engage in reading new Middle Eastern works on their own in translation.

Everyone travels to the National Arts Festival in late June and spends two weeks attending live performances (4-6 per day), blogging on the performances, discussing these experiences with the Professor and fellow students; we visit a game park and do a \"township tour\" as part of the two weeks in the Eastern Cape. On returning home, students have about 4 weeks to write a substantial paper on the festival experience. While this is primarily a music class, the National Arts Festival includes all kinds of performances--theater, music, dance, and visual arts, of all kinds.
