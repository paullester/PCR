Metrics for evaluation, company and regulatory expectations and the tools used to facilitate decision (e.g., modeling and simulation techniques to generate \"what-if\" scenarios) making are all discussed in detail.  A key feature of the course is 7 \"labs\" which involve instructor-led decision analysis role playing.  The class will be divided into small teams that review data generated at different stages to examine the thought processes and decision criteria evaluable at different stages of drug development.  Labs are constructed from actual case study examples and team performance will be evaluated at the conclusion of the lab session.",
