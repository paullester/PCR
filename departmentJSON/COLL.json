    "course_description" : "Literatures of the World\" is an \"umbrella course\" covering a family of related courses numbered COLL 221 to 229 each dealing with a particular non-English literature in its original language. These courses, several of which are taught each semester, encourage the understanding of literature within the social contexts in which it was created and examine the works' continuing significance in the modern literary arena. They also introduce students to works of creativity and cultivate their powers of textual perception by providing them with tools for literary analysis, interpretation and criticism. Although the content of the various courses is drawn from specific literary traditions, the emphasis in each course is on developing and strengthening students' general capacity for understanding meaning. The interpretive strategies for literary analysis that the students acquire are universal and applicable to any modern literary tradition. A crucial component of any of these classes is writing analytical essays, thereby training the students to formulate their thoughts in a coherent, well-articulated manner. The current roster includes courses from the following departments: Germanic Languages & Literatures (German); Near Eastern Languages & Literatures (Arabic, Hebrew); Romance Languages (French, Spanish); Slavic Languages (Russian); and, South Asia Studies (Hindi).",

Grading is based primarily on students' literary understanding. There will be four 2-page written assignments over the course of the semester. We will discuss literary works that reflect Israelis' struggle with their national identity, from the patriotic 1948 generation for whom self and country overlapped to contemporary writers who ask what it means to be Israeli. While Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem \"I want to die in my bed\" was a manifesto for individualism, the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict returned writers to the national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980's. Readings include poems by Natan Alterman, Amir Gilboa, Meir Wieseltier and Roni Somek as well as ficition by Amos Oz, David Grossman, Sayed Kashua, Alona Kimhi and Etgar Keret.
