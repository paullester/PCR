At the beginning level spoken Urdu and Hindi are identical except for a few minor points. The broad outline of the course will thus remain the same as that of the current Beginning Hindi and Urdu courses. Students will learn to communicate with the language in a variety of everyday culturally authentic situations. Additional Urdu and Hindi culture will be integrated through authentic materials such as Bollywood film and music clips, and simple written texts. There will be equal emphasis on both scripts and cultures, and parallel written materials will be provided in both scripts. Students will be expected to develop first-year proficiency in one script of their choice, and will be encouraged to learn both. By merging the two courses students will be exposed to a broader range of linguistic and cultural styles, and students will thus have the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding that more closely resembles that of Hindi and Urdu native speakers.

Also, students will engage with the content and language through guest lectures, print and audio-video texts gathered from national and international media, such as VOA, BBC, and Business Standard. By the end of the semester, students are expected to enhance their knowledge about Indian business, gain linguistic competence (lexical, socio-cultural and pragmatic) to increase their confidence and comfort level in business domains, and access culturally embedded viewpoints about local and global business issues. In order to demonstrate the above, students will engage in projects that will require them to do research, conduct interviews and make presentations of their findings.",
