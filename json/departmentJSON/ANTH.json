This Freshman Seminar will explore both the ancient archaeology and contemporary history of Turkey. Often simplified as a bridge between East and West, we will instead examine the role played by the past in the formation of a modern nation-state. In other words, what is the relationship between the ancient and the present of this Middle Eastern country? Themes such as Turkish nationalism, secularism and Islam, Turkey's ethnic minorities, modernization and traditions, will guide our lectures, discussions and readings throughout the semester. As we evaluate the impact of history and archaeology on contemporary Turkish culture and identity, students will read across the social sciences, incorporating literature, cinema, music, and food, in order to complement their classroom experience with a lived awareness of the country.",

It has led to many new and exciting insights in the field of biological anthropology, particularly those subareas concerned with human origins and biological diversity, and is having an equally important influence on the biomedical sciences. Furthermore, through the use of new genetic technologies, the entire human genome has been sequenced, giving us an opportunity to better understand the nature of human development, disease and biological variation at the molecular level. This course will explore the new findings in biological anthropology resulting from the use of these genetic methods, as well as examine the social and political implications of these advances. Among the topics to be covered in the course are the Human Genome Project, genetic testing in forensic and criminal cases, race and biological variation, genetic engineering, the genetic basis of disease, and modern human origins.",

As even the most mundane purchase becomes socially symbolic and culturally meaningful we can persuasively argue that the concept of \"need\" has been transformed. Analyzing a variety of physical and virtual consumer venues, the goal of this seminar is to understand and to analyze historical and contemporary issues related to a culture of consumption. We investigate social and political-economic factors that impact when and how people purchase goods and argue that behavior attached to consumption includes a nexus of influences that may change periodically in response to external factors. Readings and research assignments are interdisciplinary and require a critical analyses of global/local linkages. The city of Philadelphia becomes the seminar's laboratory as we ask how have issues of culture, consumption, and global capitalism become intertwined around the world?",

Defining work as a human activity that combines economic, symbolic, and ideological dimensions into its operations, this course will discuss how the historical capitalism has tranformed the material and symbolic dimensions of everyday work places and, accordingly, triggered diverse responses from working people located in different time periods and spaces. We will analyze ethnographic and historical accounts of the past and present work places, including artisan workshops, small-scale farm fields, electronic assembly lines, garment factories, mine fields, and bank wiring rooms. These work places will be analyzed in connection with some key theoretical topics, such as class, gender, ethnicity, localism, and transnational/late capitalism.",

Through our examination of The Wire and other text, this class will study the distribution of key social resources--wealth, power, and status-- to groups and individuals, as well as theoretical explanations of how unequal patterns of distribution are produced, maintained, and challenged. Special consideration will be given to how race, ethnicity, and gender intersect with social class to produce different life experiences for people in various groups in the United States. Through practical, experience-based projects and exposure to the relevant literature, the student will amass a working knowledge of the issues of inequality in urban America, while the vividness and thick description of The Wire's characters will be used to illustrate the viability of anthropological methods to study and address contemporary problems. This course will also focus on the development, design, analysis, and presentation of research with ethnographic depth using observational methods.",

Faunal analysis is an interdisciplinary science which draws methods from archaeology, biology, and paleontology. Bones, shells, and other remains yield evidence for the use of animals by humans, and evidence for the biology of animals and for past environments. The course will focus on research approaches to important transitions in human-animal relationships: the development of human hunting and fishing, animal domestication, early pastoralism, and the emergence of market economies in animal products. Class presentations will include lectures and discussion concerning research design and archaeological case material, with additional videos, slidework with field and laboratory equipment, and supervised work identifying and describing archaeological materials from the University Museum's collections.",

This class will focus on case studies and critiques of how archaeology and the past are created, presented and used in movies, museums, games, the internet, and art. In addition to exploring general concepts of archaeology and the media, students will work in teams to produce an interactive, digital media exhibit using the latest modeling and augmented reality programs for the new archaeological museum at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Tiwanaku, Bolivia. Although nearly abandoned for a millennium and sacked by treasure hunters, the ruins are considered one of the most important archaeological sites in South America and visited by 45,000 tourists a year. Potential class projects include fly-throughs of architectural renderings; simulations of the design and engineering of the pyramids, temples, and palaces; modeling of human behavior within architectural settings; and studying artifacts in the Penn Museum. The results will be displayed in the Tiwanaku Museum and will serve to introduce visitors to the site.",

They will learn about the spread of writing to other societies and the invention of phonetic writing. We will discuss the many social meanings associated with writing in ancient societies. How did State-level societies use writing for propagandistic purposes? How was writing used for political subversion? How did the knowledge of writing systems contribute to social status and prestige in the ancient world? We will also examine the processes of script fossilization and obsolescence as well as the intentional destruction of the written word.",

Course discussions will begin by examining how the historical process of industrialization created the modern concepts of time and the ideal industrial workers. Later we will investigate how local communities and individuals react to the changes caused by rapidly globalizing capitalism. By reading ethnographic writings about the various workplaces in capitalist and post-socialist countries, students can understand how the existing \"culture\" of the people has affected their reactions to the incessant changes. Course topics include both domestic and international cases. For domestic workplaces, we will look into the daily lives of MBA job holders in Manhattan, part-time restaurant workers in the Midwest, and Mexican migrant workers in the Deep South. For international workplaces, we will investigate Japanese white-collar workers' reaction to the call of globalization, Colombian tin miners' survival strategies to the fluctuating international market price of tin ore, Chinese workers' understanding of their sweatshop jobs, Indian women workers' views about their jobs in a global call center; origins of \"corporate culture\" and its local applications in South Korea.",

It applies the concepts and methods of anthropology, history, political economy and sociology to the analysis and interpretation of what is actually happening in the course of the semester that relates to the progress of globalization. We focus on a series of questions not only about what is happening but about the growing awareness of it and the consequences of the increasing awareness. In answering these questions we distinguish between active campaigns to cover the world (e.g. Christian and Muslim proselytism, free-trade agreements, democratization) and the unplanned diffusion of new ways of organizing trade, capital flows, tourism and remote interaction via the Internet. The body of the course deals with particular dimensions of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of each. The overall approach is historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of the economic, political and cultural development of various parts of the modern world. The course is taught collaboratively by an anthropologist, an historian, and a sociologist, offering the opportunity to compare and contrast distinct disciplinary approaches. It seeks to develop a general social-science-based theoretical understanding of the various historical dimensions of globalization: economic, political, social and cultural.",

Social problems, such as environmental change, the welfare of refugees, human rights abuses, or poverty in the Global South, have increasingly come to be seen as global issues best solved through multinational or international cooperation. Efforts to address these problems bring together diverse stakeholders, international experts, policy makers, politicians, civil servants, activists, international and local volunteers as well as local people, each interpreting \"the problem\" from different cultural perspectives and possessing varying degrees of power to affect change. Ethnographic analysis is particularly well suited to examining the diverse and conflicting social interactions, misunderstandings and multiple perspectives, cultural politics and power dynamics that arise locally within these zones of awkward engagement and that ultimately shape the outcomes of social change efforts. The course will emphasize the close and critical reading of ethnographic accounts of a range of social improvement efforts --environmentalist, human rights, refugee relief, and fair trade economic efforts-- across different regions of the world to gain a better understanding of how cultural diversity and power relations shape social interaction within these globalizes zones of awkward engagement. Students will gain a deeper understanding of the nature and practice of ethnographic research and of the challenges faced in engaging globally.",

Museums have long been engaged in the selective preservation, representation, and contextualization of Indigenous objects, cultures, and histories. We will examine antiquarian impulses that inspired the collecting of curiosities, scientific studies that drove the collection of biological specimens, and nationalist ideals that shaped monuments to house imperialist memories. Museums are now sites for complex, often contentious discourse around Indigenous collections. Students will review histories of local and national collecting processes, with a particular focus on Native American collections and concerns. We will also consider how Indigenous curators and new kinds of museums have developed innovative displays and interpretations.",

This course reviews anthropological and social science literatures that are studies of, or have relevance to the study of, corporations or businesses more broadly. Students will learn how businesses, as social organizations and as an empiricalfocus of study, can be differently conceptualized and approached by examining how different theoretical paradigms and assumptions have shaped the research questions. Students will also learn what methods can be used to do ethnographic researches in organizational settings. The ultimate goal would be to understand how theories and methods work in relation to each other, in the context of anthropological study of business organizations. Among the questions this course asks are: how do different views of \"culture\" influence the study of organizations? How does theory influence recognition as to what counts as data; and how have specific observations at field sites informed the development of theories of businesses and different aspects of business organizational life? The readings are selectively chosen from foundational textthat lay the grounds for anthropology of business (e.g., Taylor, Weber); Human Relations Area field; Anthropology of Work; as well as the more recent texts that provide regional cross-cultural analyses of corporations; examine the reproduction of culture at the corporate sites; or discuss specific businespractices (e.g., advertising) from the practitioners' perspective.

For the rest of the semester, we will critically read contemporary ethnographies addressing pressing issues such as nationalism, militarism, neoliberalism and fundamentalism. Throughout, we will investigate what it means not only to \"write women's worlds\", but also to analyze broader socio-cultural, political, and economic processes through a gendered lens. We will, finally, address the various ways feminist anthropology fundamentally challenged the discipline's epistemological certainties, as well as how it continues to transform our understanding of the foundations of the modern world.",

Students will gain valuable career skills in the cultural sector by learning the core tools and methodologies required assessing with heritage sites. Our weekly discussions will explore the ways that cultural policy can serve the public good but also the kinds of debates and problems that arise in the process. Class projects will build upon a partnership between the Penn Cultural Heritage Center and the U.S. Mission to UNESCO focused on the assessment of World Heritage Sites.",

We will collectively establish working definitions of key terms; review current literature and theoretical approaches to the analysis of public culture; compare modern features of publicness with pre-modern manifestations and functions of publics; and grapple with tensions created by the dichotomies of elite/non-elite and global/local.

This seminar also investigates the emergence of \"scientific\" approaches to labor and industrial organizations such as Tylorism, Fordism, and Toyotism and reveals how they ignore or utilize the \"cultural\" dimensions of workshops such as trust, autonomy, and \"human uncertainties.\" Finally, students will have a close look into the past and contemporary workshops under the heavy influence of intensifying global capitalism. By reading ethnographic writings about the work places in capitalist, socialist, and post-socialist countries, students can understand the work places as spaces where industrial workers are constantly made and unmade and where tensions and cooperation between \"localized\" labor and \"globalizing\" management are created. Examples of the work places under investigation are artisan workshops, industrialized farm fields, electronic assembly lines, garment factories, mine fields, fast-food restaurants and bank wiring rooms.",

    "course_description" : "From an evolutionary anthropology perspective, there have been several attempts at modeling the interaction between parental care patterns and different aspects of human life history. The salient characteristics of human history that are puzzling/paradoxical/unique are the long period of infant/child dependency, the rapid pace of reproduction, and the long period of post-reproductive life. Some models emphasize some life stages more than others, but all of them feature some form of intergenerational transfer as the key adaptation that has influenced the evolution of human life history. In this seminar, we would review several of these evolutionary grounded models that highlight the association between particular elements of care patterns and life history traits, including aging. We will review the data that provides support for the grandmother hypothesis, the embodied capital hypothesis, the pooled energy hypothesis, and intergenerational transfer hypothesis. We will also discuss possible trade-offs/constrains and directionality issues regarding the association between the evolution of cooperative parental care and longevity. Research with both human and non-human primates will be discussed.",

Neoliberlism-the ideology and accompanying policies and practices that champion the shifting of political decision making from the public sector to the private sector - has been widely recognized as having shown dramatic growth worldwide since the 1970s. It has also been widely regarded as a product of globalization. This course traces the history of neo-liberalism in global context with particular attention to neoliberalism's relationship to cities, and exam the role that urban growth has played in spurring neoliberal policies and practices. It asks how policy makers, voters, and private interest worldwide have responded to the growth of urban poverty and slums, challenges withing urban public education, unequal resource distribution, environmental pressures experienced within urban sanitation and waste disposal systems, and increased demands for municipal services like water, electricity, and transport infrastructures, and examines the rise of public-private partnerships, gated communities, initiatives to privatize education and municipal services, and efforts to relocate slum-dwellers and beautify cities as explicit strategies for attracting \"global capital\". The course also asks how the recent rise of neoliberal policies and practices differs from earlier market-driven and private sector led forms of political governance. The British and Dutch East India Companies are two famous examples of joint stock companies that assume administrative and political roles over their colonies. How did the rise of these colonial relationships differ from current neoliberal shifts. Readings will draw heavily from ethnographic and urban studies, scholarship on South Asia, as well as Latin America, South Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America, exploring what each of these specific contexts has to teach us more generally about the relationship between urbanization, global capitalism, public and private sectors, and political processes and decision making.",

We emphasize a transnational hemispheric perspective on the Americas in order to think through what was \"new\" about the \"new world\", long before Columbus landed in Hispaniola in 1492, as well as what continues to be new today as new people, products, and ideas continue to populate the region. Throughout the course, we will contextualize our questions about borderlands and frontiers, empires and colonialism, adaptations and creolizations, and politics and economics within a global frame. And finally, we will highlight the ways anthropologists from different backgrounds have contributed to public debates regarding the most pressing issues facing us today, and can work together to enrich our understandings of various contemporary problems.",

Beginning with silent films like The Vanishing American and moving forward to contemporary films written, directed, and acted by Native Americans, the class will progress from the study of stereotypical images of Hollywood films to the current era of the Native American Renaissance, which has produced films like Smoke Signals, Whale Rider, and The Fast Runner. Because the course is cross-listed in Religious Studies, English, and Anthropology, we will focus on the power of film to convey dimensions of Native American cultures that are more difficult to appreciate in written accounts. In other words, film is able to convey dimensions of the oral tradition, material culture, and spiritual significance of the land much more effectively because of the visual and audio components of the medium. The films will be situated in a richly nuanced historical and cultural context in order to provide students with a fuller sense of the Native cultures that are the subjects of the films studied during the semester.",

This course will explore the manner in which the Indian Ocean has played both roles throughout history, and how the nature of those divisions and connections has changed over time from the ancient to the modern world. We will reconstruct the intertwined mercantile, religious and kinship networks that spanned the Indian Ocean world, across the Middle East, East Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and China, illuminating the histories of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, while also considering the role of successive imperial political formations, from Rome to Britain. Throughout the semester we will seek to understand the Indian Ocean through the people who lived and worked in its milieu - from consuls and military commanders, to traders, brokers, sailors, prisoners and slaves. Course materials will draw on a variety of disciplines (anthropology, archaeology, material culture, religious studies) to construct the cultural, economic, and environmental history of the Indian Ocean.",

Happenings in the life sciences, including the discovery of new medicines, genes, and genomic processes, are re-drawing human experience and social relations. In the seminar, we will examine anthropological works that explore the impact of biomedicine (and its distinct forms of evidence-making, care, hope, and prognostication) on human ideations of time, agency, care and cure. We will address biomedical practice as it evolves at the borders of life and death: how do concepts of care evolve (or dissolve) at these borders? Care is fundamental to the managing of illness but it is often taken for granted or invisible. What are the emotional, technical, and political dimensions of caregiving? How does care remain hidden or become public (and political)? What kind of relations sustain openness towards care that biotechnical practice might foreclose? How do individuals, families, communities, or unexpected outsiders (ethnographers, for e.g.) step in to account for, or compensate for, absences of care in biomedical expertise? Under what conditions can a logic of care transform into cure? We will probe these questions in relation to chronic disease, addiction, mental health, global health, aging and dementia, addiction, trauma, for example. Our reflections will integrate the methods and persepectives of socialand cultural anthropology, the philosophy and history of science, and the social studies of science and technology, in addition to case studies, ethnographies, scientific and medical journals, documentary films and media reports.",

As a region in which there have been massive transplantations of peoples and their cultures from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and upon which the United States has exerted considerable influence, we will question the processes by which the meeting and mixing of peoples and cultures has occurred. Course readings include material on the political economy of slavery and the plantation system, family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies, popular culture, and the differing ways national, ethnic, and racial identities are expressed on the islands and throughout the Caribbean diaspora.",

Open to graduate and advanced undergraduate students, the workshop is a response to Amy Gutmann's call for interdisciplinary cooperation across the University and to the Department of Anthropology's commitment to developing public interest research and practice as a disciplinary theme. Rooted in the rubric of public interest social science, the course focuses on: 1) merging problem solving with theory and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice, racial harmony, equality, and human rights; and 2) engaging in public debate on human issues to make research results accessible to a broader audience. The workshop brings in guest speakers and will incorporate original ethnographic research to merge theory with action. Students are encouraged to apply the framing model to a public interest research and action topic of their choice. This is an academically-based-community-service (ABCS) course that partners directly with Penn's Netter Center for Community Partnerships.",

Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.",

Is ethnography even up to the task of answering contemporary questions based on social realities that can't just be captured with recourse to long-term immersion in a single hermetically cordoned-off and primitived village community somewhere? What kind of authority might ethnography (and the ethnographer) even claim to possess in an era of hyper-scientific assumptions about, say, human genomics and the statistical analyses of massive datasets, today's holy grails of social curiosity? The course tries to show that ethnography is not irrelevant or superfluous to serious questions about our contemporary socail world, but we will revisit basic assumptions about the nature of anthropological and sociological observation with the goal of strengthening the genre's/method's capacity to speak back to others' fixations on totalizing and absolutist forms of knowledge production. Students will examine how ethnographers are imagining ethnography anew and updating its traditional sensibilities to make sense of decidedly newfangled sociocultural worlds.",

The \"rule of law\" has developed tremendous moral force in international politics and legal language is becoming a key resource in daily life. The relationship between law and politics is becoming all the more critical in the contemporary period. By asking how relationships between legal, cultural and political realms are structured, we will study changing approaches to law in anthropological work. The course will examine how law provides tools for both social struggle and social control and will explore classical and contemporary texts in legal and political anthropology in order to detail the cultural dimensions of law and law's changing relationship to discipline.",

The first weekly meeting will be devoted to discussing readings related to the topic of an invited speaker presentation scheduled for the second weekly meeting. The invited speakers, from different schools at Penn and from other institutions, will interact directly with students in two occasions. Following the speaker presentation, there will be a first opportunity to engage in discussions with the speaker over a meal.

We will resist drawing premature conclusions about the pre-eminence of biological or cultural factors in the manifestation of identity or disease, and instead work to find an adequate language (and method of inquiry) to account for their interaction in specific bodies, populations, places, and times.

This seminar will examine the myth of the ecologically noble savage, the myth of the pristine environment, the alliance between native peoples and green politics, and the contribution of native peoples to appropriate technology, sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity.",

How have advances in media technologies (for instance, photography, telegraphy, film) served as mechanisms for re-imagining potential links between human speakers and otherworldly interlocutors?

    "course_description" : "In this course, we will first read from the diaries of Christopher Columbus about the Antilles, the ethnographic essays of Claude Levi-Strauss about Brazil, as well as the anthropological studies of Marcel Griaule about the Dogon people of Mali. These readings will crystallize a sense of the historical Euro-colonial gaze at peoples and places that it considered barbaric, feared, in some cases, as cannibalistic, and that it eventually came to categorize as \"third world\" by contributing to their economic underdevelopment. Rather than a lament of \"Europe's\" history of havoc, this course will show the cinematic reckonings of \"Third Cinema\" with this violent history, which visually re-frame and question what is human, what is civilized, and what is not. We will move by the third week into select films of Brazil, Cuba, Martinique, Africa (specifically Algeria, Mali, and Senegal), and see how they respond to \"Europe's\" idea that it is the center of the gravity of civilization. The cinemas of Glauber Rocha, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Tomas Gutierrez Alea, Sara Gomez, Euzhan Palcy, Manthia Diawara, Abderrahmane Sissako, and Ousmane Sembene radically tangle the dangerous line between the human and the anthropological object of study, between civilization and barbarism. The director's work that will be the conceptual hinge between the brief early readings and the aforementioned directors is that of Jean Rouch, specifically his pictures shot in Africa in the 1940s-60s. To accompany our viewings, we will also read the literature of the Antropofaga (Cannibalism) movement in early 20th century Brazil, the poetry of Aime Cesaire (Martiniquan), and a couple essays by the revolutionary thinker, Frantz Fanon (Martiniquan, Algerian).

Yet issues of bioethics and medical ethics arise everyday in the common situations of our lives, affecting our immediate health and well being and eventually that of the society around us. This seminar will examine this everyday bio/medical ethics from an ethnographic point of view. Topics include medical error, birth, death, population control, poverty, race global medical experimentation and corporate responsibility. We will read works by social scientists of medicine that chronicle ordinary people's struggles and the bioethics quandaries that accompany them, and in doing so will distinguish between the everyday moral experiences of people all over the world faced with difficult choices, and the ethical ideals to which they aspire. We will then ask: how can these perspectives be reconciled? When trying to reconcile these perspectives, how can we account for powerful dynamics of race, gender, class religion, and cultural difference that infuse everyday medical decision-making? And finally, how can we develop a code of ethics that takes these issues into account and is also fundamentally connected to the moral lives of the particular individuals who are affected? Is this even possible?",

    "course_description" : "This seminar examines anthropological approaches to the concept of class and social inequality through a close reading of a dozen ethnographies that deal with a broad definition of health, illness, and social suffering. Readings span many of the theoretical, political, sub-disciplinary, and area studies debates in anthropology and the larger fields of poverty, social inequality, international development, violence studies, science studies, governmentality, and social policy interventions over the past century. My hope is to explore a vitalized conceptualization of class to understanding contemporary and historical forms of social inequality as well as a critique of narrow biomedical understandings of illness and health. I hope to bring the problematic concept of power and the management of social inequality to bear on a contemporary critique of punitive neoliberalism into the center of our anthropological and public health concerns. The seminar also aims to bring students from anthropology, and other social science and humanities disciplines in dialogue with students in public health, social studies, and clinical medicine. Most of the readings address the links between the political structuring of larger historical, political and cutltural forces with the intimate, psycho-affective suffering and trauma of vulnerable catagories of individuals. We will examine anthropological texts within the schools of political economy, critical medical anthropology, post-colonial history, Foucauldian power relations, Bourdieusian cultural reproduction, science studies, symbolic interactionism, and critical Basaglian psychiatry. I am particularly interested in clarifying our understandings of Marx's concepts of class, class struggle, \"primitive accumulation\" and \"lumpenization\", Bourdieu's \"cultural capital\", \"habitus\" and \"symbolic violence\", the U.S. structure-agency ideological impasse, Taussig's \"culture of terror\" and \"space of death\", Primo Levi's \"gray zone\", Agamben's \"impossibility of witnessing\", Rose's neoliberal health citizen, Gramsci's hegemony, and Foucault's \"subjectivation\" \"biopower\" and disciplianry forms of governmentality among other useful theoretical formulations. We will be reading primarily ethnographies based on participant-observation methods that engage various schools of critical social science theory. We will also explore the contrasts between anthropological vs. literary vs. testimonial vs. political journalisitc vs. epidemiological approaches to the topics.",

We draw on film theory, psychoanalysis, literary analysis, cognitive theory, communication studies, and visual anthropology to discuss several key issues related to the state of film/filmmaking in an age of \"digital\" media. We interrogate contentious notions of authority, reflexivity, and objectivity. We analyze film's claim to \"realistic\" (iconic and indexical) representation. We interrogate how \"film\" and \"video\" get imagined in all their visual particularity, sometimes conflated into a single visual form and at other moments distinguished as a function of the difference between photochemical and electro-magnetic processes. We also highlight the kinds of techniques filmmakers use to thematize these same issues \"on screen.\" Students will be responsible for watching one film each week (along with the course readings), and part of the final project involves helping to produce a group documentary/ethnographic \"film\" that engages the course's central concerns.",

These developments have generated uncertainty, fear and conflict as well as opportunities for developing greater understanding and forming new solidarities. They have also sparked what some refer to as an \"interfaith movement,\" initiatives seeking to bridge divides between faith communities and build on common visions of the social good in collaborative service and social change efforts. This public anthropology course will be co-taught by Professor Kathy Hall, Associate Chaplain Steve Kocher, and Associate Director of the Greenfield Intercultural Center, Fatimah Muhammad. It will explore interfaith movements in the public sphere through a combination of academic study and practical experience. We will consider anthropological theories and debates surrounding issues of modernity, the cultural politics of difference, and issues of secularism and religion in the public sphere and apply these theories to an examination of the history of interfaith efforts and case studies of recent initiatives. Students will participate in service alongside Philadelphia area faith based organizations and in an intensive spring break service project. Students of all religious and non-religious backgrounds will have the to engage one another and gain greater understanding of different faith traditions, experiences, and beliefs. The course will prepare students for leadership in facilitating dialogue around interfaith issues and coordinating interfaith community-building and service projects on campus and in their future careers.",

This is NOT a comprehensive history of the discipline. Instead, we will examine some of the main issues that have been foundational to anthropology, and will explore how approaches to these issues have changed over time. To do so, we will contextualize our analysis of transformations in anthropological knowledge production within historical and contemporary political economies. By exploring core issues that continue to inspire and inform anthropological theory and ethnographic practice, we will solidify our commitment to a holistic and relational understanding of social processes.",

Course discussions will begin by examining how capitalism contributed to the formation of a nationalist bourgeois class and how this \"historical\" class took a key role in creating the concepts of nation, national territory and unified national market. We will investigate how people and local communities reacted to the changes caused by these spreading ideas. By reading about the various forms and ideas of nation and nationalism, students can understand how the unique conditions of a specific locale have affected their formation, sometimes with destructive consequences, examining cases both from \"the West\" and \"the rest\". In the case of the West we will firstly look into the constructive role of bourgeois class during the French Revolution and how they created the ideal form of a nation, which has clearly divided national territories, a national language and a national education system, army, and most of all, a unified national market. Later we will discuss how the image of the ideal nation has been transferred to other places and transformed according to the specific local situations. For these cases, we will analyze the fledgling democracy of the new colony of Great Britain (the U.S.), the primordial nationalism of Japan and Korea (both North and South), the emerging patriotic nationalism of China, the process of nation building in the Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, the militant/jingoistic nationalism of the post-socialist countries such as Russia, and so on.",

    "course_description" : "Venus was the God of Beauty and Love yet she was married to Hephaestus, the mangled, grumpy and for all intents and purposes, ugly god. Why juxtapose such distinct figures? Are they doing the same job? The course discusses the interplay between ugliness and politics with focus on a number of central concepts such as race, social conflict, nationalism, ideology, dictatorship, propaganda and autonomy. Emphasis is put on the double role of the deployment of ugliness, as reinforcement of ideological and political ideas and as a force of social criticism. How does the state justify its own existence by the use of aesthetic narratives? How does the State identify undesirables? This class highlights how groups who feel somatically alike behave, and how their boundaries form and change over time. The focus will be interdisciplinary and multi-national, with case studies from past and present. The class will have a digital media focus as we will delve into issues of representation particularly with respect to race. For example, we will delve into the aesthetic discussion of northern and southern Sudanese as well and Hitler's Germany. The aim of the course is to locate ugliness within a larger framework of ethnic conflict and nation building practices. My hope is to extend discussions of ugliness beyond the confines of aesthetics and situate it at the intersection of nationalism, power and citizenship. Beauty and ugliness, so easily relegated to individual preference, are linked indissolubly to gender, power and race relations in nation building projects. As Pierre Bourdieu (1984) observes, nothing is more distinctive, more distinguished, than the capacity to confer aesthetic status on objects that are banal or even 'common'. And these aesthetic distinctions, consciously and deliberately or not, fulfill a social function of legitimating social differences.",

Archaeologists, however, rarely consider these phenomena - dismissing them as decorative pageantry, \"mere rituals,\" that can do little to address more important economic or political processes. Yet performances can be central to the articulation of political and social identity. Indeed, spaces of performance are often also spaces of political negotiation - where power relations can be established, affirmed, debated, and undermined. This class will study the interplay between space, performance, and politics through time and across space. How do social events, festivals and theater performances affect the production of achitectural space? How are understandings of ritual and political spaces embedded in the architectural layout of a nomadic camp, village, or city? What is the relationship between ritual, performance, and politics? We will address these questions using theories drawn from a variety of disciplines including anthropology, sociology, psychology, religious studies, geography, architecture and cultural studies. Students will be required to write a research paper that applies the concepts discussed in the seminar to a topic of their choice. Although many of the case studies will be archaeological, the readings and discussions will be broadly theoretical and would appeal to students interested in the politics of space, ritual or performance from other fields.",

In others, people struggle for survival amid new and reemerging epidemics and have little or no access to basic or life-saving therapies. Treatments for infectious diseases that disproportionately affect the world's poor remain under-researched and global health disparities are increasing. This interdisciplinary seminar integrates perspectives from the social sciences and the biomedical sciences to explore 1) the development and global flows of medical technologies; 2) how the health of individuals and groups is affected by medical technologies, public policy, and the forces of globalization as each of these impacts local worlds. This course is a Benjamin Franklin Seminar. The seminar is structured to allow us to examine specific case material from around the world (Haiti, South Africa, Brazil, Russia, China, India, for example), and to address the ways in which social, political-economic, and technological factors -- which are increasingly global in nature -- influence basic biological mechanisms and disease outcomes and distribution. As we analyze each case and gain familiarity with ethnographic methods, we will ask how more effective interventions can be formulated. The course draws from historical and ethnographic accounts, medical journals, ethical analyses, and films, and familiarizes students with critical debates on globalization and with local responses to globalizing processes.",

The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns, through health-promoting moderation arguments, to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses, where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus, or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community.",

Heritage has become inscribed in the planning of urban and rural landscapes, designed as tourist destinations, and considered a universal good in global cosmopolitan society. But it would be well to ask: what kind of \"nature\" and \"culture\" has been labeled as heritage? What kind of organizations, economics, and politics are necessary to sustain it? How are these put in place? By whom? For whom? Over the course of the semester, students will engage with readings that discuss how cultural and natural heritage is communicated to the public and the relationship between academic critique and pragmatic social engagement. This seminar is further grounded by a partnership between the Penn Cultural Heritage Center and the U.S. Mission to UNESCO focused on the assessment of World Heritage Sites, and students will have the opportunity to learn from and participate in specific case studies.",

Combining these focus areas, this course will deal with critical research and the evaluation of programs organized around academically-based community service (ABCS) with a focus on social change. As part of the course, students will conduct an evaluation of an actively-running Netter Center/Penn program designed to improve quality of life and/or health status among West Philadelphia children, youth and families to support a mutually-beneficial partnership. The focus of the evaluation will be dependent upon student interest, the number of students in the course, and program needs.",

Also it aims to provide hands-on experience in both the management and analysis of ceramic assemblages, using one or more archaeological collections housed at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. The course will emphasize current theoretical approaches to ceramic analysis (from symbolic style to technological signatures), as well as basic collections management techniques (photography, databases, etc.).

Individuals struggle to afford medications; whole populations are neglected, considered too poor to constitute profitable markets for the development and distribution of necessary drugs. This seminar analyzes the dynamics of the burgeoning international pharmaceutical trade and the global inequalities that emerge from and are reinforced by market-driven medicine. Questions about who will be treated and who will not filter through every phase of pharmaceutical production --from preclinical research to human testing, marketing, distribution, prescription, and consumption. Whether considering how the pharmaceutical industry shapes popular understandings of mental illness in North America and Great Britain, how Brazil has created a model of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment program, or how the urban pooer in Delhi understand and access healthcare, the seminar draws on anthropological case studies to illuminate the roles of corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals in relation to global pharmaceuticals. As we analyze each case and gain famliarity with tehnographic methods, we will ask how individual and group health is shaped by new medical technologies and their evolving regulatory regimes and markets. The course familiarizes students with critical debates on globalization and with local responses to globalizing processes; and it contributes to ethical and political debates on the development and access to new medical technologies.",

Throughout, we explore ontologies of sound; sonic occurrences in religious structures, public processions, and pilgrimage sites; the construction of religion and ritual as ideas forged through colonial encounter and modern scholarship on religion; the politics of sacred sounds in today's public spaces and contemporary media, such as television and online; and the surprising fluidity between popular and sacred musical genres.",

After providing the basic principles of evolutionary biology, the course will examine the development of sexual anatomy and physiology. How is sex determined? How is orgasm achieved? Why do girls and boys develop sexually at different ages? The role of ecology and social life in shaping human mating patterns will be evaluated through the use of ethnographies and cross-cultural materials on a variety of human cultures. Does everybody have sex the way we do? Why marry? Are there biological bases for love? Why do we experience jealousy? Finally, topics relevant to human sexuality today will be discussed, such as recreational sex, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases. Examples are drawn primarily from traditional and modern human societies; data from studies of nonhuman primates are also considered.",

Our course discussion begins with a critical investigation into traditional societies based on patriarchy, Confucian ethics, and subsistence agriculture and how they have changed since their initial encounters with expanding global capitalism. This course then examines how the recently intensifying transnational movements of capital, commodities, people, and \"cultures\" have created particular cultural and societal forms in the region. Drawing on ethnographic, historical, and political literature about the three countries, students can understand how the particular culture and economy of each country has contributed to creating different paths of their historical-cultural transformations. Our topics include: changes in traditional families and gender roles, international wars and massive modernization movements; corporate culture and its local variations; domestic and international labor migration and the conditions of migrant workers; international marriages and transnational flow of brides; US-based fast food restaurants and food crisis; emerging consumerism and commodification of childhood; \"odorless\" Japanese cultural products and their popularity in Asian countries.",

This task is part of a life-long process, or journey, which begins in one's family of origin and is shaped by the cultural life plan while growing up. Features of the life plan involve creative reflection, taking risks, learning from errors and failures, assessing one's feelings, revising one's operating knowledge, altering one's goals and taking the next steps forward. Life stories then become the repository of one's steps along the way, sometimes challenged by experiences in extreme situations and at other times facilitated by the rituals of our lives. Fulfillment becomes a product of the process of appraisal and of the means of coping with the exigencies of life, including its culmination and ending.",

More specifically, this course traces in detail the changes of Chinese family and kinship, which have been the social and ideological backbone of Chinese society. During the first half of this course we deal with the dominant social organizations, practices and ideaologies of the pre-revolutionary Chinese society. During the latter half of this course, we analyze the social movements and policies of the CCP and their impacts on the everyday life of Chinese people. We will discuss, for example, the origins and specific policies of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and their effects on the lineage and family. This course deals with land collectivization, anti-superstition campaigns, marriage reforms, \"praise of youth\", and their multiple influences on the traditional hierarchy based on age and gender differences. About the changes after Mao, we will discuss internal migration and inheritance patterns, the agricultural responsibility system and household economies, emerging capitalist labor market and gender roles, the single-child family policy and the invention of \"childhood\", increasing popularity of neolocality and the triumph of conjugality.",

Happenings in the life sciences, including the discovery of new genes, pathways, and processes, are redrawing concepts of the body and human nature and refiguring social and political relations. The seminar starts from the premise that scientific facts are made, not things existing a priori in the world and that are merely picked up by researchers and consumed by lay audiences. Likewise, technologies are created through a process of intense negotiation between producers and their sophisticated users. Focusing on the biosciences, we explore the production of science and technology and how they 1)affect individuals, self-identities, subjectivity, kinship, and social relationships; 2)have interacted with or reinforced political programs, racial classifications, unequal access to knowledge, and patterns of social injustice; 3)inform contemporary institutional structures, strategies of governance, and practices of citizenship. We will combine methods and perspectives from social and cultural anthropology, and the social studies of science and technology, and will draw from historical case studies, contemporary ethnographies of science, scientific and medical journals, documentary films and media reports.

Caribbean musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics, ritual, communication, religion, and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Caribbean contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism, migration, ethnicity, hybridity, syncretism, and globalization. Each of these concepts, moreover, will be explored with a view toward understanding its connections to the central analytical paradigm of the course-- diaspora. Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music, ranging from calypso to junkanoo, from rumba to merengue, and from dancehall to zouk. We will then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relations to our own North-American contexts of music consuption and production.",

With the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs we know far more about Maya politics, economy, warfare, and religion, along with the basis for recent predictions of the apocalypse. Knowledge of the Maya past allows us to better understanding the processes inherent in the evolution of all human societies, and is crucial to understanding today's Maya people who live in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and the USA.",

But we can also see similar tales in our own contemporary American culture, especially in the form of blockbuster movies.

For the rest of the semester, we will critically read contemporary ethnographies addressing pressing issues such as nationalism, militarism, neoliberalism and fundamentalism. Throughout, we will investigate what it means not only to \"write women's worlds\", but also to analyze broader socio-cultural, political, and economic processes through a gendered lens. We will, finally, address the various ways feminist anthropology fundamentally challenged the discipline's epistemological certainties, as well as how it continues to transform our understanding of the foundations of the modern world.",

The \"rule of law\" has developed tremendous moral force in international politics and legal language is becoming a key resource in daily life. The relationship between law and politics is becoming all the more critical in the contemporary period. By asking how relationships between legal, cultural and political realms are structured, we will study changing approaches to law in anthropological work. The course will examine how law provides tools for both social struggle and social control and will explore classical and contemporary texts in legal and political anthropology in order to detail the cultural dimensions of law and law's changing relationship to discipline.",

We will examine both infectious and non-infectious diseases, and assess the way in which populations and disease organisms have co-evolved. Related issues to be examined are the nature of the virulence and pathogenicity of infectious agents, and their efforts to subvert the immune system's responses to infection. In addition, we will explore the evolved responses that enable individuals to protect, heal and recuperate themselves from infections and injuries, such as fever and sickness behavior, and the fitness enhancing aspects of these processes. Finally, we will investigate how past adaptations of early humans to their environments now affects modern humans, who have very different diets, life expectancy, activity patterns, and hygiene than their ancestors.",

Later we will analyze the increasingly complex cultural and social landscapes of the Post-Mao China: How did the one-child policy contribute to the rediscovery of childhood and the emerging consumer culture in China? Have the new job opportunities created by the socialist market economy improved women's status? What are the effects of multinational corporations on local communities?

Readings span many of the theoretical, political,sub-disciplinary and area studies debates in anthropology and the larger fieldsof poverty, social inequality, international development, cultural studies, peace, and conflict research and violence studies over the past century. My hope is to bring the subjects of urban poverty, war, legacies of colonialism, violence, social suffering and a critique of neoliberal governmentality into the center of the disciplines of anthropology and public health specifically and the social sciences, humanities and medicine more broadly. In the seminar we will (hopefully) be bringing students from anthropology, and other social science and humanities disciplines in dialogue with students in public health, science studies, and clinical medicine. Many of the readings and discussions will be concerned with the links between intimate suffering at the level of the individual and the political structuring of larger historical, political and cultural forces. This requires an understanding of the concepts of political economy, colonial/post-colonial history, the emergence of modern subjectivities, and the continuum of structural, symbolic, political and everyday violence. We will be reading primarily ethnographies based on qualitative participant-observation methods and driven by critical social science theory, but we will also explore the contrasts between anthropological vs. literary vs. testimonial vs. political journalistic vs. epidemiological forms of addressing the topics.",

When is religious conversion \"colonization of conciousness\"? Does spirit possession provide a means for subordinated or marginalized persons to \"speak back\" against the dominant? Do those who seek to subordinate their ow will to God's (often transmitted through human authorities) \"have agency\"? Rather than seeking to answer these questions, we will use ethnographic and historical studies (e.g.Isabelle Nobakov, Saba Mahmood, Talal Asad, Rachel Fukton, Michel de Certeau, Webb Keane), as well as a few philosophical ones (Volosinov, MacIntyre, Strawson, Augustine), to think about the taken-for- granted the political-moral and scholarly framework, that generates such questions in the first place.",

As a region in which there have been massive transplantations of peoples and their cultures from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and upon which the United States has exerted considerable influence, we will quesiton the processes by which the meeting and mixing of peoples and cultures has occurred. Course readings include material on the political economy of slavery and the plantation system, family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies, popular culture, and the differing ways national, ethnic, and racial identities are expressed on the islands and throughout the Caribbean diaspora.",

Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text, performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command, rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish \"ceremonial law\" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired, and they ridiculed Jews for practicing \"carnal\" rather than \"spiritual\" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory, students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales, from biblical times through the present. Students will also examine the perception and portrayal of Jewish customs in Christian theological, political and proto-ethnographic writings from the 7th -16th centuries.

From the rise of transnational religious networks, to controversial legal challenges to religious rights, to state-sponsored trials for religious minorities, the issues remain critical and volatile. In this light, this course explores contemporary issues dealing with the dueling principles of religious freedom set alongside cultural practices and the role of the nation-state in managing, accommodating and disengaging with protections based on religious difference and legal questions. By examining recent and emerging scholarship on religious practices embedded in legal/political/moral controversies, the central goal is to explore the ways that new uses of religion and the law are changing the ways that scholars are engaging these topics. The course will be taught in seminar format and students will engage with the historical, theoretical and ethnographic literature on this topic. Themes will range from formations of secularism and genealogies of religion, debates over freedom and its fictions, and the social construction of law as it relates to dilemmas over pluralism, evidentiary questions and anthropological interrogations of the role of trials.",

We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past, reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the \"hard\" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens. You will also have the opportunity, during recitations, to conduct hands-on exercises collecting and analyzing behavioral, morphological, and genetic data on both humans and nonhuman primates and working with the Department of Anthropology's extensive collection of fossil casts.",

Through the methods of anthropology, science and technology studies and political economy, we will focus primarily on technological development and innovation in contemporary China. We will consider a wide range of ethnographies, case studies, and historical accounts in order to ask the following questions: What are some of the discourses of evaluation which make possible changing views of East Asian economies by economists, officials, businesspeople and laborers? What does it mean to identify and characterize national economic cultures in the region, for example, those supposedly timeless markers of Chinese economic distinctiveness like the concept of guanxi? And lastly, how do divergent conceptions of technological development make possible new forms of life and labor?",

How does the body enact the discourses that constitute it? How do our ways of imagining and interpreting the body bear on our ways of ordering the social and natural world? How is the body's dual status as both mode and object of knowing (Stewart) negotiated in ethnographic and scientific practice? How might a more humanistic ethnography undo and displace the dualisms of mind and body, body and self, and perhaps even return us to the body as a measure of all things (Harvey)?

Middle school students will learn about the food environment and about why culture matters when we talk about food. Topics include traditional and modern foodways, ethnic cuisine in America, food preferences, and 'American cuisine'. The course integrates classroom work about food culture and anthropological practice with frequent trips to middle schools where undergraduates will collaborate with students, their teachers, and a teacher partner from the Agatson Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI). Students will be required to attend one of two time blocks each week to fulfill the service learning requirement- Mondays or Wednesdays 3-6pm for the Spring 2015 semester. Undergraduates will be responsible for weekly writing assignments responding to learning experience in the course, for preparing materials to use with middle school children, for being participant-learners with the middle school children and for a final research project. The material for the course will address the ideas underlying university-community engagement, the relationships that exist between food/eating and culture, and research methods.",

Using critical thinking skills from anthropology, students and instructor will explore meanings of fat: their origin, their effects on individuals, and on society. In particular, we will examine ideas taken for granted by society (especially the biomedical culture, as it extends into the community) about the relations between food, fatness, happiness, health and morality. Course material draws broadly from the social sciences and humanities and deals with the biological, biomedical, and socio- cultural aspects of fat in our culture. In saying \"fat\", we are also implicitly saying \"thin\", and this course is designed to delve into the varied discourse on fat/thin, on body/body image, health, and beauty.",

    "course_description" : "There is a great deal of variation among population groups in the incidence of and mortality from most major diseases. Biological and social factors can account for some of this variation. However, there is increasing evidence that behavior- and the cultural models that are linked to health behavior- play an important role, too. Cognitive anthropology is the study of how people in social groups conceive of objects and events in their world. It provides a framework for understanding how members of different groups categorize illness and treatment. It also helps to explain why risk perception, help-seeking behavior, and decision-making styles vary to the extent they do. This seminar will explore the history of cognitive anthropology, schema theory, connectionism, the role of cultural models, and factors affecting health decision making. Methods for identifying cultural models will be discussed and practiced. Implications for health communication will be discussed.",

Lectures focus on how archaeology can be manipulated to authenticate such fraudulent examples as the lost continent of Atlantis, the Piltdown man, ancient giants roaming the earth, and alien encounters. Background on the cultures to which such hoaxes have been attributed is given to refute their authenticity. Less clear-cut cases, such as the gold of Troy or the snake goddesses of Minoan Crete are carefully dissected to allow students to make their own conclusions on contested finds. Students explore why archaeology is particularly susceptible to biased interpretation designed to support nationalistic ideologies, religious causes, and even modern stereotypes. They discuss how archaeology has been used, both correctly and incorrectly, as propaganda in the modern world. Finally, the course explores careful archaeological method and how, as a social science, archaeology is capable of rejecting such interpretations about the past.",

The course will consider the underlying social, political, economic and cultural conditions that magnify disasters, and critically examine how disasters expose the fault lines of social inequality embedded in society. Additionally, we will attend to ways in which disasters are presented and represented visually; exploring the repercussions of the 24 hour news cycle that consign disasters to the level of public spectacle and overlook recovery efforts. This course will offer students the opportunity to improve their public speaking skills as they analyze cases of disasters and their aftermath in a variety of speaking assignments including multi-media presentations. Classroom discussions and debates about topics such as the ethics of emergency aid and expert versus local problem solving strategies will provide additional speaking practice.",

These gatherings of hundreds of exhibitors and millions of visitors were the Internet of their day: a way to exchange information, explore new technologies, meet foreigners, promote commerce, and exhibit art. They were seen as encyclopedias, or miniature worlds, that gathered together all of human knowledge in one place. For the colonial powers of the Victorian era, it was also a way to boldly display the natural resources they controlled and the peoples they conquered. For the discipline of anthropology, the fairs provided an opportunity to define itself as an essential tool in understanding this rapidly changing world. The history of anthropology is intimately tied to the ways native people were displayed at the fairs. We will focus on how indigenous groups and Native American participated in the fairs, how official anthropological exhibits were often overshadowed by midway sideshows, how women and African-Americans asserted themselves by designing their own exhibits, and how disputed evolutionary principles guided the exhibitions well into the 20th century. The class will make use of the world's fair collection in the Penn Museum and the Van Pelt Library as well as other resources in Philadelphia.",

The goal of the course is to explore the founding tenets of anthropological inquiries and methods and to ponder how those developments contributed to anthropological understandings of Africa in the scholarly imagination. By asking why particular questions emerged and how those inquiries were presented, we will explore the social and political contexts in which particular studies emerged and assess the coherence and value of those analyses.

In this coursewe will use anthropological texts to explore the ways in which young Africans are both socialized into and also play an active role in negotiating the terms of democracy. In doing so, we will look both at the great diversity in democratic ideals across the continent as well as the perceived failures of many African nations to transition to constitutional democracies. We will use a variety of examples from recent history to examine these issues, such as the recent youth uprising in Egypt and its use of social media as a tool of democracy, the role of youth in apartheid-era political protest in South Africa, and the complex intersection of indigenous politics and democratic legislation in Tanzania. This course will engage key debates in current anthropological analysis, asking about both young people's capacity for agency as well as the formation of political subjectivity.",

    "course_description" : "The goal of this course is to understand and to investigate both historical and contemporary issues related to a culture of consumption. Reading topics cover both contemporary and scholarly issues in cultural anthropology, popular culture, consumer behavior, off-shore production, social networking, media and communications, financial and real estate markets and marketing. Class distinctions are equally interdisciplinary as we focus on investigating and identifying critical global/local linkages. We analyze the various ways in which Philadelphia and other \"global cities\" are competing for consumer revenues. We ask what factors have led contemporary society reaching its current stage of mass consumption and how have certain goods and services been reconfigured, packaged or re-packaged to attract new consumers. In order to better understand the link between consumption and production factors we explore the relationship between outsourcing and/or offshore production and modern consumption. Approximately sixty percent of the seminar takes place in the classroom and will include lecture, class discussion, and films. The remaining half of the class meetings will involve local and regional travel. Research assignments emphasize the use of anthropological participant-observation techniques to investigate the relationships between culture and contemporary mass consumption within the contexts of re-gentrification, urbanization and globalization.",

We will survey a number of theoretical and ethnographic texts that explore the complexity of global health, while questioning its stability and coherence as a self-same object and field of study. Whatever global health might be, it is more often then not actively produced through a range of moral and ethical commitments of multiple expert cultures, social movements and laypersons.

The seminar will start by outlining the ancient and modern history of the Middle East, and reviewing the production of cultural heritage and its contemporary management in several Middle Eastern countries. It will then proceed to discuss the following major topics: Cultural diversity of modern Middle Eastern societies, the perception of cultural heritage in these societies, and the survival of long-living historical places, old traditions and material culture of all kinds. 1) Cultural diversity of modern Middle Eastern societies, the perception of cultural heritage in these societies, and the survival of long-living historicaplaces, old traditions and material culture of all kinds. 2) The influence of ancient cultures on common fixation and beliefs of modern identity in Middle Eastern societies (e.g. particular ethnic and religious grousee themselves as direct descendents of one or a number of ancient groups such as Phoenicians, Israelites, Assyrians). 3) The use of archeological and historical data to create narratives of the past that promote specific political ideologies in the modern Middle East and, in some cases fabricate novel cultural and political realities. 4) The damage done to Cultural Heritage by recent wars in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, and (i) how these wars are/were the makers of a new time that disrupted the living past through the destruction of cultural landscapes; and (ii) the involvement of cultural heritage institutions and archaeologists in rescuing cultural heritage in the event of war.",

Case studies from various cultures, including Northern Europe, the Near East, North America, and the Andes, will be used to elucidate these processes and their cultural dimensions.
