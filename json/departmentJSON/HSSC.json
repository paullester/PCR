    "course_description" : "This course will review major developments in biomolecular sciences and Many historians of science, technology and medicine have embraced the study of popular culture in recent years. They have drawn on a rich literature in mainstream history, on the history of reading, of the book, of museums, of oral culture, journalism, theater, and of the mass media including radio and television. Some have even proposed that popular culture provides insights into elite knowledge systems that are not accessible in other kinds of sources,thus privileging what is publicly known over the traditional private textual, visual and material records of the archive or museum. In this graduate research seminar we will be exploring the relevance of the study of popular culture to the history of science, technology and medicine. Participants will write an original research paper in which they draw on popular culture as a resource for the interpretation of practices, theories and material resources in natural knowledge systems. Readings will generally focus on surveys that explicitly discuss methods, though we will also read some primary sources possibly including science fiction texts, memoirs of patients, engineers, physicians and scientists, gee-whiz popular science books, and didactic books intended for children.",

In addition to analyzing specific examples, both of particular sciences and of particular imperial/colonial situations, we will be taking a critical look at some of the explanatory and theoretical models of science in its imperial context that have been offered by historians and sociologists. And we will be discussing whether such models help or hinder historians in their work.",

This course traces the history of the medicalization thesis, from its beginnigns with Michel Foucault and Ivan Illich to its latest articulation put forth by sociologist Peter Conrad. Once we are accustomed to the multiple meanings of medicalization, we will put them each under scrutiny, borrowing from literature in the history of religion (a subfield that has grappled with the predominance of the secularization thesis, a theory very much akin to medicalization), as well as from the history of the body. In short, the goal of this course is to read current works in the history of medicine in order problematize the theory of medicalization.",

We will begin with Lovejoy's Great Chain of Being and critiques brought against it, moving to classic histories of scientific ideas with a focus on \"mechanical philosophy\" followed by recent rethinkings of \"the Scientific Revolution.\" We will then visit major schools of historical interpretation: Foucault's geneaologies of knowledge and power, Marxist criticism and the Frankfurt School, Max Weber's analysis of rationalization and the values of science, along with philosophical approaches to technoscience, biopower, the state of exception and artificial life. Throughout, our guiding questions will be the relationship between scientific knowledge and institutions, practices, technologies and values, as well as the connection between local case studies and the \"big picture\" of science and technology in the modern world. The seminar is open to graduate students from any discipline who want to engage critically with these works.",

    "course_description" : "The history of computing is about more than just the electronic digital computer. It is the story of a wide range of human activities, scientific practices, and technological developments. The story begins in the early 19th century with the emergence of new demands for information management -- from scientific researchers, expanding government bureaucracies, and increasingly national and international corporations. It includes not only \"computers\" (itself a large and diverse category) but data processing, communications, and visualization technolgoeis, as well as people, practices and organizational structures. In this course we will explore the history of computing in all of its forms and varieties. We will situate the computer in the broader history of technology, but also consider it from the perspectives of the history of science, labor history and social history.",

    "course_description" : "Postcolonial Theories, building largely on Frankfurt School theorists, have critiqued the totalizing aspirations of what it calls 'Enlightenment Rationality'. Such critiques have also fed a range of critiques of Science. At the heart of such critiques is a rather restricted and plastic idea of Science as a singular, homogenous body of knowledge that has steadily promoted the disenchantment of the world. In this course we seek to destablize this monolithic vision of science by revisiting its plural, heterogeneous histories. The course is particularly interested in exploring the historical entanglements between the sciences and the enchanted world of intangible entities such as spirits, ghosts and gods. The course will be divided into three broad sections. The first will deal with the theoretical critiques of 'Enlightenment Rationality' and 'Science' in postcolonial theory. The second will undertake a detailed and loosely chronological examination of the multifaceted entanglements of science and technology with the paranormal in the 19th and 20th centuries. Finally, the last section will explore the performative aspects of scientific rationality in colonial and postcolonial contexts in a bid to understand the background that led to the postcolonial theorization.",
