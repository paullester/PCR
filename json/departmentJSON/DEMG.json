The course also covers a history and evaluation of immigration policies around the world, and devotes signification attention to theoretical and empirical perspectives on immigrant adaptation. Within this larger topic, we will also discuss internal migration and urbanization; the relationship between gender and migration; the spatial distribution of immigrants within the United States, immigrant communities, and ethnic enclaves; and the undocumented population in the United States.",

Ethnographic, interview, survey, experimental and historical/comparative research methods will be covered. Four themes will be explored: 1) the basics of solid research design, 2) the various advantages and disadvantages of each method, 3) when the use of a method is appropriate or inappropriate for the research question, and 4) how to evaluate researchers' claims on the basis of the evidence they present. These themes will be explored by reading examples of and conducting exercises designed to give students hands-on experience in each of the methods. Students will conduct the exercises on a topic of their choice, which together will culminate in their final paper. The course is required and restricted to second year students in sociology and demography.",

PP II is divided into two parts. The first focuses on family demography and the biological, social and demographic factors explaining levels, trends, and differentials in human fertility transition with an emphasis on the historical and current course of fertility transition in developed and developing countries. The second part of the course provides a comprehensive review of theories and research on international migration. Readings examine patterns and processes of global migration during the classic age from 1800-1914 as well as during the postwar period from 1945 to the present. The course also covers a history and evaluation of immigration policies around the world, and devotes significant attention to theoretical and empirical perspectives on immigrant adaptation, including the relationship between gender and migration.",

Topics discussed in the course include: How do economic changes affect marriage, divorce, and child bearing decisions? How do households make decisions about transfers and requests? How can economic and sociological approaches be combined in explanatory models of demography change? How does immigration to the US affect the ethnic composition of the population, the earnings of native workers, taxes on natives, and the macro-economy? What causes the aging of populations, and how will population aging affect the economies of industrial nations, and in particular, pension programs like Social Security? What accounts for the rise in women's participation in the wage labor force over the past century? How are family composition and poverty interrelated? Does rapid population growth slow economic development with low income countries? In addition to these topics, the course also covers selected methods not included in Dem/Soc 535/536 and 609.",

Students will use survey data from the baseline and 12 month wave of the Fragile Families study (described at http://crcw.princeton.edu/fragilefamilies/), a national survey of unwed and married parents who have just had a child (with unmarried parents over sampled) They will also use transcripts and coded data from the TLC3 study, which involved qualitative couple and individual interviews conducted with a subset of 75 of the couples in the FF survey in 3 waves: about 3 months after the birth and then again 12 and 24 months after the birth. Most of these are low-income, unmarried, cohabiting parents. The goal of the course is for each student to use these two data sets, and the analytic techniques and literature covered in the course, to write a paper that can be submitted for publication. The spring will also include lots of tips on how to construct a publishable paper. Students should only enroll in this course if they plan to take the spring sequel course as well.",
