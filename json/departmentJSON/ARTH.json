Stretching from the American and French Revolutions to the eve of World War I, topics to be covered include: the rise of capitalist and industrialist culture, art and revolutionary upheaval, global travel and empire, the origins of modernist art and architecture, and new media such as stereoscopes, iron and glass construction, and photography. Major artistic personalities of the age, from Jacques-Louis David and Gustave Courbet to Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh, and from Friedrich Schinkel and, Baron Haussmann to Frank Furness and Frank Lloyd Wright, are discussed. Each lecture will be followed by a brief period of discussion, and regular field trips take students to examine art and architecture first hand, in the museums and on the streets of Philadelphia.",

How have attitudes toward death and its architecture changed across time and cultures? How do cemeteries and places of death, mourning, and memorial contribute to the formation of social identity? The proposed course will consist of class and fieldwork components. In class, students will learn to critically engage with essential scholarship on the history and architecture of death, as they encounter iconic cemeteries from antiquity to the present. In fieldwork exercises, students will explore Philadelphia s cemeteries and develop familiarity with basic skills in architectural documentation, 3D drawing, and digital mapping in the study of individual graves, family plots, and mausolea. A series of projects and book reviews completed over the course of the semester will stand in lieu of a final exam or paper.",

    "course_description" : "Topic varies. Spring 2015: Among the functional genres shaping religious imagery in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the altarpiece is arguably the most important, and many of the most famous panel paintings that hang today in museums originated as components of altarpieces. The altarpiece in the Latin church bridged the divide between clergy and laypeople, between cult and devotion, between public acclaim and private interests. Such altarpieces developed into extraordinarily dynamic vehicles for staging the religious image, akin to mural painting (in its potential for narrative elaboration), and manuscript illumination (in its potential for interchanging and juxtaposing imagery). As an umbrella for diverse research projects in both medieval and Renaissance art, this seminar affords an overview of the origins, development and articulation of the altarpiece as a functional and pictorial genre in European art, on both sides of the Alps. It also seeks to provide students with the materials and practical training--technical, scholarly, interpretative-- required to study altarpieces as visual, narrative, and material totalities.",

    "course_description" : "Topic varies. Spring 2015: Double axes, horns of consecration, and images of a prominent female goddess were powerful cult symbols for both the Minoans and the Mycenaeans. And indeed, it was originally thought that these two cultures practiced the same religion. But closer examination of textual and archaeological evidence reveals that despite the similarities in their respective iconographies, the religions had significant differences, differences that must have arisen from their different cultural backgrounds. In this course we will look at many different types of evidence Linear A and B texts, archaeological sites and mortuary remains, cult objects such as rhyta and figurines, and artistic renderings of religious scenes found on gold rings and frescoes so that together we can attempt to reconstruct the ritual practices of these religions. We will also use these physical manifestations to consider more broadly the nature not only of the Minoan and Mycenaean religions, but also of the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. We will also come back to those similarities first noted in the artistic expression of the religions, so that we can trace the Minoan elements that do appear in Mycenaean religion, and try to understand why they were taken up by the Mycenaeans and what that adoptive behavior meant in terms of religious belief. Elements of other Aegean cultures will be explored as well as we move forward in time through the Iron Age and into the Archaic and Classical periods, in an effort to evaluate what came through from the Bronze Age into the historical periods practice of cult.",

An object-based learning course, this class will focus on the close study of Greek vases in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, and a number of class sessions will meet in the Museum. Several guest lecturers will discuss the conservation and ancient repair of Greek vases and the ceramic analysis of Greek pottery. We will also learn about the making of ceramics in a session in the Addams Hall pottery studio. Some background in art history or classical studies is helpful but not required.",

The seminar proposes to expand our discussion of landscape as a larger theme in the visual arts, with examples drawn from Europe, America, East Asia, and other locations. We will further consider how some sites became known as famous places, and how that act is tied up to issues of local, regional and national identity and often implicated in the promotion of specific places. This course will feature the opportunity to study works in the PMA collection, travel to \"famous sites\" around Philadelphia, and participate in the final preparations and installation of the exhibition.",

This course will survey the movement's major contexts and proponents--Manet, Monet, Morisot, Cezanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Rodin--from its origins in the 1860's to its demise in the 1890's, as well as its subsequent adaptions throughout the world until World War I. Particular attention is paid to the artists' critical reception and the historical conditions which allowed one nation, France, to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. The course also analyzes the effects of the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris, and its affects on artistic developments. We also look outside of France's borders to Germany and Britain.",

You will learn about major pre-colonial African cities in the sub-Saharan area, as well as about Western colonial city planning and traditional culture. Coming to terms with decolonization and contemporary Africa we will look at the built, unbuilt, and written work of architects, designers, and city planners, such as Rex Martienssen and Amancio Pancho Guedes. Particular attention will be given to the social and political role of traditional architecture in expressing and shaping ideas about the environment, technology, and identity. The theme will be explored in a series of lectures, readings, discussions, and assignments where architectural history, literature, and anthropology will be interwoven to provide the basis for further interdisciplinary forays into African architecture.",

The course will explore the ancient civilizations that created the Seven Wonders: Egypt (The Great Pyramids and the Lighthouse of Alexandria), Mesopotamia (the Hanging Gardens of Babylon), and Greece (the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia). In addition, the course will examine several ancient wonders that did not make the famous list. The additional wonders include the ziggurat of Ur, the labyrinthine palace of Minos at Knossos, the tomb of King Tutankhamen, the citadel of Homeric Troy, Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, and Darius the Great's royal center at Persepolis.",

We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors, and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome, further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. The nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters, we discuss the spaces of sanctuary and tomb, house and city, garden and private collection; visits to the Penn Museum.",

Photographic images have inspired countless paintings, appeared in combines and installations, morphed into sculptures, drawings and performances, and served both as the object and the vehicle of institutional critique. They are also an increasingly important exhibition site: where most of us go to see earthworks, happenings and body-art. This course is a three-part exploration of our photographic present.",

Topics to be discussed include the Arts and Crafts movement, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Art Deco, the International Style, and Post-modernism. The debate over the role of technology in modern life and art, the search for a universal language of architectural communication, and the insistent demand that architecture serve human society are themes that will be traced throughout the course. Among the important figures to be considered are Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Rovert Venturi, and Denise Scott Brown. The course includes weekly discussion sessions and several excursions to view architecture in Philadelphia.",

This period witnessed the rise of abstraction in painting and sculpture, as well as the inventions of collage, photomontage, constructed sculpture, the ready made and found object, and performance art. Encounters with the arts of Africa, Oceania and other traditions unfamiliar in the West spurred innovations in media, technique, and subject matter. Artists began to respond to the challenge of photography, to organize themselves into movements, and in some cases, to challenge the norms of art through \"anti-art.\" A new gallery system replaced traditional forms of exhibiting and selling art, and artists took on new roles as publicists, manifesto writers, and exhibition organizers. This course examines these developments, with attention to formal innovations as well as cultural and political contexts.",

We consider the work of such artists as Cimabue, Duccio, Giotto, and Mantegna as well as the careers, personalities and reception of Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian. With emphasis placed upon artists' cultivation of particular styles, we look closely at works originating from various contexts: political (city-states, princely courts, and the Papal States); spatial / topographic (inner chambers of private palaces, family chapels, church facades, and public squares); and geographic (Florence, Siena, Rome, Naples, Venice, and Milan). Topics include artistic creativity and license, religious devotion, the revival of antiquity, observation of nature, art as problem-solving, the public reception and function of artworks, debates about style, artistic rivalry, and traveling artists. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course selects works as paradigmatic case studies, and analyzes contemporary attitudes toward art of this period through study of primary sources.",

We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors, and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome, further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. The nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters, we discuss the spaces of sanctuary and tomb, house and city, garden and private collection; visits to the Penn Museum.",

Starting with Jacques-Louis David's revolutionary history paintings, we study Napoleonic representations of empire, Goya's imagery of violence, romantic representations of madness and desire, Friedrich's nationalist landscapes, as well as the politicized realism of Courbet. Some of the themes that are addressed include: the revolutionary hero, the birth of the public museum, the anxious masculinity of romanticism, the rise of industry and bourgeois culture, the beginnings of photography, the quest for national identity and, not least, the origins of the modernist painting. Throughout, we recover the original radicalism of art's formal and conceptual innovations at times of political and social crisis. We focus on the history of French painting, but include sculpture, photography, visual culture and the development of the modern city, in England, Germany and Spain.",

Discussions focus especially on several key themes: the aesthetic status of art and the theological role of images; the revival of classical models and visual modes; social rituals such as pilgrimage and crusading; the cult of the Virgin and the status of women in art; and, more generally, the ideology of visual culture across the political and urban landscapes.",

We will conclude with the transformation of several film industries into propaganda tools during World War II (including the Nazi, Soviet, and US film industries). In addition to contemporary theories that investigate the development of cinema and visual culture during the first half of the 20th century, we will read key texts that contributed to the emergence of film theory.

This foundation epic of Western literature tells of gods, heroes, and magical places already part of deep past when Homer's work was set to writing, ca. 700 B.C. Does the Homeric story of the Trojan War have a basis in real events? Scholars have long pointed to the Mycenaean civilization, which flourished on the mainland of Greece in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600-1200 B.C.), as the inspiration fo the Homeric stories. In this course, we will examine the archaeology of the great centers of the Late Bronze Age in Greece and Anatolia, particulary Mycenae, Pylos, and Troy. Our main aim will be to better understand the social, political, and economic context of this Late Bronze Age world, which may shed light on the possibility that a \"Trojan War\" of some kind actually occurred. The primary focus on archaeology is supplemented by readings from Homer's Illiad and Odyssey.",

It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the \"canon\" of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe, but is becoming increasingly global.

We also investigate the ways that these creations have subsequently helped to launch new visual entertainments, including museum spectacles, blackface minstrelsy, and early film, from the colonial period through the 1940s.",

Topics to be explored may include: theories of stone in the Renaissance, the environmental implications of excavation, the materials and materiality of earth and soil, stonecutting and mining, the aesthetic problem of weight, architecture on bodies of water, and the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and other geological disasters. Guests to the seminar from the University of Paris-IV and the University of Zurich will offer opportunities for students to discuss and present their ideas to extramural audiences.

With emphasis placed upon artists cultivation of particular styles, we look closely at works originating from various contexts: political (city-states, princely courts, and the Papal States); spatial / topographic (inner chambers of private palaces, family chapels, church facades, and public squares); and geographic (Florence, Siena, Rome, Naples, Venice, and Milan). Topics include artistic creativity and license, religious devotion, the revival of antiquity, observation of nature, art as problem-solving, the public reception and function of artworks, debates about style, artistic rivalry, and traveling artists. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course selects works as paradigmatic case studies, and analyze contemporary attitudes toward art of this period through study of primary sources.",

Stretching from the American and French Revolutions to the eve of World War I, topics to be covered include: the rise of capitalist and industrialist culture, art and revolutionary upheaval, global travel and empire, the origins of modernist art and architecture, and new media such as stereoscopes, iron and glass construction, and photography. Major artistic personalities of the age, from Jacques-Louis David and Gustave Courbet to Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh, and from Friedrich Schinkel and, Baron Haussmann to Frank Furness and Frank Lloyd Wright, are discussed.

This period encompasses the history of both early and modern art in the U.S., from its first appearances to its rise to prominence and institutionalization. While tracking this history, the course examines art's relation to historical processes of modernization (industrialization, the development of transportation and communications, the spread of corporate organization in business, urbanization, technological development, the rise of mass media and mass markets, etc.) and to the economic polarization, social fragmentation, political conflict, and the cultural changes these developments entailed. In these circumstances, art is drawn simultaneously toward truth and fraud, realism and artifice, science and spirituality, commodification and ephemerality, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, individualism and collectivity, the past and the future, professionalization and popularity, celebrating modern life and criticizing it.",

We also investigate the ways that these creations have subsequently helped to launch new visual entertainments, including museum spectacles, blackface minstrelsy, and early film, from the colonial period through the 1940s.",

This period encompasses the history of both early and modern art in the U.S., from its first appearances to its rise to prominence and institutionalization. While tracking this history, the course examines art's relation to historical processes of modernization (industrialization, the development of transportation and communications, the spread of corporate organization in business, urbanization, technological development, the rise of mass media and mass markets, etc.) and to the economic polarization, social fragmentation, political conflict, and the cultural changes these developments entailed. In these circumstances, art is drawn simultaneously toward truth and fraud, realism and artifice, science and spirituality, commodification and ephemerality, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, individualism and collectivity, the past and the future, professionalization and popularity, celebrating modern life and criticizing it.",

You will learn about major pre-colonial African cities in the sub-Saharan area, as well as about Western colonial city planning and traditional culture. Coming to terms with decolonization and contemporary Africa we will look at the built, unbuilt, and written work of architects, designers, and city planners, such as Rex Martienssen and Amancio Pancho Guedes. Particular attention will be given to the social and political role of traditional architecture in expressing and shaping ideas about the environment, technology, and identity. The theme will be explored in a series of lectures, readings, discussions, and assignments where architectural history, literature, and anthropology will be interwoven to provide the basis for further interdisciplinary forays into African architecture.",

    "course_description" : "Topics Varies. Spring 2015: In 313 when Constantine the Great inaugurated a Christian empire, Roman visual culture was many centuries old, and some foundational elements of Late Antique art already established. Between ca. 200 and 700 CE Greco-Roman art was transformed, to create the Medieval, Byzantine and Islamic visual traditions. From Trier and Ravenna to Antioch and Aphrodisias, rulers and subjects, elites and ordinary people, and even foreign conquerors cared to maintain Roman civilization. That Roman cultural legacy included both a drive towards innovation and a passion for maintaining tradition (we will contest narratives of Late Antique art's 'decline'); meanwhile, from the 3rd c. onwards, Christianity challenged and changed many roles of Roman images. This proseminar's interdisciplinary approach ranges the broadest possible range of media and contexts for the decoration of sacred, Imperial, domestic, funerary and civic space with old and new forms and styles of artifacts and images. We also look, in translation, at the rich corpus of Late Antique texts about art and viewership. Open to advanced undergraduates by permission of the instructor.",

In this course, we will examine the development of Greek vase-painting from the 10th to the 5th century BC, with particular emphasis on the pottery of the Archaic and Classical periods that was produced in the cities of Athens and Corinth. An object-based learning course, this class will focus on the close study of Greek vases in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, and a number of class sessions will meet in the Museum. Several guest lecturers will discuss the conservation and ancient repair of Greek vases and the ceramic analysis of Greek pottery. We will also learn about the making of ceramics in a session in the Addams Hall pottery studio. Some background in art history or classical studies is helpful but not required.",

The confrontations between modernity and tradition, state and self, the colonizer and the colonized, and collecting and the market are among its themes. The course begins with a study of the way modern art was defined at the turn of the 20th century, the promotion of oil painting and the call to preserve national styles, and the use of art at world's fairs. The avant-garde pursuit of individuality, state-sponsored modernism, the use of art as propaganda in WWII and Communist Revolution, and the place of Chinese, Korean and Japanese art in the contemporary market are also topics covered in this course.",

This foundation epic of Western literature tells of gods, heroes, and magical places already part of deep past when Homer's work was set to writing, ca. 700 B.C. Does the Homeric story of the Trojan War have a basis in real events? Scholars have long pointed to the Mycenaean civilization, which flourished on the mainland of Greece in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600-1200 B.C.), as the inspiration for the Homeric stories. In this course, we examine the archaeology of the great centers of the Late Bronze Age in Greece and Anatolia, particularly Mycenae, Pylos, and Troy. Our main aim is to better understand the social, political, and economic context of this Late Bronze Age world, which may shed light on the possibility that a \"Trojan War\" of some kind actually occurred. The primary focus on archaeology is supplemented by readings from Homer's Illiad and Odyssey.",

Beginning with the cinematic revolution signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism (of Rossellini and De Sica), we will follow the evolution of postwar cinema through the French New Wave (of Godard, Resnais, and Varda), American movies of the 1950s and 1960s (including the New Hollywood cinema of Coppola and Scorsese), and the various other new wave movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (such as the New German Cinema). We will then selectively examine some of the most important films of the last two decades, including those of U.S. independent film movement and movies from Iran, China, and elsewhere in an expanding global cinema culture. There will be precise attention paid to formal and stylistic techniques in editing, mise-en-scene, and sound, as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of film.",

    "course_description" : "Early twentieth-century art in Europe is marked by a number of exciting transformations. This period witnessed the rise of abstraction in painting and sculpture, as well as the inventions of collage, photomontage, constructed sculpture, the ready made and found object, and performance art. Encounters with the arts of Africa, Oceania and other traditions unfamiliar in the West spurred innovations in media, technique, and subject matter. Artists began to respond to the challenge of photography, to organize themselves into movements, and in some cases, to challenge the norms of art through \"anti-art.\" A new gallery system replaced traditional forms of exhibiting and selling art, and artists took on new roles as publicists, manifesto writers, and exhibition organizers. This course examines these developments, with attention to formal innovations as well as cultural and political contexts. This course requires permission from the instructor.",

Modernism Across Borders will take advantage of this commonality among diverse sites of inquiry, treating modernism as a transborder phenomenon while also probing the limitations and still-latent potential of such an approach. This experimental, interdisciplinary seminar will devote the first two hours of each three-hour class to discussion of readings in the study of modernism. The third hour will be devoted to a presentation and discussion of a work in progress a project either of a member of the course, or of a guest. Seminar discussions will be led by a number of Penn faculty. Conveners of the overall course are Christine Poggi and Kevin M. F. Platt. Students are encouraged to bring work in progress, either on the basis of past seminars or independent projects, to form the basis for their projects in this seminar.",

Spring 2015: Despite the fact that one exhibition on Impressionism chases the next these days, the academic study of this crucial early modernist movement has slowed since the 1970s and 1980s, when new art historical paradigms (like feminism and the social history of art) were tested on Manet, Monet and their followers. This seminar seeks to understand this development but also countermand it by establishing an account of Impressionism that fits our current global, multimedia and multidisciplinary forms of humanistic thought. To this end, we will read those recent scholars who place Impressionism within new contexts that include the history of science and technology (visual perception, psychology, evolution, chemistry), political history and theory (republicanism, revolution, empire, nationalism), and consumer culture (fashion, capitalism). We will also go back to the movement s early critics (like Laforgue and Geffroy), in order to appreciate their strange metaphoric languages (which saw in Impressionism, for instance, the seeds of social upheaval or the most advanced eye in human evolution ) and make them newly useful for a 21st-century interpretation of Impressionism s true intellectual heft and radical aesthetics.",

Spring 2015: This course is about pictorial photography: large-format analogue and digital images that look scenic or staged, require a prolonged and attentive viewing, and are destined for the wall of a museum. Until quite recently, most of us associated this kind of photography with the 70s, 80s and early 90s, i.e., with poststructuralist theory and the aesthetics of postmodernism. It seemed a perfect illustration of the axiom that a photograph is only a representation or, better yet, a representation of a representation, since everything is a cultural construction. But not only has pictorial photography continued unabated, it has gained more and more momentum. It has also proven resistant to all of our attempts to de-realize it to treat it as a tool, a commodity, a fiction or any other kind of human artifact. Pictorial photography is an important chapter within a larger narrative one that began with the first pinhole camera, and will end only when we do. Since this chapter begins with Pictorialism and Camera Work, that is also where we will start, but most of the seminar will be devoted to contemporary practitioners.",
