    "course_description" : "In the last 25 years there as has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object, which cannot be obtained directly. The data that is accessible is typically some collection of weighted averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT). In this contest we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis, the Fourier transform, interpolation and approximation of functions, sampling theory, digital filtering and noise analysis.",

The first unit will be an introduction to variational principles of mechanics and calculus of variations, and will apply these concepts to injury problems (e.g., occupant kinematics during a collision, vehicle kinematics, impact to padded surfaces). Special emphasis will be placed on converting a system input into a body response. The second unit of the course will be used to discuss the effect of gross body motion on tissue and organ mechanical response. Material models of biological tissue will be discussed, and examples relating body motion to tissue response will be reviewed. In the final unit of this course, students are required to research and review a problem of their choice and present a report detailing an engineering based solution to the problem.",

Topics will range from, but are not limited to, protein folding/forced unfolding to biomolecule associations, cell and membrane mechanics, and cell motility, drawing from very recent examples in the literature. Frequent hands-on exposure to modern methods in the field will be a significant element of the course in the laboratory.

The course will be based upon twic weekly lectures and \"hands-on\" weekly assignments that teach basic signal recording, feature extraction, classification and practical implementation in clinical systems. Assignments will build incrementally toward constructing a complete, functional BMI system. Fundamental concepts in neurosignals, hardware and software will be reinforced by practical examples and in-depth study. Guest lecturers and demonstrations will supplement regular lectures.",
