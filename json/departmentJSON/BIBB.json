Why do girls and boys develop sexually at different ages? The role of ecology and social life in shaping human mating patterns will be evaluated through the use of ethnographies and cross-cultural materials on a variety of human cultures. Does everybody have sex the way we do? Why marry? Are there biological bases for love? Why do we experience jealousy? Fianlly, topics relevant to human sexuality today will be discussed, such as recreational sex, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases. Examples are drawn primarily from traditional and modern human societies; data from studies of nonhuman primates are also considered.",

The mechanisms by which the ANS regulates peripheral tissues will be discussed, including reflex and regulatory functions, as will the effect of drugs which modulate ANS activity. The role of the ANS in regulating behavior will be addressed in the context of thirst, salt appetite and food intake.",

We will cover the neurobiological changes specific to the brains of autistic children such as in the cerebral cortex white matter amygdala, brainstem, cerebellum and neural communication systems. We will also focus on genes associated with autism, many of which regulate neuronal communication systems. Additionally covered are some of the more popularized issues such as autistic savants, vaccines and mirror neurons.

The introduction to this course will include a brief review of physiology and neuronal communication, and will continue with discussions of evolution and behavioral neuroscience methodology using comparative and translational approaches. The remainder of the course will involve a more detailed analysis of specific behaviors and an evaluation of empirical research in each topic (historically through present day) with a focus on the underlying neural circuitry involved in the control of these behaviors.
