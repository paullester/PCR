This course examines language as an instrument to send and receive information. In part I, we will start with a computational approach to the problem of how an information agent would extract and use information from language. That is, we will take language to be an encoding of a mental content. The course considers some of the classic position papers on artificial intelligence and then moves on to develop a compositional account of computing meanings based on categorial grammar. We will, in addition, discuss some of the leading ideas in the theory of artificial neural nets and concept formation, particularly prototype theory. In part II, we will focus on compositional theories of meaning; we will pay particular attention to categorial grammar, developing a strictly compositional theory of the encoding. In this section, we will develop some ideas from dynamic semantics and pragmatic theories of presupposition and implicature. In part III, we will explore reasons for supposing that meaning is largely social and not purely a question of mental content. This will lead us to a critical consideration of linguistic relativity, the idea that language can influence thought.",

We will examine the question of how children acquire extremely complex linguistic systems without explicit instruction, drawing on psychological work on the language abilities of children.

In still other cases, the nature and structure of language has been radically altered. The course introduces the basics of linguistic structure through a discussion of which aspects of language have proved to be relatively stable, and which are readily altered, under conditions of bilingualism.",

In this course, we will look at how language and other signaling systems are used in populations and how conventions and usage patterns arise over time. Game theoretic pragmatics has introduced the idea that communication in- volves strategic reasoning. Among the goals of this move are to connect language to communication systems in general and to show how language solves some of the particular problems presented by communication. Lan- guage has a number of interesting properties including the use of politeness and deception. Politness involves the use of additional effort by a subordinate individual in a relationship that involves potential power asymmetries. This seems to violate the Zahavi Handicap Principle which requires that honest signaling be costly. Deception goes against a general preference for truthful- ness in cases where there is a partial or complete divergence of interest on the part of the speaker and hearer. Why doesn t language simply break down under these pressures? To understand these issues, we ll look at the social evolution of signaling games and, where possible, place them in the context primate behavior.",

The topics covered include Perception, Action, Learning, Language, Knowledge Representation, and Inference, and the relations and interactions between such modules. The course shows how the different views from the parent disciplines interact, and identifies some common themes among the theories that have been proposed. The course pays particular attention to the distinctive role of computation in such theories, and provides an introduction to some of the main directions of current research in the field.",

    "course_description" : "Most of the languages now spoken in Europe, along with some languages of Iran, India and central Asia, are thought to be descended from a single language known as Proto-Indo-European, spoken at least six thousand years ago, probably in a region extending from north of the Black Sea in modern Ukraine east through southern Russia. Speakers of Proto-Indo-European eventually populated Europe in the Bronze Age, and their societies formed the basis of the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, as well as of the Celtic, Germanic and Slavic speaking peoples. What were the Proto-Indo-Europeans like? What did they believe about the world and their gods? How do we know? Reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language, one of the triumphs of comparative and historical linguistics in the 19th and 20th centuries, allows us a glimpse into the society of this prehistoric people. In this seminar students will, through comparison of modern and ancient languages, learn the basis of this reconstruction -- the comparative method of historical linguistics -- as well as explore the culture and society of the Proto-Indo-Europeans and their immediate descendants. In addition, we will examine the pseudo-scientific basis of the myth of Aryan supremacy, and study the contributions of archaeological findings in determining the \"homeland\" of the Indo-Europeans. No prior knowledge of any particular language is necessary. This seminar should be of interest to students considering a major in linguistics, anthropology and archaeology, ancient history or comparative religion. (Also fulfills Cross-Cultural Analysis.)",

We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and, where appropriate, develop connections with parsing theory, automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting, we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning, theorem proving, dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I). It includes a review of the propositional and predicate calculus before introducing tableaux and resolution systems, unification, axiomatic systems, natural deduction and sequent calculi. The latter two systems are particularly relevant for grammar formalisms like phrase structure grammars, TAGs and Categorial Grammar.",

Indeed, if humans themselves can be said to stand out among other species on Earth, it may well be language that played the crucial role in getting us here. So where does language come from? This question has been dubbed the hardest problem in science , but the last three decades have seen a notable renaissance in scientific attempts to answer it. This seminar will examine both the results of this multidisciplinary endeavor and the tools that have been employed in it. It will involve discussions of the nature of language and its place among other communication systems and will touch on fundamental questions of what it means to be human.",

In keeping with the comparative perspective of linguistic theory, parallels and differences between ASL and other (primarily spoken) languages are pointed out where appropriate. Historical and sociolinguistic issues are addressed where they are relevant to elucidating linguistic structure. Though the course focuses on ASL, it necessarily touches on issues concerning sign languages more generally, notably the possible effects of modality (sign vs. speech) on linguistic structure and the implications of the signed modality for general linguistics. Although the course does not presuppose knowledge of ASL, it does require acquaintance with basic concepts of linguistics.",

Topics include a selection of issues on the semantics-pragmatics interface, such as conversational implicatures, presuppositions, reference resolution and perspective taking, and quantifier scope. Students will carry out a class project, possibly in groups, to develop (and, if possible, carry out) an experimental study of meaning-related phenomena of their own. Relevant tools for experimental design and the implementation of such studies will be introduced along the way. This provides students with the opportunity to engage in a scientific investigation of their own early on in their undergraduate career in a domain that is easily accessible and yet central to the general enterprise of the cognitive sciences.",

Additionally, drawing from the required Linguistics and other ASL/Deaf Studies coursework, students will develop an inquiry question and conduct preliminary community-based research to analyze sociolinguistic variations of ASL and Deaf cultural attitudes, behaviors, and norms. Ongoing reflections and discussions-formal and informal-on Deaf cultural/theoretical topics drawing from readings as well as community experiences will be integral to the course experience.

Beginning in the modern period, when the very status of Irish as a living language has been hotly debated, the course will look backwards at the Celtic cultural revival of the late 19th century, the impact of the famine, nationalism, colonialism, the arrival of Christianity and the Roman alphabet, and the position of Irish within the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family. Term papers may be based on fieldwork in the Irish-American community, or research. Audio and visual resources will supplement the lectures. Knowledge of Irish Gaelic is not required.",
