We envision a course in which there would be a 2-week introduction to orthographic peculiarities, and then a different instructor from among the star-studded cast at CAJS each week, introducing the students to reading texts in the instructors' respective specialties. This is an unrepeatable opportunity for our graduate students to learn to read Judaeo-Arabic, and also to survey the entirety of the field, from Arabic Bible translation to Geniza documents, in a way that would otherwise be impossible, except perhaps at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It would expand their horizons, enable them to do comparative work, and also enhance their attractiveness as scholars and teachers to prospective employers.",

Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depend upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts. With a diverse group of readings--autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthrology, and literary theory--this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture. What does it mean to translate? How do we read a text in translation? What does it mean to live between two languages? Who is a translator? What are different kinds of literary and cultural translation? what are their principles and theories? Their assumptions and practices? Their effects on and implications for the individual and the society?",

How have Islam, Judaism, and Christianity influenced each other in these regions historically? How have Jews, Christians, and Muslims fared as religious minorities? To what extent have communal relations been characterized by harmony and cooperation, or by strife and discord, and how have these relations changed in different contexts over time? To what extent and under what circumstances have members of these communities converted, intermarried, formed business alliances, and adopted or developed similar customs? How has the emergence of the modern nation-state system affected communal relations as well as the legal or social status of religious minorities in particular countries? How important has religion been as one variable in social identity (along with sect, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.), and to what extent has religious identity figured into regional conflicts and wars? The focus of the class will be on the modern period (c. 1800-present) although we will read about some relevant trends in the early and middle Islamic periods as well. Students will also pursue individually tailored research to produce final papers. Prior background in Islamic studies and Middle Eastern history is required.",

At the same time, research has also focused on the rupture of narrative, the inability to find appropriate forms of telling, and the experience of a loss of words. The notion of trauma (Greek for \"wound\") may stand for such a rupture. Many kinds of narratives, most prominently the recollections of Holocaust survivors, are instances in which memories are invoked not only to come to terms with traumatic events, but also to inscribe trauma in various ways. In this seminar, we will read theoretical work on memory and trauma, discuss their implication for the study of literature, art, and culture, read select examples from Holocaust survivors' autobiographies (i.e. Primo Levi, EliWiesel), and discuss visual art (i.e. Boltanski, Kiefer) and film (i.e. Resnais, Lanzmann, Spielberg).",

    "course_description" : "In late antiquity, both in Israel and in Babylonia, the custom developed of accompanying the Bible reading in synagogues with simultaneous oral translation (targum) into the Aramaic spoken language of the day. The translators negotiated their way between literal translation and various degrees of interpretive translation based on the different styles and idioms of Hebrew and Aramaic and considerations of theology, law, and other matters. Those targums popular in the land of Israel expanded the text considerably by introducing aggadic lore in the translation. They were studied by the laity, exerted a strong influence on the medieval Bible commentators and are still regularly studied in some Jewish circles today. They constitute a valuable resource for the study of the Hebrew Bible and for understanding Jewish belief, practice, and folklore. Since the Renaissance they have also been studied by Christian scholars as an aid to understanding Scripture and as a window on Jewish belief contemporary with the early development of Christianity. The translators' methods, especially as explained by S.D. Luzzatto (Shadal) in the 19th century, are a virtual encyclopedia of the philosophy and techniques of translation. The course will begin with a brief orientation in the grammar of the targums to enable students to recognize the main differences between Hebrew and Aramaic. The main focus will be on studying and comparing selected narrative, poetic and legal passages and analyzing thei interpretive emphases, their religious ideas, and their methods of translation.",

    "course_description" : "Christianity and Judaism are often called \"Biblical religions\" because they are believed to be founded upon the Bible. But the truth of the matter is that it was less the Bible itself than the particular ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Christians and Jews that shaped the development of these two religions and that also marked the difference between them. So, too, ancient Biblical interpretation --Jewish and Christian-- laid the groundwork for and developed virtually all the techniques and methods that have dominated literary criticism and hermeneutics (the science of interpretation) since then. The purpose of this course is to study some of the more important ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Jews and Christians before the modern period, and particularly in the first six centuries in the common era. We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom, Kermode, Derrida, Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods. All readings are in English translation, and will include selections from Philo of Alexandria, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic midrash, the New Testament and early Church Fathers, Gnostic writings, Origen, and Augustine. No previous familiarity with Biblical scholarship is required although some familiarity with the Bible itself would be helpful.",

How (and when) did beliefs surrounding Jesus depart meaningfully from Jewish ideas about the messiah? How do Rabbinic Jewish traditions about the messiah and messianic age differ from their Christian counterparts, and is there evidence of any \"influence\"?

We will discuss literary works that reflect Israelis' struggle with their national identity, from the patriotic 1948 generation for whom self and country overlapped to contemporary writers who ask what it means to be Israeli. While Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem \"I want to die in my bed\" was a manifesto for individualism, the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict returned writers to the national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980's. Readings include poems by Natan Alterman, Amir Gilboa, Meir Wieseltier and Roni Somek as well as ficition by Amos Oz, David Grossman, Sayed Kashua, Alona Kimhi and Etgar Keret. Texts, discussions and papers in Hebrew. The content of This course changes from year to year so students may take it for credit more than once.",

In some cases, the specific topic may also be the work of a specific author, like Maimonides. Primary sources will be read in their original Hebrew.

    "course_description" : "This course is designed as a first course in Hebrew and Israeli literatures in their original forms: no re-written or reworked texts will be presented. It aims to introduce major literary works, genres and figures. Texts and discussions will be in Hebrew. Depending on the semester's focus, fiction, poetry or other forms of expression will be discussed. Personal, social, and political issues that find expression in the culture will also be examined. This course is meant to provide methods for literary interpretation through close reading of these texts, and thus falls under the umbrella of the College's \"Literatures of the World\" course. Past topics include: \"Poem, Song, Nation;\" \"Israeli Drama,\" \"The Israeli Short Story;\" \"Postmodernist Israeli Writing;\" and \"Literature and Identity in Israel.\" Fall 2013 topic: INTRODUCTION TO MODERN HEBREW LITERATURE: ISRAELI SHORT STORY This course concentrates on contemporary Israeli short stories, post-modernist as well as traditional, written by male and female authors. The diction is simple, often colloquial, but the stories reflect an exciting inner world and a stormy outer reality. For Hebrew writers, the short story has been a favorite genre since the Renaissance of Hebrew literature in the 19th century until now, when Hebrew literature is vibrant in a country where Hebrew is spoken. The lion share of the course focuses on authors who emerged in the last 25 years like Orly Kastel-Bloom, Alex Epstein, Almog Bahar. Student level and literary taste will influence the choice of works. Class conducted in Hebrew. Texts read in the original language. There will be 3-4 short papers and a final exam.",

    "course_description" : "Our perception of Jewish women around 1800 is shaped by the social and intellectual adventures of Jewish Salonieres and recently re-discovered female writers. The glamorous lives of the romantic writer Dorothea Mendelssohn/Veit/Schlegel and the \"German Wollstonecraft\" Esther Gad/Bernard/Domeier, the Salonieres Rahel Levin/Varnhagen and Henriette de Lemos/Herz, who were instrumental in spreading Goethe's fame and literature, overshadow the existence of most Jewish women of that period. While the aforementioned women sought realizing their self and their ambitions in gentile society, others asked to fulfill their objectives and aspirations within the framework and language of traditional Judaism. The latter group was encouraged to embark on this journey by the speedy religious and socio-political transformation process that changed the life and habits of central European Jewry since the last quarter of the eighteenth century. These transformation processes caused significant changes in the female role model. Whereas traditional Judaism has marginalized women religiously, the structure of bourgeois family placed women in the center of religious performance. In their new role as housewife and mother, women were held responsible for the religious education of their children (male and female) and thus guaranteed the transmission of Judaism to future generations. In preparation for this role, they draw upon the rich literature of text and prayer books for women that were increasingly published in German language. This course aims at capturing the lives of women in Central Europe on the threshold of modernity, between the mid eighteenth and the mid nineteenth century. Starting from different fole models that Jewish society/societies ascribed to women during this period, we will discuss possibilities and limitation of female self-realization. The actual and written biographies of Jewish women will therefore be contrasted with authoritative texts of traditional, enlightened and bourgeois Jewish society, respectively.",

This is an unrepeatable opportunity for our graduate students to learn to read Judaeo-Arabic, and also to survey the entirety of the field, from Arabic Bible translation to Geniza documents, in a way that would otherwise be impossible, except perhaps at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The 1955 anti-war poem by Yehuda Amichai \"I Want to Die in My Bed\" led a generations rebellion against glorifying nationalism and sacrifice. Other writers like Amos Oz, A.B. Yehoshua and Natan Zach fought for individual expression over the collective cause. Now considered the pillars of Hebrew literature, their lives are the subject of numerous documentaries and their works have been adapted into films.

Grading is based primarily on students' literary understanding. There will be four 2-page written assignments over the course of the semester. We will discuss literary works that reflect Israelis' struggle with their national identity, from the patriotic 1948 generation for whom self and country overlapped to contemporary writers who ask what it means to be Israeli. While Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem \"I want to die in my bed\" was a manifesto for individualism, the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict returned writers to the national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980's. Readings include poems by Natan Alterman, Amir Gilboa, Meir Wieseltier and Roni Somek as well as ficition by Amos Oz, David Grossman, Sayed Kashua, Alona Kimhi and Etgar Keret. Texts, discussions and papers in Hebrew. The content of This course changes from year to year so students may take it for credit more than once.",
