The principles, tests, and interventions in positive psychology are being applied in a growing number of arenas, including: education, coaching, corporate and organizational leadership, health, sports, disabilities, and clinical psychology and psychiatry. Students will learn about this range of applications, selecting or creating interventions to carry out and assess in vivo. Rigorous methodologies, such as random assignment placebo controlled designs, that separate inert interventions from active ingredients will be emphasized. This will begin to prepare students for the major application within their specialty they will carry out in the second half of their Master' program.",
