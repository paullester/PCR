The course continues the work of Introduction to Directing, focusing on effective text analysis, communicating with actors, and use of theatrical space and movement to tell the story of the play. The course is structured as a workshop, with students presenting and discussing each other's scene work in class. Students are responsible for three large projects, and each project is presented and discussed twice, first in its workshop and then in its final stage of development. The final project involves minimally staging a one-act play for an audience. Course work is supplemented by readings on the work of major modern directors, and by viewing and writing critiques of selected theatre performances.",

The course also explores how these visual and auditory elements might be used by actors, directors, and designers to enhance and enrich our more traditional, text-based theatre.",

The plays of ancient Greece and Elizabethan England were written and performed only by men, beginning a long tradition of theatre that represented women only from male perspectives. Has that tradition been so dominant for so long that women's voices on stage are still a novelty? This course focuses on a wide range of plays and performances by and about women; the work we read (and view) will evidence artistic attempts to represent women's lives, experiences and perspectives on the stage. Among the issues encountered and examined in these works are the roles of love, sexuality, friendship, career, community, marriage, motherhood, family, and feminism in women's lives - as well as the economic and political position(s) of women in society. The course will also offer contextual background on feminist theatre history, theory, and literature, as well as the diverse (and divergent) creative efforts of female artists to use use live performance as a means of creating social and political change.",

They will learn how to support their voice in a healthy way, with a view to longevity, spontaneity and flexibility of use. In this course, these kinds of vocal exercises will be applied to short, character monologues, in order to foster sensitivity to our voices and breath and to the habits and tensions we have formed around speaking in public. For an actor, reconnecting with their authentic voice is essential for an honest, connected and compelling performance. This training is also useful for anyone who wants to speak in public with confidence, sincerity and ease.",

The course will outline the theoretical and philosophical foundations of this work and the political controversies it has ignited. Special focus will be on the engagement of this work with public space and contemporary urban life. Course requirements include wide reading and class discussion, and oral presentations on artists, collectives, and movements that have significantly shaped the current landscape. The course includes a laboratory component in which students will have the opportunity to construct a performance art or installation piece in campus public space. This public art piece will serve as site research for a final paper. All students welcome. No previous experience or special expertise in the field required. Just genuine interest or curiosity.",

Finally, it is precisely because the musical is a popular theatrical form that we can discuss changing public tastes, and the financial pressures inherent in mounting a production. Beginning with early roots in operetta, we will survey the works of prominent writers in the American musical theatre, including Kern, Berlin, Gershwin, Porter, Rodgers, Hart, Hammerstein, Bernstein, Sondheim and others.

This course strongly stresses a commitment to actor work and responsibility to one's fellow actors. Practical work is supplemented by readings from Stanislavksy and a variety of other acting theorists that may include Uta Hagen, Robert Cohen, Stella Adler, among others.

    "course_description" : "Design for theatre (and all of the performing arts) is a dynamic, collaborative process that engages both intellect and emotion in staging the dramatic moment. The personal vision of the designer must navigate the often-uncharted waters of the production process, from the earliest, personal moments of design inspiration to the opening night performance. Design flows from creativity, is structured by research and theory, and is realized in living form by collaboration in the dynamic process of theatre-making. This class will integrate history, theory and practice of stage design in the interactive setting of the Collaborative Classroom in Van Pelt Library in this special interdisciplinary, active-learning course offering open to all Penn students. Group and individual projects, field visits, practical projects and guest speakers will be featured in this newly-revised course.",

Topics include: what light is, what it does, and how light influences our perception and understanding of what we see. Exercises will help the student learn how to see and to understand how light shapes and affects the appearance people and objects on stage and in everyday life.

Examples might include: Method acting traditions and the performances of actors such as Marlon Brando and Geraldine Page in the plays (and films) of Tennessee Williams; and Shakespearean acting as performed by legends like Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud. We will compare British and American acting traditions, and will consider the different acting styles associated with particular historical periods and theatrical genres. Readings will include actor interviews, reviews, biographies, and selected scripts; viewing will include representative moments of brilliant acting on film, as well as live performances on the London stage. We will also plan to converse with actors we see, through class visits or attendance at talk-backs.",
