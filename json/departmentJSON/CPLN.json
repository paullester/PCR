This course examines the development of immigrant and receiving communities in the United States. It surveys public policy and community and economic development practices related to migration at the local, regional, national, and trans-national scale. Class readings, discussions, and visits to Philadelphia's immigrant neighborhoods explore themes including labor markets, housing experiences, political mobilization, civil society, cultural preservation, and the built environment. The first half of the course surveys migration and community formation among a broad range of ethnic groups in different parts of the city and suburbs, mainly through history, sociology, and geography; the second half focuses on specific policy and community and economic development initiatives. Ultimately, the class aims to provide students with 1) a broad knowledge of immigration and its impacts on cities and regions; 2) an in-depth understanding of urban policies and institutions working on immigration in U.S. cities; and 3) familiarity with community and economic development strategies for migrant and receiving communities.",

In part two, they develop a working understanding of economic development finance, completing exercises on tax increment finance, tax-credit financed development and \"double bottom line\" lending and equity investment.

Policy outcomes often have formal and/or scalar qualities. Yet policy developers often treat these as unintended consequences. And designers typically operate within the constraints created by such consequences. But could design thinking improve policy outcomes? Our test bed for this examination will be the relationship between energy and urban form, which presents a critical policy challenge for young professionals from many fields. The seminar will survey current research and policy options emerging from local, regional, state, and federal governments and discuss their implications for design outcomes at the scale of buildings, neighborhoods, and regions? None of these implications have been fully explored by policy makers at any level of government. This seminar will explore each in turn, allowing students to develop a deep understanding of the policy content on this important issue as well as of the policy process in general. Students will develop projects ranging from an analysis of policy to a presentation of the design implications of existing/proposed/alternative energy policies. The intent is for the seminar to make an active contribution",

We will start by looking at basic approaches to interpersonal negotiation and then move to considering contemporary approaches to understanding and addressing public disputes using negotiation, facilitation and public involvement. Design professionals - architects, construction managers, planners and others - face a variety of kinds of problems and challenges in their work. Some problems and challenges, whether simple or complex, are amenable to technical solutions based solely on the expertise of planners, managers, architects and others. There are, however, other problems and challenges that require adaptive work, primarily because technical expertise alone is insufficient to address the problems or challenges being faced. In this course, we'll focus on perspectives and methods for working through those later sorts of problems and challenges. Meets methods breadth requirement.",

We will look at this presence in the context of six regimes that have sought to claim this idea: colonialism, urbanism, regionalism, developmentalism, environmentalism and nomadism. Each provides us with a heritage of words loaded with facts and meanings such as territory, city, system, region, culture, need, progress, nature, wilderness and commons; each also provides us with an array of representational means, planning tactics, and design tools. The class will meet each week for three hours. The first hour will be a presentation by the instructor on a philosophical disposition, historical event, or cultural lens. This will be followed by a discussion on the readings. The last hour will be spent on the development of student projects researching culturally specific ideas of how urban and environmental regimes shape planning and design agendas.",

Psychology has disrupted our understanding of such decision behavior by parsing the distinctions between \"thinking fast and slow\" and the impact on larger systems. Planners know the challenges of \"unintended consequences\" and \"wicked problems\". Landscape architects embrace the inter-connectedness across an ecosystem \"transect\". And architects follow \"emergent\" solutions generated by \"lateral thinking\" across system boundaries.",
