This course will focus on the molecular mechanisms by which environmental exposures lead to end-organ injury and to diseases of environmental etiology (neurodegenerative and lung diseases, reproduction disruption and cardiovascular injury). Students will learn the difficulties in modeling response to low-dose chronic exposures, how these exposures are influenced by metabolism and disposition, and how reactive intermediates alter the function of biomolecules. Mechanisms responsible for cellular damage, aberrant repair, and end-organ injury will be discussed. Students will learn about modern predictive molecular toxicology to classify toxicants, predict individual susceptibility and response to environmental triggers, and how to develop and validate biomarkers for diseases of environmental etiology. Students are expected to write a term paper on risk assessment on an environmental exposure using available TOXNET information.",

The faculty will present overviews of current and emerging topics in cancer pharmacology. Emphasis of the presentations will be on the translation of basic science discoveries into therapeutic agents. Students will choose related topics to explore in more detail. In consultation with Dr. Blair, students will prepare a 45-minute presentation (using Power Point slides). Each student will give at least two presentations during the semester. The faculty teaching the course will be available for help with the presentations. The written assignment will involve a 10-page double spaced paper (exclusive of references) with a maximum of 25 references. The assignment will consist of a literature review in the area of one of the presentation topics chosen by the student.

The course will be directed and taught by Miriam Wattenbarger (CBE) and Vladimir Muzykantov (PHRM). Lectures will also be given by other faculty from the Penn School of of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of Medicine. The four main topics for the course are traditional drug delivery, drug delivery systems and nanocarriers, targeted and smart drug delivery systems, and translational aspects of drug delivery systems. There will be a midterm, final, and a group project for the course. Students will form small groups for the project and research a drug delivery topic to propose an extension of a current research area. An oral and written proposal will be given by each group to the class at the end of the semester. The course is open to SEAS seniors and graduate students, SAS college pre-med, pre-BE and pre-BGS seniors, biotechnology MS students, PGG and BGS graduate students, Wharton and Dental School students.",
