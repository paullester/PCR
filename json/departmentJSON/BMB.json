The course is open to ALL BGS graduate students currently taking or who have completed BIOM 600 (with course directors permission). Grading will be based on student presentations and participation in discussion.",

In this course we will take an in-depth look at general concepts common to many RNA binding proteins, the methods used to study protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions, and how the complex nature of large RNPs uniquely allow them to achieve their precise functions. The course will be a combination of both lectures and student-lead discussion of recent literature.
