Grading is based primarily on students' literary understanding. There will be four 2-page written assignments over the course of the semester. We will discuss literary works that reflect Israelis' struggle with their national identity, from the patriotic 1948 generation for whom self and country overlapped to contemporary writers who ask what it means to be Israeli. While Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem \"I want to die in my bed\" was a manifesto for individualism, the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict returned writers to the national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980's. Readings include poems by Natan Alterman, Amir Gilboa, Meir Wieseltier and Roni Somek as well as fiction by Amos Oz, David Grossman, Sayed Kashua, Alona Kimhi and Etgar Keret. Texts, discussions and papers in Hebrew. The content of this course changes from year to year so students may take it for credit more than once.",

While the focus of the course will be on the Akeidah, we will also use this text as a test-case to study the history of how Jews read, and why the interpretations of this story differ so radically. Attention will also be paid to contemporary Christian and Islamic interpretations. All texts will be read in the original Hebrew, and students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts, but no other previous experience in reading these texts is necessary.",

In addition to studying the primary texts, the course will also explore the historical, religious, and cultural contexts in which these texts were first produced and then studied, and the aspects of Jewish historical experience that these texts reflect. The specific topic of the course (eg. Medieval Biblical Interpretation, Kabbalah) will vary from semester to semester. In some cases, the specific topic may also be the work of a specific author, like Maimonides. Primary sources will be read in their original Hebrew. While no previous experience in studying these texts is required, students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts. If there is a question as to whether the course is appropriate for you, please contact the professor.",

This graduate level course will reconstruct some of the underlying problems with this claim and suggest that examination of developments in the broader Roman, Christian and Islamic societies offer alternate ways of accounting for the emergence of these Jewish subcultures in the Middle Ages. Topics to be explored include cultural-geographic patterns following the collapse of the Roman Empire; divergent approaches to Islamic law under the abbasid and Umayyad caliphates; genres of legal composition in different parts of the Islamic world, and the status of aggadah (i.e., non-legal rabbinic tradition) in medieval Ashkenaz and Sephardic traditions.

The diction is simple, often colloquial, but the stories reflect an exciting inner world and a stormy outer reality. For Hebrew writers, the short story has been a favorite genre since the Renaissance of Hebrew literature in the 19th century until now, when Hebrew literature is vibrant in a country where Hebrew is spoken. The lion share of the course focuses on authors who emerged in the last 25 years like Orly Kastel-Bloom, Alex Epstein, Almog Bahar. Student level and literary taste will influence the choice of works. The content of this course changes from year to year, so students may take it for credit more than once.

In this course, we will trace the history of the interpretation of this text in classical Jewish literature, from early post-Biblical interpretations found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, through Rabbinic midrash, and into the various medieval commentators--Rashi, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Radak, Ramban, and still others. While the focus of the course will be on the Akeidah, we will also use this text as a test-case to study the history of how Jews read, and why the interpretations of this story differ so radically. Attention will also be paid to contemporary Christian and Islamic interpretations. All texts will be read in the original Hebrew, and students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts, but no other previous experience in reading these texts is necessary.",

While Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem \"I want to die in my bed\" was a manifesto for individualism, the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict returned writers to the national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980's. Readings include poems by Natan Alterman, Amir Gilboa, Meir Wieseltier and Roni Somek as well as fiction by Amos Oz, David Grossman, Sayed Kashua, Alona Kimhi and Etgar Keret.
