Common early responses are stress, anxiety, depression, fear, and anger. Over time, with support and experience with the illness, many adjust. But, others report persistent feelings of loss due to physical, emotional, spiritual/existential, social, occupational, and/or financial influences of chronic illness. Those who adjust the best typically find a way to return a sense of normalcy to their lives. Loved ones and caregivers are equally affected by chronic illness and much has been written in recent years about caregiver burden. However, some individuals (caregivers and patients) report positive responses to illness, including a deepened purpose for living and a reordering of life priorities. The focus of this course is on individual responses to chronic illness- the person diagnosed and his/her loved ones. This course is intended to complement N818, which focuses on families and dyads dealing with chronic illness. In this course we will explore the major theoretical perspectives that underlie this field. The literature describing common responses of both those diagnosed and their loved ones as well as the social and cultural context that helps explain the responses of individuals facing chronic illness will be examined. Methods used to study chronic illness will be explored in depth.",

It consists of individualized clinical experiences that are integrally related to the student's area of research interest and which are facilitated by clinician guides in a variety of settings. Students actively participate in seminars that focus on examining the health needs of individuals and vulnerable patients, the praxis of nursing and its place within the complex health care delivery system, health policy and society at large. Research informing practice and practice informing research are highlighted using the clinical practice experiences as case exemplars. NURS 803 is a course designed specifically for two groups of PhD students: the Hillman Scholars in Nursing Innovation and post-baccalaureate students completing an MS in passing who have limited clinical experience as a professional nurse. This course is designed to expose students to carefully selected clinical experiences that provide opportunities to build a clinical appreciation of the practice of nursing as an intellectual discipline, to gain an enhanced understanding of the health care delivery system, and to examine the intersection of research, policy, and practice at the frontlines of nursing practice. To this end, this course combines the clinical experiences with a weekly seminar facilitated to dissect common issues experienced by vulnerable patients and families across care settings and specialties, to critically examine the contributions of nursing science to that care, and to examine how the health care system contributes or detracts from optimal care.",

Examination emphasizes gendered notions of beauty and sexuality in ageing and the life span to foster discourse around historical notions and images of beauty and ugliness in late life in contrast to contemporary messages of attractiveness and age represented by both women and men. The course is designed to create intellectual foundations as place from which to critique socially mediated and personally conveyed images and messages from a variety of media and their influence on intrapersonal and interpersonal constructions and social processes. Contemporary and historical ideas encompassing stereotypical and idealized views of the older person are employed to reflect dialogue around readings and field work. Classical and contemporary scholarship from gerontology, anthropology, biomedicine and surgery, nursing, and marketing among other disciplines as well as select lay literature are critiqued and compared with interpretation of field work to build understandings of diverse individual, familial, and cultural impressions of aging and identity. Skills for participant observer field work in the tradition of thick description are built to allow reflection and analysis of discourse about aging, beauty, sexuality, and other relevant aspects of human identity.

A variety of sources are employed to introduce students from any field focused on human behavior and interaction to classical notions of social gerontology and current scholarly inquiry in gerontology. Field work in the tradition of thick thickdescription creates a mechanism to engage students in newly gerontological understandings of their life worlds and daily interactions. Weekly field work, observing aspects of age and representations of aging and being old in every day experiences forms, is juxtaposed against close critical readings of classical works in social gerontology and current research literature as well as viewings of film and readings of popular literature as the basis for student analysis. Student participation in the seminar demands careful scrutiny and critical synthesis of disparate intellectual, cultural, and social perspectives using readings and field work and creation of oral and written arguments that extend understandings of the issues at hand in new and substantive ways. Emphasis is placed on analysis of field work and literature through a series of media reports and a final term paper. Creative approaches to identifying literature, analyzing field work and representing critique are encouraged.

It emphasizes the links between the past and present, using not only primary documents but materials from disciplines such as literature, art, sociology, and feminist studies that relate both closely and tangentially to the health professions and health care issues. Discussions will surround gender, class-based, ethnic, and racial ideas about the construction of disease, health and illness; the development of health care institutions; the interplay between religion and science; the experiences of patients and providers; and the response to disasters and epidemics. Skills for document analysis and critique are built into the course as is the contextual foundation for understanding the history of health care. This course satisfies both the Society & Social Structures and the Histories & Traditions sectors for the Nursing Class of 2012 and beyond.",

In the lecture component, the focus is on the integration of knowledge and skill for nursing practice and develops the ability of students to see nursing practice as part of a complex system. It examines systems thinking and complexity, development of a leadership role and skills, inter-professional communication and teamwork, and leading change in healthcare organizations. This course also examines the nurse's role in improvement science and patient care delivery, focusing on quality improvement processes, patient safety, nurse sensitive process and outcome metrics with micro-systems. This course also allows students to develop the capacity for clinical expertise, leadership, and for translating the science of the profession into practice. Students also are assigned to a seminar component that is correlated with their selected site for the specialty clinical practicum. This aspect of the course allows the student to develop additional expertise in a specialty area of practice and to develop competences specific to that population of patients. These seminar components are adult health and illness; adult critical care, obstetrics/labor & delivery, psychiatric/mental health, and pediatrics. Advanced simulation experiences and extensive clinical practice in an area of the students' choice provide multiple opportunities to synthesize the multidimensional aspects of nursing, and provide the environment which facilitates transition to professional nursing practice. Students select from a variety of settings in which to refine their practice skills. Principles of leadership, accountability and change will be applied to clinical practice as the student begins to operationalize the professional nursing role. Emphasis is placed on the nurse as a knowledgeable provider of health care who is both a change agent and advocate.",

It focuses on the knowledge and skill acquisition needed to care for these patients at particular moments, across the continuum of care, and through transitions in an illness experience. It addresses nursing phenomena of concern including the unique set of principles and body of knowledge and skills necessary to the practice of nursing with older adults. Students are provided with the theoretical background necessary to understand health system issues affecting older adults. Students will attain the knowledge necessary to complete a comprehensive assessment of the older adult's physical, functional, psychosocial, and cognitive capacities. Common problems associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, sensory, and genitourinary systems that affect older adults will be discussed. In addition, principles of continuity of care, rehabilitation, nutritional and pharmacodynamic changes, cultural diversity and ethics will be integrated throughout the course. Clinical experiences in acute care hospitals and simulation experiences provide sufficient opportunities for clinical reasoning, clinical care, and knowledge integration. Special emphasis is placed on transitional care for older adults across the health care continuum.",
