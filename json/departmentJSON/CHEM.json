Applications to cellular and in vivo imaging are highlighted for confocal, two-photon, and force microscopies; single-molecule, CARS, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; FRET and fluorescence bleaching; mass spectroscopy; MRI, PET and SPECT. The role of molecular imaging agents comprised of proteins, organic or inorganic materials is widely discussed.",

We will do some simple experiments that demonstrate some of these principles. We will follow the development of the chemical sciences from the works of early alchemists to Renaissance (Newton andBoyle) scientists and modern thinkers (Priestly, Lavoisier, Dalton, Mendeleev and others). This class, which is designed for non-science as well as potentialscience majors, will involve discussions on readings, as well as field trips tosome Philadelphia locations that are notable in the history of chemistry.",
