Students will be challenged to consider whether there is a unique Chinese Ethic , or whether Chinese culture and practice can be understood as harmonized with Western values and morals. Specific topics include: Ethical considerations in outsourcing clinical trials to China; Pharmaceutical marketing practices in China; Physician-Patient interactions and the notions of autonomy; Ethics in health policy; Intellectual property and the regulatory landscape; Challenges in conducting busines and research in China, including organizational practices and business Ethics. Course Format: Students will travel to Bejing, Nanjing and Shanghai where the program will include site visits, academic lectures, and meetings with policymakers, Chinese and expatriate business leaders and others. Visits to significant cultural sites will also be included. Class meetings will be held prior to and following the trip to China and will include distinguished guest speakers from the US and abroad. Student Requirements/Evaluation: Students will be required to read all assigned articles and book chapters and to come to class sessions prepared for discussion. 25% of the course grade will be based on student participation in the breakfast journal club and guest presentations. Students will be required to write a 10-15 page research paper on some aspect of bioethics in China. This paper will count towards 50% of the final grade. Students will be asked to present their paper at the post-trip class, and this presentation will count for the remaining 25% of the course grade.",

Not surprisingly, the success of mediation and a wider understanding of the process, has led to its application in the realm of healthcare disputes with encouraging results. This course will initially provide an overview of classical mediation theory and practice. Students will be introduced to negotiation fundamentals critical to the practice of mediation. Similarities and differences between mediation in the healthcare field, as distinct from other contexts, will be examined. All class members will participate in mediation role-plays designed to simulate disputes of the kind prevalent in healthcare landscape",

The course will focus on the challenges facing the health care system, an in-depth understanding of the Affordable Care Act, and its potential impact upon health care access, delivery, cost, and quality. The U.S. health care system is the worlds largest, most technologically advanced, most expensive, with uneven quality, and an unsustainable cost structure. This multi-disciplinary course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system and the impact of the Affordable Care Act. How did the United States get here? The course will examine the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. As the Affordable Care Act is implemented over the next decade, the U.S. will witness tremendous changes that will shape the American health care system for the next 50 years of more. The course will examine potential reforms, including those offered by liberals and conservatives and information that can be extracted from health care systems in other developed countries. The second half of the course will explore key facets of the Affordable Care Act, including improving access to care and health insurance exchanges, improving quality and constraining costs through health care delivery system reforms, realigning capacity through changes in workforce and medical education, and potential impact on biomedical and other innovation. The course will also examine the political context and process of passing major legislation in general and health care legislation in particular, including constitutional arguments surrounding the Affordable Care Act. Throughout lessons will integrate the disciplines of health economics, health and social policy, law and political science to elucidate key principles.",

These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals, what is called micro-allocation decisions. There are also macro-allocation decisions that focus on how health care systems distributes resources across populations. Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and oncology drug shortages, the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals. Using both the need to establish priorities for global health aid and to define an essential benefit package for health insurance, the course will critically examine diverse theories for macro-allocation from cost-effectiveness analysis to age-based rationing to accountability for reasonableness.",
