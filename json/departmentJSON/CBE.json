Wherever possible, will make connections between classical, macroscopic transport, and what is happening microscopically. Will make use of a comination of analytic and algorithmic/numerical methods to facilitate understanding of the material. Physical topics will include stochastic, \"single-molecule\", non-ideal, hard sphere and frustrated systems, phase transitions, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and optics. Concepts will include properties of stochastic functions (Gaussian statistics, correlation functions and power spectra), Fourier methods, Convolution, the Central Limit theorem, anomalous diffusion, percolation, and the Fluctuation/Dissipation theorem. Computational methods will concentrate on Monte Carlo simulations of \"toy\" models.",

This course teaches entry-level knowledge in polymer synthesis, characterization, thermodynamics, and structure-property relationship. Emphasis will be on understanding both chemical and physical aspects and polymer chain size/dimension that drive the molecular, microscopic and macroscopic structures and the resulting properties. We will discuss how to apply polymer designs to advance nanotechnology, electronics, energy and biotechnology. Case studies include thermodynamics of block copolymer thin films and their applications in nanolithography, shape memory polymers, hydrogels, and elastomeric deformation and applications.",

    "course_description" : "This course is designed for students to understand the fundamental characteristics of fluids. We will develop, starting from first principles, the basic equations for fluid statics, and use them to assess buoyancy forces and determine the pressure variations in fluids with rigid body rotation. Students will understand in detail the basic types of fluid flow line patterns (eg. streamlines and streamtubes) and the different types of interchangeable energy forms (eg. kinetic, potential, and pressure). It is also important to develop, starting from first principles, the formulations for inviscid and viscous flow problems. These include the discussion of a control system and system boundaries, the detailed construction of conservations equations of mass, energy, and momentum for Newtonian fluids, the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations, and the determination of appropriate initial and boundary conditions. A final objective of the course is to solve various fluid mechanics problems using control systems, dimensional analysis, and developed equations. Such problems include, but are not limited to, the terminal velocity of a falling sphere, Stokes flow, the relation between the friction factor and the Reynolds number, and flow profiles in numerous geometries.",

In this context, we will focus on several topics, including signal transduction and the molecular regulation of cell function, cellular microenvironment, cell adhesion and mechanics, stem cells, multicellularity, and experimental models of tissue develpment.",
