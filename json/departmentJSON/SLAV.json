    "course_description" : "The course is a one-semester survey of literary, philosophical, political and socio-religious issues in Ukraine from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 21st century. Its goal is to introduce students to an understanding of individual and collective thought in Ukrainian history and enable them to determine Ukraine's role in the making of contemporary Europe. Interdisciplinary in nature and comparative in methodology, the survey focuses on the principal works of imaginative literature and philosophical writings. Following a theoretical and historical introduction and placing the subject matter within the European context, selected works of Ukrainian classicism and romanticism will be analyzed and interpreted as roots of modern Ukrainian identity. An attempt will be made to point out the elective affinities of Ukrainian intellectuals with their European counterparts and to demonstrate the organic unity of Ukraine's culture with that of Western Europe. The survey will conclude with an analysis of post-modernistic intellectual currents and intellectual life in Ukraine following the Orange Revolution of 2004/05.",

    "course_description" : "The seminar will examine a range of topics in Medieval Studies viewing European medieval civilization as encompassing the whole (\"global\") geographic and cultural space of Europe and ignoring reference to contemporary socio-political division of Europe into \"Western\" and \"Eastern.\" As a case study, the course focuses on the 14th-century Holy Roman Empire from Henry VII to the Emperor Sigismund, and particularly on the reign of Charles IV, in a context in which Prague becomes the imperial capital and Bohemia a center of Europe. A detailed examination of this monarch's vision of a \"Global Europe\" will allow us to explore a network of connections, a network that stretches from Prague to the farthermost western, eastern and southern corners of the European continent. We will examine correspondences and differences between various linguistic, textual, political, and religious communities, while attempting to show how Latin and Slavic European cultures were interwoven. Some of the titles from the reading list are Charles IV's The Life of St. Wenceslas and Autobiography, The Golden Bull, Dante's Letters & Monarchia, Machaut's Jugement of the King of Bohemia, Petrarch's Epistolae & Poems, Froissart's Prison of Love, Johannes von Tepl's The Plowman of Bohemia, The Life of St. Constantin the Philosopher, fragments from Czech, French, Italian, Polish, Hungarian and Rus medieval chronicles, etc. All reading will be done in English, with original language versions always available.",

It explores the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language to explain and communicate the essence of human experience. The idea that the language spoken in the Garden of Eden was a language which perfectly expressed the essence of all possible objects and concepts has occupied the minds of scholars for more than two millennia. In defiance of the myth of the Tower of Babel and the confusion of languages, they strived to overcome divine punishment and discover the path back to harmonious existence. For philosophers, the possibility of recovering or recreating a universal language would enable apprehension of the laws of nature. For theologians, it would allow direct experience of the divinity. For mystic-cabalists it would offer access to hidden knowledge. For nineteenth-century philologists the reconstruction of the proto-language would enable a better understanding of human history. For contemporary scholars, linguistic universals provide structural models both for human and artificial languages. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the idea of a universal and perfect language has been an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Above all, the course examines fundamental questions of what language is and how it functions. Among the course readings are works by Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Dante, Horapollo, Bacon, Giordano Bruno, John Wilkins, Cyrano de Bergerac, Jonathan Swift, and Zamenhof.",

The object of inquiry will be construed broadly, to include all manner of historiographic, artistic, filmic, literary and rhetorical representation of the past. Each of the three segments of the course will begin with examination of important theoretical readings in conjunction with case studies in major European traditions that have been among the central foci of this theoretical work (French Revolutionary history, Holocaust, English nationalism). Next we will add analogous Russian cases to the picture (Russian Revolution, Gulag memory, Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great as national myths). Finally, at the conclusion of each segment students will bring theoretical tools to bear on the national traditions and contexts relevant to their own work. Our readings in the theory and philosophy of history and historiography will include works by: Anderson, Caruth, Guha, Hegel, LaCapra, Putnam, Ricoeur, White and others.",

In this course, we will study key texts, statements and debates that define these issues, and will work towards a broad knowledge of the complex rewriting of the project of literary studies in process today. The reading list will keep in mind the Examination List in Comparative Literature we will not work towards complete coverage but will ask how crucial contemporary theorists engage with the longer history and institutional practices of literary criticism. There will be no examinations. Students will make one class presentation, which will then be reworked into a paper (1200-1500 words) to be submitted one week after the presentation. A second paper will be an annotated bibliography on a theoretical issue or issues that a student wishes to explore further. The bibliography will be developed in consultation with the instructor; it will typically include three or four books and six to eight articles or their equivalent. The annotated bibliography will be prefaced by a five or six page introduction; the whole will add up to between 5000 and 6000 words of prose. Students will prepare position notes each week, which will either be posted on a weblog or circulated in class.",

The course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the evolution of the main cultural paradigms of Russian Orthodoxy viewed in a broader European context. Although this course is historical in content, it is also about modern Russia. The legacy of Medieval Rus' is still referenced, often allegorically, in contemporary social and cultural discourse as the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian societies attempt to reconstruct and reinterpret their histories. In this course, students learn that the study of the medieval cultural and political history explains many aspects of modern Russian society, its culture and mentality. The legacy of the Rus Middle Ages has a continuing cultural influence in modern Russia. This legacy is still referenced, often allegorically, in contemporary social and cultural discourse as the society attempts to reconstruct and reinterpret its history. Similarly, the study of the medieval cultural history of Rus explains many aspects of modern Russian society, and, in particular, the roots of its Imperial political mentality. Those interested in the intellectual and cultural history of Russia, and Eastern Europe in general, will find that this course greatly enhances their understanding of the region and its people.",

The continent will be considered as a geographical and cultural space and the construction of its identity will be examined through several historical periods-from the Middle Ages to Modernism--comprising the rich layer of pan-European civilization across the ethnic or national borders. Finally, the structure of the European Union will be scrutinized including its institutions, decision-making mechanism, shared currency, collective security, and Europe's changing relationship with the USA. Participants will be encouraged to select a particular topic in European studies and research it through assigned readings, film, literature, and other media. The individual projects will be developed through consultations with the instructor into a class presentation leading to a final paper (about 6,000 words).",
