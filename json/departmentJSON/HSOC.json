Surgeons had a reputation as dirty, blood-thirsty \"barbarians,\" and patients rarely sought out their services. But all of this changed during the twentieth century. Today surgery is one of the most prestigious medical specialties, and patients-especially those who long to look younger, thinner, and trimmer-voluntarily submit to multiple procedures. This course will investigate the cultural and scientific sources of these dramatic changes, with readings ranging from graphic descriptions of \"bonesetting\" and suturing during the Middle Ages to contemporary accounts of childbirth and plastic surgery in antisepctic hospitals anc clinics.",

Families, policy makers, schools and the healthcare system have argued bitterly in the press and in the courts about the best way to cre for these children and the best ways to pay for this care. In this class, we will use autism as a case study to understnad how psychiatric and developmental disorders of childhood come to be defined over time, their biologocal and environmental causes identified, and treatments developed.

This course is designed to examine the meanings of race, in particular the ones that have been thought to have a scientific or biological foundation. We will examine the origins of these questions of race from the end of the 19th century to the present, and the way that the genetic science of race has shaped social policy and has changed over time. Most of our focus will be on the United States, but we will also set these questions in a transnational perspective.",

This course will examine the ways in which the Greeks, and then the Romans, conceptualized the body, disease, and healing, and will compare these to medical culture of our time. We will consider sources from Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle to Galen and Soranus, and will juxtapose these writings with modern discourse about similar topics. We will also pay some attention to ancient pharmacology and religious healing, and will visit the Penn Museum to see their collection of ancient medical instruments. All readings will be in English and no previous background in Classical Studies is required. This course will be especially appealing (and useful) to Pre-med and Nursing students, and to students interested in the History of Science, Ancient Philosophy, and Classics.",

Students will have the chance to conduct ethnographic interviews, and will write final research papers that integrate this ethnographic material, along with library material, in the study of a particular gendered medical experience in the U.S. or another region of the world.

High-level public policy, seemingly remote from the day-to-day stuff of life and death, has a profound impact on the basic living conditions of a majority of the world's people. The aim in this course is to understand how development policy--for example, the outcome of World Trade Organization negotiations--affects the health of poor people. We look at how the practice of international development has been shaped, over the past sixty years and more, by political interests with no straightforward bearing on the kinds of health outcomes we might assume to be the aims of development. We relate current and emerging trends in development--microfinance, climate justice--to the history of policy agendas at the national and international level. By the course's end, students will have a critical, historically informed perspective on the practice of international development. Each student will develop an original research paper over the course of the term and have the chance to present research in progress to the group. This course fulfills the capstone requirement for the Health and Societies major.",

If medical historieans and queer theorists have paid almost obsessive attention to these subjects, contemporary scientific theorists and bioethicists have intervened t0 a lesser degree and on only a handful of relevant subjects. Bearing in mind the social and medical legacies related to sexual and gender identities, this course will consider a range of historical and contemporary topics which speak to the intersection of bioethical dilemmas on medicine, sexuality and gender identity, including: the gay adolescent, the intersex person, gay conversion therapies, the prospect of gay gene studies, sex addiction, queer blood/organ donation policies, transgender politics, and the wake of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.",

Many of the readings will examine birth from an unapologetically feminist and/or holistic perspective, and we will discuss the psychological, political, cultural and spiritual dimensions of birth practices. We will also consider the impact of increasingly sophisticated medical technology on conception and pregnancy, including in vitro fertilization, surrogate mothers, and extending the childbearing years well into late life.

Yet even at the beginning to the twentieth century, medical technolgies were scarce and infrequently used by physicians and medical consumers alike.

As the concepts of health and disease are socially and culturally determined, so has the doctor-patient relationship undergone significant social and cultural change. The place the doctor has held in society, as well as the expectations of both the doctor and the patient have changed dramatically in the last century. In addition, striking advances in science and technology and changes in the delivery of healthcare, particularly in the last half of the 20th century, have shaped the pactice of medicine and by necessity have influenced the relationship between doctor and patient. The course will focus primarily on the evolution of the doctor-patient relationshp over the last century from boththe doctor's and patient's perspective.",

The course has two principal goals: (1)to give students a practical introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of the history of medicine, and (2)to foster a nuanced, critical understanding of medicine's complex role in contemporary society. The couse takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient,the physician,and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to \"treat\" healthy people as well as the sick and infirm. Rather than history \"from the top down\"or \"from the bottom up,\"this course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means, first, that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriously,on their own terms, rather than judging them by todays's standards. Required readings consist largely of primary sources, from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments will encourge students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras.",

Biological and social factors can account for some of this variation. However, there is increasing evidence that behavior- and the cultural models that are linked to health behavior- play an important role too. Cognitive anthropology is the study of how people in social groups conceive of objects and events in their world. It provides a framework for understanding how members of different groups categorize illness and treatment. It also helps to explain why risk perception, helpseeking behavior, and decision making styles vary to the extent they do. This seminar will explore the history of cognitive anthropology, schema theory, connectionism, the role of cultural models, and factors affecting health decision making. Methods for identifying cultural models will be discussed and practiced. Implications for health communication will be discussed.",

The result of a lack of cleary cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses, where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus, or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol i the college community.",

This course is designed to provide you with a basic understanding of research in the social sciences and to enable you to think like a social scientist. Through this course students will learn both the logic of sociological inquiry and the nuts and bolts of doing empirical research. We will focus on such issues as the relationship between theory and research, the logic of research design, issues of conceptualization and measurement, basic methods of data collection, and what social scientists do with data once they have collected them. By the end of the course, students will have completed sociological research projets utilizing different empirical methods, be able to evaluate the strenths and weaknesses of various research strategies, and read (with understanding) published accounts of social science research.",

The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth.

This course will examine the ways in which the Greeks conceptualized the body, disease, and healing, and will compare these to medical culture of our own time. We will consider sources from Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle to Galen and Soranus, and whenever possible we will juxtapose these writings with modern discourse about similar topics.

This seminar will examine this everyday bio/medical ethics from an ethnographic point of view. Topics include medical error, birth, death, population control, poverty, race global medical experimentation and corporate responsibility. We will read works by social scientists of medicine that chronicle ordinary people's struggles and the bioethics quandaries that accompany them, and in doing so will distinguish between the everyday moral experiences of people all over the world faced with difficult choices, and the ethical ideals to which they aspire. We will then ask: how can these perspectives be reconciled? When trying to reconcile these perspectives, how can we account for powerful dynamics of race, gender, class religion, and cultural difference that infuse everyday medical decision-making? And finally, how can we develop a code of ethics that takes these issues into account and is also fundamentally connected to the moral lives of the particular individuals who are affected? Is this even possible?",

Using a variety of highly engaging approaches (in-class discussions, examination of primary research, popular media, simple experiments, expert panel debates) this highly interactive seminar will provide students a strong introductory foundation to medical decision making specifically and, by extension to decision making under conditions of uncertainty more generally.

A range of methods including archival research, oral history, qualitative interviews, ethnography, cyber-ethnography, media and cultural studies will be explored.

From the Black Death to cholera to AIDS, epidemics have wrought profound demographic, social, political and cultural change all over the world. Such is the power of their mystery and horror that while thousands die everyday in the United States from mundane illnesses such as heart disese or lung cancer, panic grips the land at the thought of a handful of deaths from seemingly exotic affictions such as West Nile encephalitis and \"weaponized\" anthrax. Through a detailed analysis of specific historical outbreaks, this seminar will investigate the causes and effects of epidemic disease, and will examine the ways in which different societies in different eras have responded in times of crisis.",

Each week, through a specific case study, framed by a few theoretical readings, we will attempt to deepen and problematize the simple definition of globalization with which we start the course. Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on combining case study-based empirical material with theoretical interventions in Cultural Theory and Postcolonial Studies.",

In this class we will explore how medical professionals, scientists and the general population have historically understood the ways in which the environment impacts different people, in different places, in different ways. We will interrogate medical theories that underpinned popular practices, like health tourism, public health campaigns, and colonial medical programs. We will also consider how people constructed and understood the physical environment, including farms and factories, cemeteries and cities, to be healthy or not. This course is designed to foster a collaborative atomsphere in which students will complete an original research paper through critical reading and step-wise assignments that will culminate in a final project.",

Many of these vertical programs were at first implemented with little consideration of specific local circumstances regarding difference in disease burden, transmission pathways, microbial strain, existing local treatment and control approaches, significant historical factors, or type and degree of suffering. Recent campaigns have attempted to revisit the problem of the \"local.\" This course examines some of the most influential of these global vertical disease control campaigns from the 1950s through the present. Our goal will be to elucidate some of the crucial factors that have shaped local experiences of the relevant diseases, and that have influenced the direction and outcome of vertical control efforts at the local and global levels. Students will extensively research a particular campaign and its potential effects in a geographical location and time period of their choice.",

Topics of this course will include, but are not limited to, cell development and stem cell biology, wich form the basis of the emerging field of Regenerative Medicine. Penn students will reinforce their learning of these concepts by mentoring high school students, demonstrations by Penn scientists, and a co-teaching method involving Penn faculty and a partnering high school teacher. A primary goal of this course is to expose both Penn and high school students to cutting edge science and its societal impact. Through this course Penn students will learn critical skills that can help them bring scientific ideas to professionals, and important to any educated professional.",
