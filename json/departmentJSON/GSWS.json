According to Darwin, the meaning of facial expressions and emotions are consistent across cultures and are universally understood. Modern scholarship would have us believe that notions of human beauty are framed by facial symmetry and reproductive fitness, while fashion magazines seem to challenge both these claims. What role does technology play in communicating and shaping ideas of beauty? By the same token, to what extent is technology deployed in service of the ideas of those behind the lens? In this course, we will explore changing notions of beauty and their relationship to the technologies and media through which it is viewed.",

We will interrogate the transnational and transcultural mobility of specific aesthetics as well as racial and sexual identity categories more broadly using ethnography, poetry, painting, film, photography and literature. Our aim is to use the prism of artistry to highlight the dynamic relationship between African Diaspora Studies and Queer Studies.",

We are also aware that individuals undergo sex reassignment surgeries but by and large we assume that transgender people are transitioning from one discrete category to another. Queer activists certainly challenge this assumption, preferring to envision sex, gender, and sexuality on a continuum, but these days even scientists don't concur about a definitive definition of sex. Should sex be defined chiefly by anatomy? Chromosomes? The body's ability to produce and respond to hormones? If the boundaries of biological categories can be contested, what are the implications for culturally constructed ideas about gender identity and sexuality.",

It affects every aspect of people's lives, from their intimate relationships to their participation in work, family, government, and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system, Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior, power,and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender, in contrast, emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained, with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.",

Building on previous efforts by female reformers to perfect society, women at the turn of the century organized large social movements dedicated to improving the lives of women and children and gaining public access to political power. We will examine the fruits of this activism as well as the consequences of subsequent events for the rise of several important social movements in the latter half of the century -- including civil rights, women's liberation, and gay rights -- in which women played a vital role. The course concludes with an assessment of feminism in the present day, with special emphasis on the responses of younger women to its legacy.",

But women in these two Muslim countries have sought to break the barriers of their regidly patriarchal societies while refusing to surrender their identity as Muslims. Understanding how they have fared could hold the key to how women in South Asia and other parts of the Muslim world negotiate their autonomy and reclaim their right to participate as equal citizens on their own terms. At the same time, no women's movement anywhere can develop in isolation. Therefore, this course will explore lines of conflict and co-operation between women and other groups in society, such as the rural peasantry, the urban poor, migrant labor, students and peace activists.",

We will explore the idea of sexuality as a category of social identity, probing the identities of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender to try and understand what they really mean in various cultural, social, and political milieus. In doing so, we will ask: What does it mean to study queerness? What do we mean by \"queer studies\"? How do institutions - religious, legal, scientific - shape our understandings of queer identities? In what ways do sexuality and gender interact, and how does this interaction inform the meanings of each of these identity categories? How do other social categories of identification - race, ethnicity, class, etc. - affect the ways in which we understand expressions of queerness? What does studying queerness tell us about the workings of contemporary political, cultural, and social life? What is normal and who/what is it that defines and controls normalcy?",

This course will survey Livia's different literary and material representationsand attempt to come to terms with the various perspectives on the first empress presented by these texts and contexts. Livia provides a key figure through whom students will be exposed to various issues surrounding the portrayal of Roman women in the early empire. Through lecture and discussion, we will relate Livia to her contemporary world, and then examine the role of imperial women through the rest of the Julio-Claudian era and beyond. We will discover Livia's influence in creating the role of the empress, and analyze the differences between her representation as an ideal and that of later imperial women. Students will write brief response papers to primary texts and present on select secondary readings that add to our understanding of the portrayal of Livia and imperial women more generally.",

This advanced undergraduate course will examine this question from disciplinary perspectives across the social sciences and humanities, with a particular focus on ethnographic inquiry. The main theme students will explore is that sex, gender and sexuality are social relations produced through the interplay of individual desires and social norms, not innate facets of self or personhood. The course will survey theoretical and practical discussions over the possibilities and limitations of envisioning both sexual marginality and normativity as sites for political action by engaging in assignments that get students to apply what they learn in class to real-world contexts.\"",

Why juxtapose such distinct figures? Are they doing the same job? The course discusses the interplay between ugliness and politics with focus on a number of central concepts such as race, social conflict, nationalism, ideology, dictatorship, propaganda and autonomy. Emphasis is put on the double role of the deployment of ugliness, as reinforcement of ideological and political ideas and as a force of social criticism. How does the state justify its own existence by the use of aesthetic narratives? How does the State identify undesirables? This class highlights how groups who feel somatically alike behave, and how their boundaries form and change over time. The focus will be interdisciplinary and multi-national, with case studies from past and present. The class will have a digital media focus as we will delve into issues of representation particularly with respect to race. For example, we will delve into the aesthetic discussion of northern and southern Sudanese as well and Hitler's Germany.",

    "course_description" : "Unlike Impressionism, Cubism and Minimalism, Contemporary Art refers neither to a specific historical period, nor a recognizable aesthetic. We cannot say with any certainty when it began or whether it will ever end, because it is tied to the most unstable or temporal categories: the \"now.\" Contemporary Art is also culturally and geographically heterogeneous, and it encompasses every kind of aesthetic activity, provided it can be linked to the present or the recent pass. Its histories are consequently both multiple, and highly unstable, and it is only from the perspective of a particular \"here\" and \"now\" that we can recount any of them. One of the most striking features of today's art world is the conspicuous place occupied in it by the photographic image. Large scale color photographs and time-based installations and projections are everywhere. Looking back, we can see that much of the art making of the past 60 years has also been defined by this medium, regardless of the form it takes. Photographic images have inspired countless paintings, appeared in combines and installations, morphed into sculptures, drawings and performances, and served both as the object and the vehicle of institutional critique. They are also an increasingly important exhibition site: where most of us go to see earthworks, happenings and body-art. This course will be a three-part exploration of our photographic present. In the first part, we will look at the role played by the photographic image in the post World War II \"return to the world. In the second part, we will examine the suspicion under which this image falls in teh 1970's and 1980's, and the derealization to which it is subjected. In the third part, we will focus on artists who adopt a very different relationship to photography: who see it as a \"trace,\" instead of a representation, and use it to mourn what is gone, remember what has been forgotten or repressed, and reorient themselves to others and the world.",

The readings represent some of the newest scholarship as well as several more familiar texts to provide an understanding of how some of the latest developments in feminist theory have come to pass. In the first six weeks we will explore general methodological issues, and then turn to a consideration of theories that attempt to grapple with more specific political issues.

This seminar considers art at the margins and how it reimagines the visual to perform a rebuttal to male dominated art are scenes, heteronormative aesthetics, and racist art markets. Working at the intersection of queer studies, feminist art historical practice, theater, and cinema studies, we will interrogate the aesthetics of indentity politics. How does feminist art compel new directions in the way we conceive of labor, value, process, and circulation? How do art practices contest and rewrite normative meanings of bodily and sexual difference? Our class privileges art as a transformative mode of language and critique as we bridge visual culture and scholarship to create multiple lenses of analysis. We will consider diverse genres, for example, body art, photography, film, process art, literature and epistolary forms. We will examine how amateurism, deskilling, display, and objectification become strategic performances of feminist and queer identities and political refusal. Configurations of community, such as appropriation, co-optation, \"selling out,\" and safe space will be interrogated. Finally, we will look at the \"Occupy Museum\" movement to think about the institutionalization of marginalized art forms and makers.",

    "course_description" : "This course seeks to assemble some of the philosophical evidence for feminist claims that traditional political theories are fundamentlaly inadequate because they have not, and presumably cannot, deal with basic facts of gender and the oppression of Women. We will begin by examining the nature of the distinction between sex and gender. This will take us through discussions of: the meaning and significance of categories being socially constructed, the possibility that sexual differences (and inequalities) are in some sense natural and what normative force this has. We will then consider varous attempts to describe the nature of women's oppression. What is it? How does it manifest itself in the lives of women? This will take us through discussions of freedom, constrained choice, ideology, \"consciousness raising\", androcentrism and the relation between, and methodological importance of, ideal and non-ideal theory. Along the way we will be constructing a version of the feminist framework known as the dominance approach and seeing how it analyzes three presumed sites of oppression: sexuality, reproduction and work/family. Among the authors we will be reading are: Elizabeth Anderson, Marily Frye, Sally Haslanger, Rae Langton, Anthony Laden, Catherine MacKinnon, and Susan Okin. The prerequisite for UNDERGRADUATES taking this course is: two philosophy courses (ONE of which is in moral or political philosophy) OR ONE of the following Gender Studies courses: GSWS/PHIL 028, GSWS/PoliSci 280, GSWS 320. There will be one short paper (6-8 pages) with revision, a longer final paper (15 pages) and weekly one-page reflections on a topic from the previous week's discussion.",

Students will have the chance to conduct ethnographic interviews, and will write final research papers that integrate this ethnographic material, along with library material, in the study of a particular gendered medical experience in the U.S. or another region of the world.

Many of the readings will examine birth from an unapologetically feminist and/or holistic perspective, and we will discuss the psychological, political, cultural and spiritual dimensions of birth practices. We will also consider the impact of increasingly sophisticated medical technology on conception and pregnancy, including in vitro fertilization, surrogate mothers, and extending the childbearing years well into late life. An important theme throughout will be the concept of \"appropriate technology\" -- which technologies are appropriate and who decides?

Students will engage a number of disciplinary perspectives within the social sciences including the history, sociology, and anthropology of science, and we will pay particular attention to feminist, queer, and postcolonial science studies perspectives. Throughout, we will consider how both global and local cultural transformations have shaped the emergence of this multidisciplinary field of study. To understand the complexity of global health, students will engage with a number of theoretical and ethnographic texts while questioning its stability and coherence as a self-same object given its interdisciplinary character. In doing so, we will explore the ways in which diverse sets of interests converge to constitute as well as contest the ever-shifting boundaries of global health.",

    "course_description" : "This course engages critical masculinity studies through an anthropological lens that connects concepts and practices of manhood with politics and statecraft, particularly through exploration of the connection between masculinity and coercion by violence. We begin with an assumption that masculinities (plural) are culturally and historically imagined and defined. Rather than considering masculinity as simply a way of \"being\", we approach issues of manhood through modes of \"doing\", which are mutable, negotiable and often quite fragile. Examining masculinity as a culturally inflected process, as life experience and expectation, and as routinized practice allows us to explore its relationship with politics and governance in news ways that compel going beyond simple truisms like \"it's a man's world\". In addition to ethnographic and analytical texts, we will also incorporate into the discussion representations of masculinity in film, including popular/Hollywood fiction, as well as documentary and ethnographic films. Our goal will be to deconstruct common ideas about manhood and to develop anthropological concepts of masculinity and gender more broadly in relation to contemporary politics.",

    "course_description" : "Important legal and demographic changes in the U.S. in the 1960s enabled the production and public screening of homosexual pornography. These films were shown in theatres that no longer drew a mainstream audience, and a distinct West Coast and East Coast aesthetic emerged. The nascent commercial gay porn film industry developed in tension with the emergent gay liberation politics; new films were advertised in the gay press that critically examined the political and social value of this form of homosexual representation. This course will use the comparative case study of the reception of two films - Broadway choreography-turned-pornographer Wakefield Poole's Boys in the Sand (1971) and sex club owner and porn star Fred Hastead's L.A. Plays Itself (1972)- against the socio-political geography of New York and Los Angeles. Students will develop skills in: 1) the critical analysis of non-mainstream film and 2) the use of the alternative press as an historical archive. The discussion will be informed by concepts related to: sex and the built environment; the role of public space in development of sexual community; and the role of alternative media in the production of imagined community. The last weeks of the course will consider how current web-based pornography continues or alters aspects of the tradition of renegade sexual imaginaries and spaces.",

After providing the basic principles of evolutionary biology, the course will examine the development of sexual anatomy and physiology. How is sex determined? How is orgasm achieved? Why do girls and boys develop sexually at different ages? The role of ecology and social life in shaping human mating patterns will be evaluated through the use of ethnographies and cross-cultural materials on a variety of human cultures. Does everybody have sex the way we do? Why marry? Are there biological bases for love? Why do we experience jealousy? Fianlly, topics relevant to human sexuality today will be discussed, such as recreational sex, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases. Examples are drawn primarily from traditional and modern human societies; data from studies of nonhuman primates are also considered.",

    "course_description" : "The object of this course is to analyze narratives of adultery from Shakespeare to the present and to develop a vocabulary for thinking critically about the literary conventions and social values that inform them. Many of the themes (of desire, transgression, suspicion, discovery) at the heart of these stories also lie at the core of many modern narratives. Is there anything special, we will ask, about the case of adultery--once called \"a crime which contains within itself all others\"? What might these stories teach us about the way we read in general? By supplementing classic literary accounts by Shakespeare, Pushkin, Flaubert, Chekhov, and Proust with films and with critical analyses, we will analyze the possibilities and limitations of the different genres and forms under discussion, including novels, films, short stories, and theatre. What can these forms show us (or not show us)about desire, gender, family and social obligation? Through supplementary readings and class discussions, we will apply a range of critical approaches to place these narratives of adultery in a social and literary context, including formal analyses of narrative and style, feminist criticism, Marxist and sociological analyses of the family, and psychoanalytic understandings of desire and family.",

All texts will be in translation from Yiddish and Hebrew, or in English. Through a variety of genres--devotional literature, memoir, fiction, and poetry -- we will study women's roles and selves, the relation of women and men, and the interaction between Jewish texts and women's lives. The legacy of women in Yiddish devotional literature will serve as background for our reading of modern Jewish fiction & poetry from the past century. The course is devided into five segments. The first presents a case study of the Matriarchs Rachel and Leah, as they are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, in rabbinic commentary, in pre-modern prayers, and in modern poems. We then examine a modern novel that recasts the story of Dinah, Leah's daughter. Next we turn to the seventeenth century Glikl of Hamel, the first Jewish woman memoirist. The third segment focuses on devotional literature for and by women. In the fourth segment, we read modern women poets in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. The course concludes with a fifth segment on fiction and a memoir written by women in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English.",

There have been popular social scientific theories since the early 19th century, when the craze spread for interpreting individuals' character by feeling the bumps on their heads. But popular social science is really a 20th century phenomenon. And popular culture influenced academic research. Our coverage cannot be comprehensive. We have insufficient time to treat all human sciences equally. For example, there is enormous popular interest in paleoanthropology and archaeology, but we will not discuss these in class-although you mibht choose to write your research paper for the course on a spcific aspect of one of these disciplines.",

A tenth century courtier poses as woman writing the first woman's diary. Poets from Byron to Robert Lowell, through Ezra Pound to Li Po, have written as though, they were women, decrying their painful situations. Is something wrong with this picture, or is \"woman\" such a fascinating position from which to speak that writers can hardly help trying it on for size? In this course we will look at male literary impersonators of women, as well as women writers. Our questions will include who speaks in literature for prostitutes--whose bodies are in some sense the property of men--and what happens when women inhabit the bodies of other women via spirit possession. Readings will draw on the Japanese tradition, which is especially rich in such cases, and will also include Western and Chinese literature, anthropological work on possession, legal treatments of prostitution, and film. Participants will keep a reading journal and write a paper of their own choosing.",

We will consider the particular commercial and industrial structures and practices surrounding Indian cinema, exploring the ways in which it is produced, circulated, and avidly consumed. We will examine the ways the Indian cinema accounts for nationality, religion, migration, and gender, and consider themes such as the use and creation of public space, spectatorship and visuality.

Bearing in mind the social and medical legacies related to sexual and gender identities, this course will consider a range of historical and contemporary topics which speak to the intersection of bioethical dilemmas on medicine, sexuality and gender identity, including: the gay adolescent, the intersex person, gay-conversion therapies, the prospect of gay gene studies, sex addiction, queer blood/organ donation policies, and the wake of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. Specifically, we will focus on literary sources (memoirs, diaries, and films) as well as non-literary accounts (medical texts, bioethical scholarship, and historical records) that explore the emotional and somatic aspects of matters related to sexuality, gender identity, and bioethics.",

    "course_description" : "Historians have argued that early novels helped shape public opinion on many controversial issues. And no subject was more often featured in novels than marriage. In the course of the 18th and the 19th centuries, at a time when marriage as an institution was being radically redefined, almost all the best known novels explored happy as well as unhappy unions, individuals who decided not to marry as well as those whose lives were destroyed by the institution. They showcased marriage in other words in ways certain to provoke debate. We will. We both survey the development of the modern novel from the 17th to the early 20th century and study the treatment of marriage in some of the greatest novels of all time. We will begin with novels from the French and English traditions, the national literatures in which the genre first took shape, in particular Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons, Austen's Persuasion, Fronte's Jane Eyre, Flaubert'sMadame Bovary. We will then turn to works from other European traditions such as Goethe's Elective Affinities and Tolstoy's Ann Karenina. We will begin the course by discussing the novel often referred to as the first modern novel, The Princess de Cleves, an ideal beginning for this course, since it was also the first novel centered on an exploration of questions central to the debate about marriage for over two centuries - everything from the question of whether one should marry for love or for social position to the question of adultery.

How do cross-cultural and/or transnational influences manifest themselves (e.g. the influence of the Latin American \"testimonio\" form)?

Has that tradition been so dominant for so long that women's voices on stage are still a novelty? This course focuses on a wide range of plays and performances by and about women; the work we read (and view) will evidence artistic attempts to represent women's lives, experiences and perspectives on the stage. Among the issues encountered and examined in these works are the roles of love, sexuality, friendship, career, community, marriage, motherhood, family, and feminism in women's lives - as well as the economic and political position(s) of women in society. The course will also offer contextual background on feminist theatre history, theory, and literature, the diverse (and divergent) creative efforts of female artists to use live performance as a means of creating social and political change.",

A variety of sources are employed to introduce students from any field focused on human behavior and interaction to classical notions of social gerontology and current scholarly inquiry in gerontology. Field work in the tradition of thick description creates a mechanism to engage students in newly gerontological understandings of their life worlds and daily interactions. Weekly field work, observing aspects of age and representations of aging and being old in every day experiences forms, is juxtaposed against close critical readings of classical works in social gerontology and current research literature as well as viewings of film and readings of popular literature as the basis for student analysis. Student participation in the seminar demands careful scrutiny and critical synthesis of disparate intellectual, cultural, and social perspectives using readings and field work and creation of oral and written arguments that extend understandings of the issues at hand in new and substantive ways. Emphasis is placed on analysis of field work and literature through a series of media reports and a final term paper.",

Primary documents and other readings focus on the history of sexual ideology and regulation; popular culture and changing sexual practices; the emergence of distinct sexual identity and communities; the politics of sexuality; and the relationship between sexual and other forms of social difference, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, and class. Topics include many themes with continuing relevance to contemporary public debate: among them, sexual representation and censorship, sexual violence, adolescent sexuality, the politics of reproduction, gay and lesbian sexualities and sexually transmitted diseases.",

French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots, even love stories, co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example, Montesquieu's \"Lettres Persanes,\" \"Contes\" by Voltaire, Diderot's \"Le Neveu De Rameau\"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works, most notably Laclos' \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses,\" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion, we will be asking ourselves why and how, for the only time in the history of the genre, the novel could have been, in large part and for most of the century, partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.",

    "course_description" : "Families serve as the basic building blocks of societies. Besides helping to distribute economic resources within a society, families reflect societies' values, norms, tensions and power dynamics through their structure. Furthermore, changes in the family's values, functions and structures mirror changes in women's roles and experiences, both inside and outside the home. Finally, families also serve as the repository for memories from generation to generation. In this course, we will explore some central debates and issues in the history of the family by focusing on case studies from England, France, Germany, and the United States from the medieval through the modern periods. How are families created and dissolved over time, and how did changes in these practices come about? How did people make the decision to get married, and how important were affective ties and material considerations in this process? How did past societies treat their children, and did love for children increase over time? Which people, inside and outside families, exerted power over family members? How did political and economic developments influence families' structure, function, and ideology? What do the changing structure and purpose of families in the West tell us about changes in the role of the individual and the relationship between public and private in the West? What do recent family histories tell us about the relationship between the past and the present, between individuals and ancestors, at the end of the twentieth century? Class requirements will include participation in class discussion, in-class presentations, two short papers, and a 15-20 page paper based on primary sources. Class readings will draw on works from women' studies, historical anthropology, social history, legal history, material culture, sociology, and literature, and will include both primary and secondary sources.",

    "course_description" : "From the 15th century through the 18th century, social tensions erupted in Europe and the colonies in the witch craze, a period when intense cultural concern over witchcraft was expressed through religious treatises and sermons, popular literature like pamphlets and broadsides, legal accusations, trials, and, in some cases, executions. Although scholars argue vehemently about the total number of people executed during the witch-hunts, their importance in understanding early modern beliefs and responses to social tensions is clear. In this class, we will explore historians' understandings of the causes underlying this cultural phenomenon. With special attention to gender, social position,and religious belief, we will join academic debates about the causes of these persecutions. We will also read some primary sources from the medieval through the early modern periods, including trial transcripts, sermons, and pamphlets. Were women the main target of witchcraft accusations and executions, and if so, was misogyny their most important cause? What role did sexual norms and beliefs have in the way that accusations were framed? Were there different patterns of accusation and executions across time and region, and if so, what social and cultural factors might explain them?",

We will focus special attention on the following questions: To what extent are sexual identities constructed by different cultures, rather than simply being determined biologically? What influence do social, economic, and political conditions have on social constructions of sexuality? How have different societies used sexual norms to mark \"natural\" practices from \"deviant\" ones, and how are these norms connected to societies' power structures? We will explore case studies from Classical Greece through the contemporary United States. Our readings will explore topics such as medieval and modern views of the body, gender, sexuality, and science; prostitutes in medieval and Victorian England; same-sex relationships from classical Greece to medieval Europe to the contemporary United States; expectations for sexuality within and outside marriage; hermaphrodites; and sexual deviants, among others. Students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions, and to complete short response papers and a longer research paper.",

However, the existence of three pregnant queens Mary Tudor, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth I inescapably belied this central principle of social order. How did men and women of the period reconcile themselves to female rule, or did they? How did queens construct their public personae in order to maintain their power? What portrayals of ruling women were employed by queens'opponents? How do political ideologists, conflicting religious beliefs, and the pressure of dynastic struggle effect the question of female rule?",

In this course, we will read twentieth century novels, plays stories and poems (as well as some nonliterary theoretical works on gender) that show the family as a whole, albeit a fragmented whole. We will read stories by the Irish writers William Trevor and Edna O'Brien who show marriage in various stages of decay, as well as two short novels by the American Jane Smiley whose family survives their crises. We'll look at the relationship of neighborhood and family through stories by the African-American writers John Edgar Wideman and Toni Cade Bambara. Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Saleman\" and poems from Life Studies by Robert Lowell will let us examine family through the lens of America's obsession with success. Finally, we'll look at families with traditional homes, through Barbara Kingsolver's \"The Bean Trees\" and Marilynne Robinson's \"Housekeeping.\" Several of the works on the list have been made into excellent films, and we will watch at least two. Brief weekly response papers will encourage all to participate in discussion. There will be a final comparative paper, and no exam.",

Open to graduate and advanced undergraduate students, the workshop is a response to Amy Gutmann's call for interdisciplinary cooperation across the University and to the Department of Anthropology's commitment to developing public interest research and practice as a disciplinary theme. Rooted in the rubric of public interest social science, the course focuses on: 1) merging problem solving with theory and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice, racial harmony, equality, and human rights; and 2) engaging in public debate on human issues to make research results accessible to a broader audience. The workshop brings in guest speakers and will incorporate original ethnographic research to merge theory with action. Students are encouraged to apply the framing model to a public interest research and action topic of their choice. This is an academically-based-community-service (ABCS) course that partners directly with Penn's Netter Center Community Partnerships.",

We shall begin with the foundations of the \"courtly\" lyric tradition, reading the \"trobairitz\" (female troubadours). Next we shall turn to early Italian texts in which woman is the object of a male gaze. We shall consider both the classical \"high\" style that idolizes woman (Petrarch) and programmatic departures from it (Dante's \"Stony Rhymes,\" satirical dialogues, and humorous misogyny). Our point of arrival will be the Petrarchan poetesses of 16th-century Europe, with an emphasis on the Italians (Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa, Laura Battiferra degli Ammannati). What were the literary and philosophical traditions that shaped notions of female identity? How do women establish their own textual space when appropriating a genre that had been the vehicle for a masculine first-person voice? How do the images of women as scripted by men, or staged through male cross-voicing, differ from those in poetry written by women? What are problems and issues in constructing a national history of women poets? Course conducted in English, with texts available both in English and in the original. Undergraduates by permission. Requirements: class participation; a final oral presentation on a woman poet of the student's choice, and a term paper of not more than 20 pp. or a take-home final.",

This course will be grounded on a range of early modern literary authors for whom gendered constructs are of central concern (Sidney, Spenser, Jonson, Wroth, Lanyer, Cavendish, Hutchinson, Marvell, Milton), and we will be particularly focused on the relations among their formal properties, conceptual stances, and historical contexts. We will be equally interested in talking about how we can read these texts through the lens of the evolution of gender studies over the past few decades. Accordingly, we will look at a selection of critical theory (Marx and Engels, Freud, Lacan, Derrida, and Foucalt), second wave feminism (Beauvoir, Brownmiller, MacKinnon, Rubin, Kristeva, Gilbertand Gubar, among others), and more recent debates about gender, race, power, sexuality, and \"women's studies\" in the academy (Sedgwick, Butler, Wiegman, Berland, Warner, Chow, Brown, for instance). In addition, we will read some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century tracts on women, sexuality, and domestic relations, and, finally, a range of modern literary critics who share our interest in gender, literature, and history.",
