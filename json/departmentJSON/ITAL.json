    "course_description" : "This course will involve close study of the two major narrative works to emerge from medieval Florence. We will take advantage of the study-abroad experience to relate our readings closely to the city and region in which we are living, with visits to neighborhoods and monuments important to the authors or illustrative of the cultural forces that shaped their texts, as well as to the Casa di Dante in central Florence, and the residence of Boccaccio in the Tuscan hill-town of Certaldo. The classes will be dedicated to in-depth interpretation of Dante's \"Inferno\", of Boccaccio's \"Decameron\", and the relationship between their vastly different, yet kindred views of the human condition. The course will be given in English. This course may be taken for Italian language credit provided students do reading and writing assignments in Italian. It may also be taken for graduate credit, but additional work and meetings with instructors will be required.",

    "course_description" : "Italian 201 will focus on a recent movie by Italian director Tullio Giordana, La meglio gioventu(2002), which will be used as a point of departure to explore contemporary Italian culture following its development since the 1960s. Another recent movie, Mio fratello e figlio unico (2007), will be viewed and analyzed at the conclusion of the course as compared to La meglio gioventu. Pertinent literary texts, newspaper articles, as well as material in other media will complement the analysis of the film and allow an in-depth discussion of the most important topics. The cultural material explored in the course will be also used as a basis for a review of the most difficult grammar structures, with an emphasis on those necessary to express opinion and formulate hypothesis. Audiovisual materials and readings have been carefully chosen to develop student's comprehension and production in Italian, and to enable them to function in an academic setting in which competence at the advanced level is required. Class work will center primarily on conversation to improve students' fluency, vocabulary, and accuracy in speaking in the formal register. Homework will consist primarily, but not exclusively, of paragraph- length blog entries and 1.5-2 page compositions to improve students' ability to express themselves correctly and elegantly in written Italian. Additionally, students will be required to prepare two five 5 minute in-class or video presentation on one or parts of an assigned sequence, and on a social or cultural issue. In place of a final exam, students will write a final essay of 5-6 pages comparing La meglio gioventu to another recent Italian movie, Mio fratello e figlio unico, that will be introduced in class during the last week of the semester.",

Ventoux, Dante's Vita Nuova and Commedia, Boccaccio's Diana's Hunt, the Old French Vie de St. Alexis, and Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose). Discussion will focus on numerology as it relates to the medieval esthetic of order, the literary text as microcosmic counterpart to God's macrocosm, veiled meaning, and \"difficult\" poetics. We shall also consider the end of the tradition and what changes in science and culture brought about the disappearance of number symbolism in literature, except for a few moderns (e. g. Thomas Mann). Cross-listed with COML 548.",

Like Musil, Beckett, and others, Pirandello is conscious of thematizing a condition at the end of modernity generally marked by the dissolution of the subject, by \"anomalous\" social organization, and by antisysthetic thinking. In this course we examine what Pirandello's aesthetic contributes to this new tradition.",

These historical developments will be studied in comparison with parallel modern issues, such as Darwinism, separation of church and state, multicultural religious conflicts. Historical readings: Machiavelli's comic play Mandragola, the vitriolic polemic involving Martin Luther, Thomas More, and King Henry VII; Thomas Campanella's Utopian dialogue The City of the Sun, selections from the scientists Copernicus and Galileo, and from The History of the Council of Trent by the Venetian Paolo Sarpi. Modern texts: Osborne's Luther, Brecht's Galileo, and a classic Hollywood film Utopia, Frank Capra's Lost Horizon. In introductory and final units, we shall consider how 16th and 17th century poetry and visual arts mirrored their turbulent times, with an attention to the Petrarchan tradition (Vittoria Colonna, Marino) and stylistic changes in Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture from Renaissance to Mannerist to Baroque.",

Students will take futher steps towards being able to understand in depth and to contextualize authentic Italian documents. Texts like films, songs, and a variety of readings, will be used as windows on particular historical periods, cultural movements, political issues, and social customs. They will serve as a tool to investigate the many facets of Italian identity and, at the same time, as a way to prepare those students who will continue their study of Italian literature and culture in higher-level courses. Students are expected to participate willingly in conversations and all other class activities in order to perfect their oral and written ability to narrate, express opinion, hypothesize, and discuss a variety of topics quite accurately, using rich, appropriate vocabulary and grammar, and organizing paragraphs into well structured discourses, be they oral presentations, weekly compositions (2-2.5 pages) or the final essay (6-7 pages). To reach these goals, speaking, listening, reading and writing activities -- role plays, discussions, oral presentations, journals, grammar reviews -- will be based on audio-visual material and written texts provided by the instructor, and purchased and/or proposed by the students themselves, based on their independent explorations and research.",

We shall become acquainted not with the Italian Renaissance, but with a humbler Italy, the Italy that has determined the lives of millions of Italians so poor that they had to leave their country to try their fortunes in the United States and only now are making their voices heard. Readings will be a journey through first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants. Authors tell their stories and those of their illiterate parents or grandparents in memoires, autobiographies, and novels that witness their struggle, humiliation, and success from alienation to assimilation. The course will relate more broadly to issues of self and other, to the American immigrant experience of other ethnic groups in their process of Americanization. Authors include Tamburri, Barolini, Di Donato, Fante, Puzo, Mangione, Gambino, Prose, DeRosa, and Parini. Course offered in English, but if some students wish to practice the Italian language and use it in their written work, they are welcome and encouraged to do so.",
