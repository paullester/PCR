The course will also provide an introduction to the work of the Subaltern school historians who have engaged with such questions, and situate them within the wider field of South Asian historiography.",

The Planning Commission of India still exists but has lost much of its power. Many in the U.S. complain of American jobs draining off to India, call centers in India taking care of American customer complaints, American patient histories being documented in India, etc. At the same time, the U.S. government encourages highly trained Indians to be in the U.S. Students are expected to write four one-page response papers and one final paper. Twenty percent of the final grade will be based on class participation, 20 percent on the four response papers and 60 percent on the final paper.",

Arising in India inabout the 4th century B.C.E., this religion of world-transcendence quickly spread both towards the West and the East. From its earliest period, and in all its diverse incarnations, the figure of the founder of the religion, Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, has been a central one to all Buddhists. We will be reading a number of the most famous retellings of the Buddha's life, spanning well over a millennium, and considering how they reflect changing concerns and needs both of popular devotion and of learned theories (often competing ones) about the nature of enlightenment. We will look also at images from India, Nepal and Tibet that bring to life the Buddha's biography in stunning art.",

Each week, through a specific case study,framed by a few theoretical readings we will attempt to deepen and problematize the simple definition of globalization with which we start the course.

The urban discourses of the subcontinent were shaped by the cultural practices that emerged from the complex interaction between Persian and Indic cultural systems. Through the fourteenth century, the power of the Delhi sultinate declined and its political and religious constituencies became localized. This course will explore the complex cultural interactions between Delhi and the wider Dar al Islam on the one hand and with indigenous groups and local culture on the other. It will use both literary and material sources.",

What historical and scoio-cultural forces have made Indian democracy unique in the modern world, and distinctive from other South Asian nations that have faced similar colonial history? What conditions have enabled some South Asian nations to embrace democracy and prevented others from doing so? Using primary and secondary historical sources and ethnographic studies of everyday political life in South Asia, this course will focus on political organizations, movements, individuals, and practices that have played a decisive role in establishing and uniquely shaping democracy in South Asian subcontinent. We will pay close attention to the role of individual leaders and charismatic figures, including key women and minority leaders, and trace the development of \"dynasties\" within electoral politics. The course will also examine the history of public space as a forum for some of the distinctive practices that have most defined democracy in South Asia, including bandhs ( strikes), rasta rokos (road closures), processions, and other non-violent and sometimes violent forms of action. We will trace pre-colonial, colonial, and contemporary influences, and pay particular attention to the ideological role of Gandhian principles, including ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (passive resistance), in establishing popular forms of political practice that continue to be widely utilized in contemporary Indian and South Asian politics.",

The class focuses on \"globalization,\" the flows of people and culture that are increasing around the world. The class begins with the historical background for understanding the current period of globalization. We will look at the specific case of colonization in South Asia and emphasize its role in the rise of factories in both colonized and colonizing nations. We then consider the role of these factories in today's world as they employ women from the third world (sweatshops), and explore other issues related to gender and globalization and discuss scholarly responses to the changing world system. This class approach stresses that in order to understand women's lives in the non-western world, it is important to understand the on-going connections between the \"first world\" and between the United States and the rest of the world. The larger objectives of the course are: 1.To learn about the history and current conditions of South Asia, particularly as they affect women and gender. 2.To be able to identify relations between the \"first world\" and the \"third world through an understanding of elements of globalization",

When is religious conversion \"colonization of conciousness\"? Does spirit possession provide a means for subordinated or marginalized persons to \"speak back\" against the dominant? Do those who seek to subordinate their own will to God's (often transmitted through human authorities) \"have agency\"? Rather than seeking to answer these questions, we will use ethnographic and historical studies (e.g.Isabelle Nobakov, Saba Mahmood, Talal Asad, Rachel Fukton, Michel de Certeau, Webb Keane), as well as a few philosophical ones (Volosinov, MacIntyre, Strawson, Augustine), to think about the taken-for- granted the political-moral and scholarly framework, that generates such questions in the first place.",

This body of writing appropriates and reshapes the classic European Bildungsroman, but it also uses narrative traditions from South Asia in order to tell the story of the postcolonial nation, and to chart the contours of contemporary South Asian identity and sexuality. In this course, we will read novels, short stories and plays--some well known and others less so, some now considered 'classics' and others very recent, produced from within the Indian subcontinent as well as from the West. All of these speak of the excitement and trauma of growing up 'Indian'. Through them, we will discuss key features of the political and social upheavals of the Indian subcontinent, as well as the dynamics of the family, gender relations, sexual identities and cultural belonging. The course will include writings by Rudyard Kipling, Salman Rushdie, Bapsi Sidhwa, Amitav Ghosh, Mahasweta Devi, Hanif Kureishi, Anjana Appachana, Arundhati Roy, Meera Sanyal, Sara Suleri, Shyam Selvadurai, and Mahesh Dattani.",

However, the majority of the population never converted to Islam, and since independence in 1947 Islam--its interpretation, realization, and influence--has been a major factor underlying many difficult political issues. This has been true not only in the largest country, India, where Muslims form 12% (unevenly distributed) of the population, but in Bangladesh and Pakistan where non-Muslims are relatively insignificant minorities. This course explores the realities and the perceptions related to Muslim identities and the Islamic heritage in the Subcontinent, and sets it in global context by comparison with other parts of the world which share various aspects of the South Asian experience. The course will conclude with an assessment of the larger significance--social, economic and political, as well as cultural--of Islam in South Asia today.",

The class focuses on \"globalization,\" the flows of people and culture that are increasing around the world. The class begins with the historical background for understanding the current period of globalization. We will look at the specific case of colonization in South-Asia and emphasize on its role in the rise of factories in both the colonized and colonizing nations. We then consider the role of these factories in today's world as they employ women from the third world (sweatshops), and explore other issues related to gender and globalization and discuss scholarly responses to the changing world system. This class approach stresses that in order to understand women's lives in the non-western world, it is important to understand the on-going connections between the \"first world\" and between the United States and the rest of the world. The larger objectives of the course are: 1.To learn about the history and current conditions of South Asia, , particularly as they affect women and gender. 2.To be able to identify relations between the \"first world\" and the \"third wo rld through an understanding of elements of globalization (such as mass media and cultural productions). 3.To understand ways that colonialism, Westernization affects gender systems systems and the formation of women's social movements that respond to these forces in the South Asian context. 4.4.To offer through the lens of gender, a framework to understand the the connected effects of globalization on national politics, economics and social issues in contemporary South Asia.",

We will be reading a number of the most famous retellings of the Buddha's life, spanning well over a millennium, and considering how they reflect changing concerns and needs both of popular devotion and of learned theories (often competing ones) about the nature of enlightenment.

Over a period of nearly two millennia from its origins in the fourth or fifth century BC Buddhism played an important role in Indian religious practice and philosophical thought, as well as in politics and in the court, and it is often not realized that Buddhists made important contributions to the arts, literature, and the sciences as well. In addition to studying key works writtenby Indian Buddhists, we will read accounts of Chinese and Tibetan pilgrims to what they saw as the holy land of the founder of their faith.",

It also introduces the historiography of colonialism in South Asia, the different, often contradictory, stories that aretold about the nature and impact of colonial rule, and about the process of achieving independence from colonial rule. By focusing on a small sect of specific questions , students will learn to analyze primary and secondary historical sources, recognize the major schools of South Asian (particularly Indian),history writing, and identify how these various approaches discuss the past differently. Major questions for this course will include the following: (1) How was Britain, a tiny European island nation, able to come to dominate nearly the entire South Asian subcontinent? (2) Did British rule help India develop technologically and economically or did it cause India to de-industrialize and become more impoverished? (3) Were the widespread Indian rebellions of 1857 and 1858 a Sepoy Mutiny, the first war of Indian independence, or something else? ( 4) Did British colonialism shape and transform knowledge and identities within South Asia, including the caste system, Hinduism, and conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, or did these all exist in their present forms prior to colonialism?",

We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.",

This millenium is arguably one of the most transformative in South Asia's history, a period when many of its most distinctive social and cultural features evolved. The course will provide both an overview of the period as well as an introduction to major interpretations and types of sources (textual, visual, and archaeological). The focus throughout the course will be on the heterogeneous development of states, societies and cultures with special attention to long-term processes of transformation. One set of themes explored will be largely social and economic, focusing on the development of agrarian and peasant societies, aristocracies and intellectuals, as well as the role of mercantile, pastoralist, nomadic and forest-living groups. Another set of themes will explore cultural transformation, including the development, transformation and interaction of religious practices, the emergence of cosmopolitan and regional literary cultures, and the rise of distinctive urban, courtly, and rural world views. Special themes of discussion may include violence and manners, material cultures, religious conflict, devotional religion and gender relations.",

Since its inception in the 1910s, Indian popular cinema has straddled the great rural/urban divide in ways that in recent times have largely bifurcated popular cinema into the 'massy' and the 'classy'. Through a historical overview of films (both 'Bollywood' and other regional popular cinema) from silent, colonial, and post-colonial eras into the contemporary era of globalization, this course will look at the diverse cinematic representations of the village and the city, often as counterpoints reinforcing the recurring, if problematic, divides between tradition and modernity, mass and class, local and global. We will also examine how these diverse portrayals of the rural/urban divide on the Indian celluloid depict shifting understandings of nationalism, modernity, migration, criminality, censorship, globalization and consumerism as well as of caste, class, gender and religion. By familiarizing students with filmic narratives such as song-and-dance sequences, masala-style potpourri of genres, melodrama, etc., this course will also sensitize them to how the particular uses of these narrative conventions reflect and shape the social and cultural contexts in which these films are produced, circulated and consumed.",

These varied, imaginiative and wide ranging projects ranged from attempts to change the diet and dress of the nation to changing its economic and agricultural practices. Since these projects straddle the space marked off by the twin ideologies of nationalism and modernism, we will begin the seminar by exploring some of the relevant theories of both these ideologies. We will then proceed to develop and deepen that theoretical understanding through a number of case studies.",

Some of these ideas have come from emigration and immigration, some from invasion and some have simply sprung up. We will begin by looking at the Indian materiality in language, rituals, spatial analyses of towns, weights and measures. We will go on to the rituals and materiality of the Indo-Aryans, the political thought that evolved, to the scientific thinking and technological innovations, the Grand Mughals, the European colonial period, Nehru's independent India, the liberalized economy of India in 1991 and end with the present.",

This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of: Muslim institutions and spaces in pre-colonial South Asia, the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Islam, and the development of Urdu as an Islamic idiom. The second and main part of this course introduces students to academic literature concerning sophisticated encounters between the Muslim elite in north India and modern political and technological developments. The intimate interactions of the 'Mullah' and the 'Englishman' from the 19th to 20th century will thus be revealed to students. This part focuses upon, on the one hand, the role of Islam and pious Muslims in the colonial army, and on the other hand, Muslim initiatives to educate an Islamic 'modernism', 'traditionalism', 'fundamentalism' and 'Sufism', and appropriate print technologies for the creation of public spheres. Students will be introduced to historical scholarship revelatory of how these Muslim pedagogies and print initiatives were based upon sophisticated transcultural networks and exchange. In the third part of this course, students will be encouraged to engage with contemporary literature on South Asian Muslim political philosophy and nationalism, and the transcultural intellectual exchanges that produced key Muslim political ideologies.",

In Part I we examine the key historical antecednets to the rise of the so-called 'gunpowder' empires from c.1500 to c.1800. Part II of the course surveys the major gunpowder empires individually, beginning with the Ottomans, followed by the Safavids and then the Mughals. Finally, in Part III we more explicitly pursue a comparative perspective by looking at cross-cutting themes, including early state building, adminitrative cenralization, the structure of production and exchange, urbanism and courtly culture, gender, and the management of religio-cultural difference.",

South Asians in the U.S. will be divided thematically covering the topics of ethnicity, marriage, gender, religion, and pop culture.

    "course_description" : "Just the thought of almost 4 billion people rising out of poverty and a billion of them them expected to be millionaires is exhilarating and daunting. But there is no single blue print for economic development, at least not yet. Given its natural resources, ideology, politics and cultural sensibilities, each nation experiments with various strategies of development. All we know at this point is that land reform, education, good governance, health, an access to technology and an open economy contribute heavily towards development. This course will offer the history and implications of socio-economic development in Asia. We will look at the theories of development, their applications and the results on the various nations in China and South Asia. Managing development is also a critical issue. We will examine if social development is a linear outcome of economic growth. We will also analyze topics such as democracy, equity, education, micro-finance, poverty, religions and value systems, sustainable development, intellectual property rights, issues of public health including pandemics and the effect of a rising Asia on the Asian Diaspora, especially on the Asian Americans. In the course of a socio- economic development, China and India are bidding for a world seat. Though India and Pakistan talk of an attitudinal shift towards each other they still have armies facing one another across Kashmir. Bangladesh has severe economic and political problems that affect its policies regarding India and Pakistan. And, each of these nations have internal problems of their own. There are no pre-requisite courses for this class but we will require an open mind, a liking for critical analysis and developmental issues.",

    "course_description" : "Over fifty percent of the worlds population now lives in cities. Neoliberlism-the ideology and accompanying policies and practices that champion the shifting of political decision making from the public sector to the private sector - has been widely recognized as having shown dramatic growth worldwide since the 1970s. It has also been widely regarded as a product of globalization. This course traces the history of neo-liberalism in global context with particular attention to neoliberalism's relationship to cities, and exam the role that urban growth has played in spurring neoliberal policies and practices. It asks how policy makers, voters, and private interest worldwide have responded to the growth of urban poverty and slums, challenges withing urban public education, unequal resource distribution, environmental pressures experienced within urban sanitation and waste disposal systems, and increased demands for municipal services like water, electricity, and transport infrastructers, and examined the rise of public-private partnerships, gated communities, initiatives to privatized education and municipal services, and efforts to relocate slum-dwellers and beautify cities as explicit strategies for attracting \"global capital\". The course also asks how the recent rise of neoliberal policies and practices differs from earlier market-driven and private sector led forms of political governance. The British and Dutch East India Companies are two famous examples of joint stock companies that assumed administrative and political roles over their colonies. How did the rise of these colonial relationships differ from current neoliberal shifts. Readings will draw heavily from ethnographic and urban studies, scholarship on South Asia, as well as Latin America, South Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North America, exploring what each of these specific contexts has to teach us more generally about the relationship between urbanization, global capitalism, public and private sectors, and political processes and decision making.",

Pakistan and India came into being as nation-states in moments of great national trauma: historians have long argued over the process that led up to Partition, and we will study some of these debates, but for the most part we will examine novels, short stories, poetry, and some films to think about the impact of Partition and Independence on communities and individuals in South Asia. In doing so, we will recognize the continuing role played by these events and experiences in shaping the cultural, social, and political realities of contemporary South Asia. We will also learn about the crucial role played by literary and creative texts in making available to us the full dimensions of human tragedy, especially those precipitated when the imperatives of nation-formation redefine the lives of individuals or of sub-national communities.",

This course will particularly consider how extant, published sources reveal how religion in 19th and 20th century cosmopolitan port cities and islands: was centered upon holy men and women or spiritual beings, and intricately connected to modern economic, political and technological developments in the India Ocean. This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students will be introduced, on the one hand, to the scholarship on the port cities or islands of, and religions or religious networks in, the modern Indian Ocean. On the other hand, to anthroplogical, historical and literary works on Muslim saints, Christian missionaries and Saiva gods in the Indian Ocean. In the second and main section of this course, students will be introduced to contemporary academic literature pertaining to the inter-linkages between itinerant miracle-workers, missionaries, 'gods' and devotional cults, and economic, political and technological developments in the Indian Ocean. As well as works that explore European institutions, barracks, plantations, cells and asylums, and and steam travel being steeped in customary religion, carnivals, ecstacy, madness and miracle stories. Here, students will be encouraged to consider ways in which a study of religion and religious economies of modern Indian Ocean port cities can be recovered through extracts from a range of anthropological, literary and historical sources. In the third part of this course, students will be encouraged to engage with the question of whether the religion of devotional cults preoccupied with the powers of Muslim, Saiva, Christian, and Sikh miracle-workers, missionaries and 'gods' in cosmopolitan port cities, was a distinct product of circulations within the Indian Ocean.",

Through the fourteenth century, the power of the Delhi sultinate declined and its political and religious constituencies became localized. This course will explore the complex cultural interactions between Delhi and the wider Dar al Islam on the one hand and with indigenous groups and local culture on the other.

By engaging with theories of art, literature and music from the Indic and Indo-Persian traditions, we will attempt to better understand what happens in an aesthetic experience. A central concern will be thinking about how much any aesthetic tradition, be it South Asian or other, is rooted in the particular epistemic and cultural values of the society that produced it; we will therefore explore how ideas from the South Asian tradition can help us to understand not only South Asian material, but art in other societies as well, including our own. Examples and case studies will therefore occasionally be taken from art, performance and literature of the Americas, Europe, Africa and East Asia in addition to South Asia. Class discussion, small group work, and individual presentations will be regular features of the class. Two sessions will include performances by, and discussions with, performing artists including dancers, musicians, and singers. We will also make one visit to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",

Specifically, the course will introduce students to the diverse roles that popular religions have come to play on specific South Asian societies. By stepping outside the theological domain of religions, the course will sensitise students to the complex and multifacted entanglements of religious behaviour with other domains of social activity. In so doing, it will also familiarise the students with some of the major theoretical orientations pertaining to the crosscuttings of popular religion with certain other categories of the 'social', i.e. caste, class, gender, etc.",

This course willexplore the manner in which the Indian Ocean has played both roles throughout history, and how the nature of those divisions and connections has changed over time from the ancient to the modern world. We will reconstruct the intertwined mercantile, religious and kinship networks that spanned the Indian Ocean world, across the Middle East, East Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and China, illuminating the histories of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, while also considering the role of successive imperial political formations, from Rome to Britain. Throughout the semester we will seek to understand the Indian Ocean through the people who lived and worked in its milieu - from consuls and militaty commanders, to traders, brokers, sailers, prisoners and slaves. Course materials will draw on a variety of discuplines (anthroplogy, archaeology, material culture, religious studies) to construct the cultural, economic, and environmental history of the Indian Ocean.",

The Subaltern Studies collective that emergedin South Asia in the 1980s and 1990s is now recognized as one of the more important historical interventions in recent years. Subaltern Studies' historiographic writing has questioned dominant nationalist narratives by that they represent only the history of elites. The objective of this course is to draw attention to differing understandings of colonialism and nationalism by laying out the perspectives of \"subalterns\"-untouchables, tribals, peasants, workers, women and other marginalized groups. In addition, \"subaltern\" perspectives will also be applied to the study of themes like democracy, politics, modernity, development, cities, the environment, and the mass media in South Asia. The interventions made by the Subaltern Studies collective will be situated in relationship to developments in European historiography, with special attention to the unique departures of this new school. Debates within and critiques of the collective's approach will also be examined. A background in South Asian history or culture is not a prerequisite; however some exposure to historiography or current debates in cultural theory is desirable",

    "course_description" : "Film history and cultural criticism once approached melodrama as a failed and lowbrow form of tragedy characterized by excessive rhetoric,one-dimensional characterizations, and schematized moral polarizations. Scholarship of the last few decades, however, exhibits a newfound interest in the genre or mode, particularly within psychoanalytic, Marxist, feminist, and postcolonial frameworks. This course surveys the body of that scholarship with a focus on these last two. If as Peter Brooks argues, melodrama is a mode for the modern age, how does a sense of the postcolonial modern come to be visualized and articulated in cinema through melodrama? In this course, we will focus on temporality and change, two markers of modernity, to consider how melodrama, particularly in the South Asian context, alternatively centers on and addresses women by emphasizing the body as a key node or site of signification. How does the melodramatic focus on the body and excess allow us to reconsider and perhaps productively put into crisis concepts that have served to fix femininity such as stardom, fantasy, the male gaze, and the female voice? We will contextualize our discussion within the larger history of the representation of women in melodramatic film by considering Hollywood racial melodramas and film from other postcolonial and national cinemas.",

In this course, we will read novels, short stories and plays--some well known and others less so, some now considered 'classics' and others very recent, produced from within the Indian subcontinent as well as from the West. All of these speak of the excitement and trauma of growing up 'Indian'. Through them, we will discuss key features of the political and social upheavals of the Indian subcontinent, as well as the dynamics of the family, gender relations, sexual identities and cultural belonging. The course will include writings by Rudyard Kipling, Salman Rushdie, Bapsi Sidhwa, Amitav Ghosh, Mahasweta Devi, Hanif Kureishi, Anjana Appachana, Arundhati Roy, Meera Sayal, Sara Suleri, Shyam Selvadurai, and Mahesh Dattani.",

Why are nations routinely imagined as women, and imperial conquest expressed in terms of sexual mastery? Are 'race' and 'gender' analogous? What are the differences between the way in which women and sexuality are used in the imperial imagination on the one hand, and anti-colonial, nationalist writing on the other? We will address these questions via a range of literary texts ranging from Shakespeare's The Tempest to recent postcolonial fiction (by Tayib Salih, Ama Ata Aidoo and Arundhati Roy, among others) as well as key theoretical and historical writings in the field.",

Central to class discussions will be the question of what constitutes a languager literature, and consequently what relation those concepts can have to nation in a multilingual state such as India.

By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times, we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions, artistic, architectural, and musical traditions, textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as \"Just-War,\" Women's Rights and Abortion. While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara, Japan or Vietnam, Laos.",

In doing so, the course emphasizes specific texts and essays related to South Asian literature, literary theory, and aesthetics from the past two millenia as case studies in order to: a) supplement students' knowledge of South Asian cultural production, b) frame social and historical questions related to art and aesthetics in contexts that have been otherwise under-explored, and c) to inspire debate about the extent to which analytical models and approaches developed within a given cultural setting are translatable to literary materials produced elsewhere. Students will develop their own projects, workshop what they have already begun, or explore new directions for studying literature and literary culture. Comparative approaches with other literary traditions are welcome and no background in South Asian languages or history is required.",

The resulting alignments and alliances drew the subcontinent into the center of cold war rivalries. The last part of the course focuses on the changing security environment after the cold war, the rise of India and China as competitors for influence; and problems posed by persisting mutual resentment and distrust in India and the United States, despite recognition on both sides of the need to cooperate and avoid China's domination of Asia.",

How have the desires to possess and consume particular commodities shaped cultures and the course of modern history? This class introduces students to the cultural history of the modern world through an interdisciplinary analysis of connections between East and West, South and North. Following the circulation of commodities and the development of modern capitalism, the course examines the impact of global exchange on interactions and relationships between regions, nations, cultures, and peoples and the influences on cultural practices and meanings. The role of slavery and labor migrations, colonial and imperial relations, and struggles for economic and political independence are also considered. From the role of spices in the formation of European joint stock companies circa 1600 to the contemporary cocaine trade, the course's use of both original primary sources and secondary readings written by historians and anthropologists will enable particular attention to the ways that global trade has impacted social, cultural, and political formations and practices throughout the world.",

In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of: Muslim institutions and spaces in pre-colonial South Asia, the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Islam, and the development of Urdu as an Islamic idiom. The second and main part of this course introduces students to academic literature concerning sophisticated encounters between the Muslim elite in north India and modern political and technological developments. The intimate interactions of the 'Mullah' and the 'Englishman' from the 19th to 20th century will thus be revealed to students. This part focuses upon, on the one hand, the role of Islam and pious Muslims in the colonial army, and on the other hand, Muslim initiatives to educate an Islamic 'modernism', 'traditionalism', 'fundamentalism' and 'Sufism', and appropriate print technologies for the creation of public spheres. Students will be introduced to historical scholarship revelatory of how these Muslim pedagogies and print initiatives were based upon sophisticated transcultural networks and exchange. In the third part of this course, students will be encouraged to engage with contemporary literature on South Asian Muslim political philosophy and nationalism, and the transcultural intellectual exchanges that produced key Muslim political ideologies.",

Readings are interdisciplinary and include works of history, anthropology, sociology, medical research, literature, political science, geography, and human rights advocacy. As students develop final projects on topics of their choice, we will spend time throughout the semester discussing tactics for research and writing.",

We explore historical case studies of Hindu-Muslim relations and the formation of religious identities, together with the ways in which these identities have been contested and constructed in modern discourses on religion and politics. Through the course of the seminar, we interrogate the analytical categories of conquest, iconoclasm, conversion, and syncretism, around which several current debates on Hindu-Muslim relations have been framed. Topics discussed include: the interactions of Sufi, Bhakti and Yogic traditions, Mughal religious cultures; the impact of colonialism on religious identities and sectarian relations; the partition of India and creation of Pakistan, and nationalist historiographies.",

It is also designed to train students to read texts critically and to produce coherent arguments about them. The course is organized in five sections: (1) Ancient Pilgrims; (2) The World of the Indian Ocean; (3) Courtly Travelers; (4) Colonial Encounters; and (5) Real and Imagined Places.We will begin with ancient travelers such as the Greeks and Fa-Hsien, then look at the marvelous accounts of Arab sailors and merchantsin the India and China Seas, medieval Islamic travelers and European accounts of voyages to the Indies. We will then examine the writings of colonial wanderers in search of the Indian picturesque. We will end with accounts of the rediscovery of real and imagined places, looking at some post-colonial encounters.",

Considered in the context of the contemporary societies of the developing world - with their bursting populations, pervasive land hunger, and ongoing tug of war between the urban and the agrarian - the answer may seem to go without saying. The question's extreme simplicity of form, however, should not conceal the great complexity it harbors, especially when examined relative toto the histories of the non-West. Is there a difference between property and the right to property? Are rights, themselves, inherently proprietary? What is the relationship between the logic of property and the logic of commodification? Is property simply the reality of control over things in the world or is it a system for representing how control over such things in the world is organized, parsed, and reckoned with? Is there something inherently Eurocentric about calling al such conceptual systems by the name of 'property'? In this course we will consider historical scholarship on the control and disposition of landed wealth in South and neighboring regions/borderlands with which its history has been significantly tied in the period from early modernity to the era of national independence. In so doing, we will also ground the historical works we examine in a consideration of varied theoretical perspectives on the nature of property drawn from law, economics, philosophy, and social theory.",

    "course_description" : "The comparative study of South Asian politics begins with many antecedent questions. What are the reasons why a strong national political identity in the Indian subcontinent was no consolidated and territorial boundaries defined until the advent of the British Raj? Alternatively, given major regional diversities, why did the subcontinent not become differentiated into a large number of national states on the model of Europe? To what extent was the movement toward a unified territorial state weakened by colonial policies that recast social groups in terms of new pan-Indian categories based on caste and religious identities? What factors led to the partition of the subcontinent at the time of independence on the basis of religion, and what consequences did partition have for the strategies adopted by each state to develop an overarching national identity and universal principles of legitimate state power? Although the greater part of the course will address these questions by analyzing the social and political dynamics of democracy in India, they are equally relevant for understanding the difficulties encountered by Pakistan in defining a core identity and a stable form of government.",

    "course_description" : "This course is an intensive survey of the rich variety of Islamic intellectual, literary and cultural phenomena subsumed under the term Sufism. Sufi philosophies, liturgical practices, and social organizations have been a major part of the Islamic tradition in all historical periods, and Sufism has also served as a primary muse behind Islamic aesthetic expression in poetry, music, and the visual arts. In this course, we will explore the various significations of Sufism by addressing both the world of ideas and socio-cultural practices. The course is divided into three broad sections: central themes and concepts going back to the earliest individuals who identified themselves as Sufis; Sufi metaphysics and epistemology as exemplified in the work of Ibn al-'Arabi and his school, and literary expressions as exemplified in the epic poem Layla and Majnun by Nizami, The Conference of the Birds by Attar, and in the life and poetry of Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi. In studying this material, we will be concerned equally with establishing common patterns and seeing how being a Sufi has meant different things to various people over the course of history.",

Topics include bureaucracy and the state; economic liberalization and political transformations; land, law, and eminent domain; capital, banking, and credit; kinship, community, and approaches to the concept of identity (including caste, nation, language, and religion); and the environment, politics, and urban and rural ecologies. Particular emphasis will be placed on the ways in which recent ethnographic and historical monographs have positioned their interventions in relation to broader debates and scholarship, both within South Asia scholarship and more generally. Particular attention will be devoted to the different material forms through which publics have been imagined, addressed, and brought into being within specific historical moments and contexts (including each student's own areas of research interest). Although the coursewill pay particular attention to the unpacking and application of these concepts, debates, and issues as they pertain to South Asia, readings will be drawn from a range of authors and would be of use to students studying similar issues in other parts of the world.",

The class focuses on \"globalization,\" the flows of people and culture that are increasing around the world. The class begins with the historical background for understanding the current period of globalization. We will look at the specific case of colonization in South-Asia and emphasize on its role in the rise of factories in both the colonized and colonizing nations. We then consider the role of these factories in today's world as they employ women from the third world (sweatshops), and explore other issues related to gender and globalization and discuss scholarly responses to the changing world system. This class approach stresses that in order to understand women's lives in the non-western world, it is important to understand the on-going connections between the \"first world\" and between the United States and the rest of the world. The larger objectives of the course are: 1.To learn about the history and current conditions of South Asia, , particularly as they affect women and gender. 2.To be able to identify relations between the \"first world\" and the \"third world through an understanding of elements of globalization (such as mass media and cultural productions). 3.To understand ways that colonialism, Westernization affects gender systems systems and the formation of women's social movements that respond to these forces in the South Asian context. 4.4.To offer through the lens of gender, a framework to understand the the connected effects of globalization on national politics, economics and social issues in contemporary South Asia.",

This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of: Muslim institutions and spaces in pre-colonial South Asia, the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Islam, and the development of Urdu as an Islamic idiom. The second and main part of this course introduces students to academic literature concerning sophisticated encounters between the Muslim elite in north India and modern political and technological developments. The intimate interactions of the 'Mullah' and the 'Englishman' from the 19th to 20th century will thus be revealed to students. This part focuses upon, on the one hand, the role of Islam and pious Muslims in the colonial army, and on the other hand, Muslim initiatives to educate an Islamic 'modernism', 'traditionalism', 'fundamentalism' and 'Sufism', and appropriate print technologies for the creation of public spheres. Students will be introduced to historical scholarship revelatory of how these Muslim pedagogies and print initiatives were based upon sophisticated transcultural networks and exchange. In the third part of this course, students will be encouraged to engage with contemporary literature on South Asian Muslim political philosophy and nationalism, and the transcultural intellectual exchanges that produced key Muslim political ideologies.",

Dissent is a key word in our world today--from the Arab Spring to the American Fall, we have seen expressions of political disobedience and protest around the world. It is more urgent than ever to consider what dissent might mean, what shapes it has taken historically, what connection might exist between it and literature, and what futures are possible. We will read key critical and theoretical work alongside some powerful, tender and controversial writings and films (largely but not exclusively produced in the postcolonial world), to inquire into the politics and poetics of governance and dissent. Students are invited to make connections with other historical and geographical contexts, and explore the different forms of dissent individual, collective, urban, rural, nationalist, pan-nationalist, religious, marxist, or feminist, to name but a few. We will pay special attention to different performances of dissent at a popular, mass or individual level.

The movement of people, ideas and technologies did not always result in conflict, but more commonly created culturally hybrid worlds. The ability to adapt, innovate, improvise and absorb while retaining core ideals is best expressed in the material form of architecture.

Throughout, we explore ontologies of sound; sonic occurrences in religious structures, public processions, and pilgrimage sites; the construction of religion and ritual as ideas forg ed through colonial encounter and modern scholarship on religion; the politics of sacred sounds in today's public spaces and contemporary media, such as television and online; and the surprising fluidity between popular and sacred musical genres.",

    "course_description" : "This undergraduate level course introduces students to Sufism in modern South Asia, with a particluar focus on how Muslim 'mystics' and their 'mystical' methods interacted with modernity, colonialism, technological developments and globalization. This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of the theological and historical background of the dominant expression of Islam that came to be identified as 'Sufism' or 'Islamic mysticism', the historical development of Sufi institutions and spaces in South Asia, and the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Sufism. The second and main part of this course introduces studetns to a range of anthropological and historical works that are revelatory about how Sufi in modern South Asia were and remain intimately connected to modern political and technological developments. Providing students with an overview of Sufi re-enchantments of modernity from the 19th to 21st century, this section of the course focuses upon Sufi movements and masters who perpetuated or defended customary Islam through sophisticated appropriations of technologies and print networks, and negotiations with non-Muslim rulers and societies. Moreover, students will be introduced to anthropological and historical scholarship on religious worlds in modern South Asia that were and remain steeped in 'customary Islam' and Sufi performances and interpretations of Islam. These sources reveal how 'mystical' methods of performing Islam through ecstasy and spiritual restoration, and interpretations of dreams and visions, have regularly interacted with contemporaneous technologies. The third part of this course introduces students to the globalization of South Asian Sufism in North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. Herein, students will be encouraged to engage with anthropological and literary works pertaining to itinerant South Asian Sufi masters and their devotional cults, and introduced to active South Asian Sufi centers in Philadelphia.",

    "course_description" : "This undergraduate-level course introduces students to the multi-religious complexion of South Asia as a region, with a particular focus upon key religious traditions and the resemblences and interactions between them. This course is divided into two parts. In the first part of this course, students are introduced to key religious traditions of South Asia, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Sikhism. Students will be encouraged to survey academic works pertaining to, on the one hand, the literature, doctrines, cosmologies, rituals and histories of, and prominent places of worship in, the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim and Sikh religious traditions. On the other hand, the development of South Asia into a distinctive space and spiritual 'homeland' for multi-religious communities. Whilst the first part of the course focuses upon religious traditions autonomously, the subsequent section of the course is thematic and encourages students to make comparisons, and discover sophisticated relationships and dynamic interactions between religious traditions in South Asia. Students are introduced to scholarly writings that are revelatory of the materiality of religious traditions in pre-modern and modern South Asia; everyday forms of piety in South Asia; gender positions in religious traditions; encounters of religious traditions with European colonialism; and, perceptions of the 'other' in pre-modern religious traditions. Herein, students will find multiple sites of resemblances or differences, and cultural negotiations, engagements and contests, within religious traditions in South Asia.",

The course will include the reading of primary sources relevant to understanding these changes a well as highlight both modern and premodern traditions of their interpretation. It will also consider and assess some of the key interpretive ideas in the study of Hinduism, including, Sanskritization, Great and Little Traditions, cult formation, regional and popular religious movements, and canon formation.
