In the first half of the semester, the major theories of public policy making will be explored. In the second halfof the semester, the actors in the policy making process will be identified and placed in the context of the policy making models identified earlier in the course. Students will compare and contrast existing theoretical models and through writing assignments will apply the theory to current policy events. The course is designed to complement an internship in the public policy arena, providing context and background that will enrich the internship experience.",
