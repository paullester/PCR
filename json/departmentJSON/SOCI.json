The course begins by asking where social problems come from. The main sociological perspectives of Marx, Weber and Durkheim are developed in connection with the issues of inequality, social conflict and community. We then turn to the social construction of social problems by examining how various issues become defined as social problems. This involves a consideration of the role of the media, social experts and social movements. The last section of the course considers how social problems are addressed. Here we discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of government programs and regulations versus market-based approached. We also discuss the role of philanthropy and volunteerism. Finally, we consider the risk of unanticipated consequences of reforms. Along the way, we will consider a variety of social issues and social problems, including poverty, immigration, crime, global warming, and education.",

This class will consider pressing social concerns that China must struggle to address as it continues down the path of market reforms. Using topical problems to illustrate broader issues of social inequality along lines of gender, ethnicity, residence status, and poverty status, we will consider questions such as the following: How are women and men faring differently in China's new labor market and workplaces? Are rural peasants and the emerging underclass of urban laid-off workers being left behind by market transition? How are minorities faring in China's transition? How does the emerging digital divide play into the dichotomies of east-west and urban-rural in China? What is the plight of millions of \"floaters\" migrating into China's cities, with minimal legal rights and protections? Can China's rapidly-changing public health system handle emerging diseases such as SARS and AIDS? How has the one-child policy affected women, children, and society in China? Who are the \"missing girls\" of China, and what are the social implications of their disappearance? How was the welfare of children and adolescents changed with market reforms?

Scholars, corporations, advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era. These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society, but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola, Nike and Hollywood films), and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF, World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets). Moreover, we will study globalization in the context of cities because, given their centrality to globalization processes, it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities, we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space, giving rise to new financial districts, international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light, contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America, Asia and Africa.",

While there is agreement on fundeamental pricinples as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, differences in interpretation remain. A platform for convergence requires the engagement of a number of constituencies, in particular, state and inter-state entities, corporations, civil society and individuals, as well as the mutual reinforcement of their rights and duties.

Variation in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder.

It will examine elite families. It will also look at elite education. There will be a unit on the financial industry, the 2008 debacle, and the failure of the government to regulate this important industry. We will also study the influence of race by comparing the black upper-middle-class with white upper-middle-class families.Thus, we will also look at the power of elites in a number of spheres. Finally, we will also read theoretical perspectives including the work of C. Wright Molls, Marx, and Bourdieu.

The course will stress the importance of understanding Latinos within the overall system of race and ethnic relations in the U.S., as well as in comparison with previous immigration flows, particularly from Europe. We will pay particular attention to the economic impact of Latio immigration on both the U.S. receiving and Latin American sending communities, and the efficacy and future possililities of U.S. immigration policy. Within all of these diverse topics, we will stress the heterogeneity of the Latino population according to national origin groups (i.e. Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Latinos), as well as generational differences between immigrants and the native born.",

It applies the concepts and methods of anthropology, history, political economy and sociology to the analysis and interpretation of what is actually happening in the course of the semester that relates to the progress of globalization. We focus on a series of questions not only about what is happening but about the growing awareness of it and the consequences of the increasing awareness. In answering these questions we distinguish between active campaigns to cover the world (e.g. Christian and Muslim proselytism, free-trade agreements, democratization) and the unplanned diffusion of new ways of organizing trade, capital flows, tourism and remote interaction via the Internet. The body of the course deals with particular dimensions of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of each. The overall approach is historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of the economic, political and cultural development of various parts of the modern world. The course is taught collaboratively by an anthropologist, an historian, and a sociologist, offeringthe opportunity to compare and contrast distinct disciplinary approaches. It seeks to develop a general social-science-based theoretical understanding of the various historical dimensions of globalization: economic, political, social and cultural.",

In order to do so we will make use of social science research, along with philosophical treaties, legislation, and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth.

Evidence on how society measures crime and the role that each major criminal justice agency plays in controlling crime is examined from the perspective of crime victims, police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, prison officials, probation officers and parole board members. Using the model of social policy evaluation, the course asks students to consider how the results of criminal justice could be more effectively delivered to reduce the social and economic costs of crime.",

Emphasis will be placed on (1) how and when law can be an instrument for social change, and (2) how and when social change can cause legal change. In the assessment of this relationship, emphasis will be on the laws of the United States. However, laws of other countries and international law relevant to civil liberties, economic, social and political progress will be studied. Throughout the course, discussions will include legal controversies relevanat to social change such as issues of race, gender and the law. Other issues relevanat to State-Building and development will discussed. A comparative framework will be used in the analysis of this interdependent relationship between law and social change.",

Overall, then, it seems increasingly difficult for us to have an adequate description and understanding of the world we live in, and correspondingly, how we should act within it.

After a comprehensive overview of the structures of labor and housing markets and of nondiscriminatory reasons (that is, the cumulative effects of past discrimination and/or experiences) for the existence of group differentials in employment, wages and residential locations, various theories ofthe sources of current discrimination are reviewed and evaluated. Actual government policies and alternatives policies are evaluated in light of both the empirical evidence on group differences and the alternative theories of discrimination.",

For the Fall 2010 semester, the topic is the following: Nail salons, nursing, hair care stores, pizza shops, parking garages, donut shops, and taxis represent niche industries for different ethnic groups across the racial and national spectrum. We will explore how and why particular groups have concentrated in certain industries, and how processes related to globalization, such as diplomatic ties, the globalization of banking, foreign investment, trade, labor recruitment, transnational economic activities, and immigration contribute to their concentration. We will learn scholarly explanations for why ethnic groups concentrate in key industries by engaging literature that spans across the fields of scoiology, urban studies, business, and migration. We will examine case studies of several ethnic groups and draw from examples in Philadelphia. This course will introduce students to a range of data and sources that are used by those studying and working in economic and urban development, finance, business, and immigration and will emphasize analysis of data and critical thinking skills.",

Class readings, discussions, and visits to Philadelphia's immigrant neighborhoods explore themes including labor markets, housing experiences, political mobilization, civil society, cultural preservation, and the built environment. The first half of the course surveys migration and community formation among a broad range of ethnic groups in different parts of the city and suburbs, mainly through history, sociology, and geography; the second half focuses on specific policy and community and economic development initiatives. Ultimately, the class aims to provide students with 1) a broad knowledge of immigration and its impacts on cities and regions; 2) an in-depth understanding of urban policies and institutions working on immigration in U.S. cities; and 3) familiarity with community and economic development strategies for migrant and receiving communities.",

It then considers what influences journalism, and how recent changes in the organisation and practice of journalism are affecting the welfare of society. This is followed by an equivalent examination of what influences television drama and film. The implications of recent developments are explored through two case studies: first, /Sex and the City/, examined partly in relation to debates within feminism and post-feminism, and second, the/Sopranos/, assessed in relation to competing interpretations of cultural value. The course's conspectus is then broadened to take account of the way in which different countries organise their media systems, and the underlying objectives and assumptions that inform national media policies. This leads, in turn, to a discussion of media globalisation, cultural imperialism' and international media regulation; and of the policy choices posed by the rise of new media.",

Organizing campaings have played a central role in US history, most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material, case study reviews, guest speaker presentations, inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.",

But the series of social, economic, and technological developments that underlie what is often called the \"Information Revolution\" include much more than just the computer. In this course, we explore the history of informtion technology and its role in contemporary society. We will explore both the technologies themselves--from telephones to computers to video games--as well as their larger social, economic and political context. To understand the roots of these ideas we look at the pre-history of the computer, at the idea of the \"post industrial\" or \"information society,\" at parallels with earlier technolgies and at broad currents in the development of American society.",

It affects every aspect of people's lives, from their intimate relationships to their participation in work, family, government, and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system. Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior, power,and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender, in contrast, emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained, with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.",

Most of these are low-income, unmarried, cohabiting parents. The goal of the course is for each student to use these two data sets, and the analytic techniques and literature covered in the course, to write a paper that can be submitted for publication. The spring will also include lots of tips on how to construct a publishable paper. Students should only enroll in this course if they plan to take the spring sequel course as well.",

This course will explore the way researchers, activists, politicians and others in different eras have made sense of these changes and patterna and have responded to them. The course is historical and sociological. At the same time that we examine evidence and theories about the way poverty, affluence, and other social factors influence individual and population health, we will try to understand how social and historical forces have shaped how health and disease have been understood and categorized. In examing our current obesity \"epidemic,\" for example, we will not only consider evidence and claims made about the causal role of market forces and changes in the built environment, but ask why (besides the fact that we are heavier) obesity has become such a visible and important medical and public health issue in the U.S. today.",

Its main emphasis will be on the history of health care in America from the U.S.Civil War to Obama care. The primary objective of the course will be to consider why the U.S., until very recently, remained one of the only industrialized nations to have a private, non-nationalized health care system. Some of the themes addressed include: private health insurance(such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield), industrial health and workmen's compensation, the welfare state (in Europe, Canada, and the U.S.), women's health, especially maternal and infant care programs, Medicare/Medicaid, the Clinton Health Plan of 1993, injured soldiers and the Veterans Administration.",

Whatever this field might be, it is more often than not actively produced through a range of conflicting ethical commitments of multiple expert cultures, social movements and laypersons. This course explores critical themes in the historical and sociocultural study of global health. Students will engage a number of disciplinary perspectives within the social sciences including the history, sociology, and anthropology of science, and we will pay particular attention to feminist, queer, and postcolonial science studies perspectives. Throughout, we will consider how both global and local cultural transformations have shaped the emergence of this multidisciplinary field of study. To understand the complexity of global health, students will engage with a number of theoretical and ethnographic texts while questioning its stability and coherence as a self-same object given its interdisciplinary character. In doing so, we will explore the ways in which diverse sets of interests converge to constitute as well as contest the ever-shifting boundaries of global health.",

    "course_description" : "How do American cities grow? Studies of urban transformation have focused on anchor institutions, the growth model of big business-generated employment, and \"creative class\" gentrification. After decades of decline, many major cities like Philadelphia are seeing gains in population again, as well as new commercial activity and street life, spurred by the influx of new immigrant communities. Yet few scholars have asked: What role do immigrants play in the current revival of the American metropolis? In this Social Science Studio course, 16 students will work collaboratively as in a design studio to conduct research that can answer this important social-scientific question. Students will work on independent projects that engage multiple methods and fields to produce new types of knowledge. They will be introduced to multiple methods drawn from architecture, planning, anthropology and political science, including mapping, interviewing, fieldnotesnotes, socio-economic surveys, sketching, photography and web design to develop independent projects. No prior knowledge is required but students with experience in GIS, STATA, photography, drawing or web design are encouraged to apply.",

So the historical biographers write about the way they remembered and visualize the past, and not about the way that it happened. We will take Du Bois's biography in his own words and interrogate his narrative with the visual narratives of his life and influence produced by others. \"Visualizing W.E.B Du Bois\" focuses on photographic, film, and video representations intended to present some aspect of Du Bois's reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction or maintaining a historical record. Such projects include photos, materials originally shot on film stock, and digital images that can be either displayed in a book or magazine, and moving images made into a film or video for a TV show or released for screening in cinemas, or other broadcast mediums like YouTube and Vimeo.",
