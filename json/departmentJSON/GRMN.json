    "course_description" : "How can war be depicted in lyric poetry? How does poetry bring war into view? (Think of the ways in which Tolstoy and Hemingway wrote about war!) What attitudes can be adopted toward war? These are the main questions we will discuss in this class. Starting from Hegel's concept of lyric poetry, we will look at the German lyric as it confronts the phenomenon of war. Of course, the experience of war is an important part of German culture. Responses have spanned from glorification to condemnation. In this course our main focus will be on the poetry of Andreas Gryphius through Bertolt Brecht, from the Thirty-Years-War to WWII. We will analyze and interpret these poems against their historical context and listen to musical settings (by Robert Schumann, Friedrich Silcher, Hanns Eisler, Norbert Schulze). We will not only see how Leni Riefenstahl uses a German war song in Triumph des Willens, but also Michael Curtiz in Casablanca and Tennesse Williams in The Night of the Iguana; and we will hear Marlene Dietrich sing \"Lili Marlen.\" We will also consult classical texts of the theory of war (e.g. Clausewitz and Schmitt) to complete the picture. Thus our view will range from the Baroque to the Modern: a glance which will not only bring war into view, but also offer an outline of German lyric poetry and insights into German history.",

Characterized by a unique intelligence, marked by a magnificent range of beauty in appearance and song, subject to astonishing imperatives of instinct--birds interact with us across a vast gulf of evolutionary differentiation. If paleontologists are right, we encounter in birds the direct descendents of the dinosaurs. In this course we will discusss classics of avian culture in literature, art and film, including: Aristophanes'comedy The Birds and the eleventh-century Persian book of poems known as Conference of Birds; the bird paintings of Dutch Golden Age artist Melchior de Hondecoeter; classics of animal psychology such as Konrad Lorenz's Year of the Greylag Goose and Irene Pepperberg's experiments with her African Grey Parrot Alex; and cinematic works such as Hitchcock's famous film The Birds (based on a Daphne du Maurier story), Birdman of Alcatraz, Winged Migration, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill, as well as a special section on birds in cartoons and animation. We will encounter moments of impertinent interspecies intimacy, blank ornihophobic terror (Hitchcock!), and breathless admiration. Our focus throughout will be on the relationships forged and imagined between humans and birds.",

    "course_description" : "Kant's \"Critique of Judgment\" (1790) is the third and last of his three Critiques. It is of major importance for an understanding of Kant's philosophy as a whole in at least three respects. 1) Being the latest of the three Critiques it gives the ultimate view Kant has with regard to his 'critical system' in its entirety. This view is presented explicitly both in the unpublished First Introduction and the published version of the Introduction to the third Critique. 2) It contains as its first part his theory of the judgment of taste, i.e. his aesthetic theory. This theory is of interest not just because of its immense influence on subsequent theories of the beautiful but also because of the way it tries to solve the problem of the universal validity of judgments that do not have the statue of judgments of cognition. 3) The third Critique presents in its second part Kant's attempt to integrate living organisms as objects of knowledge into his epistemological framework. It thus comprises his philosophy of biology and his discussion of the status and the function of teleological explanations in science. Though the seminar is meant to deal with all these aspects it can -- depending on the interests of the participants -- focus with different intensity on each of these.",

But what causes a book to blow its cover? In this course we will consider a range of specific censorship cases in the west since the invention of the printed book to the present day. We will consider the role of various censorship authorities (both religious and secular) and grapple with the timely question about whether censorship is ever justified in building a better society. Case studies will focus on many well-known figures (such as Martin Luther, John Milton, Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe, Karl Marx, and Salman Rushdie) as well as lesser-known authors, particularly Anonymous (who may have chosen to conceal her identity to avoid pursuit by the Censor).",

In the context of today's debates about the expansion of Europe and the so-called war on terrorism, it is a concept which demands further historical investigation. On the basis of travel narratives and other texts, we will explore this key term, noting how it has been insistently (re)formulated since the beginnings of modernity. We will also investigate several theoretical models which can help us to think through the cultural encounters documented in the primary works. A series of fundamental questions will accompany us through the semester: Where is the East? Is the East a homogenous place eliciting either fear or wonder? Who lives in the East and how are the \"customs and manners\" of its inhabitants comprehended? What happens to a German in the East? And, vice versa, what happens to an \"Oriental\" in Germany? Is the East only in the East? Can one also find the East in Germany?",

Parallels were often explained through the cultural or even biographical background of the writers. This plagiarism debate reveals how Turkish-German literature is frequently assessed by focusing on the cultural and personal biographies of the authors or on issues of (cultural) representation rather than looking at the text as a work of fiction. In this course, we will explore to what extent autobiographical elements in Turkish-German literature give reason for such an approach, discuss the advantages and limits of analyzing these texts within their cultural and autobiographical contexts and consider alternative approaches in order to analyze textual resemblances, such as concepts of literary relationship (e.g. Kristeva,Bloom,Genette). In addition to the above mentioned novels by Zaimoglu and Ozdamar, we will have a close look at Selim Ozdogans novel \"Die Tochter des Schmieds\".",

Its aesthetic form revolutionized musical theater, prepared the grounds for musical modernity and avant-garde, foreshadowed Hollywood's film music, and left many traces in literature and the visual arts. At the same time, its ideological claims had profound impact on Germany's self-understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries, founded the Wagner-cult in Bayreuth, provided the political establishment with a doubtful frame of reference, and are deeply burdened with their reception. Wagner attempted to create nothing less than a modern myth. The aim of this seminar is to penetrate into this myth, into its \"ecstasy of lust and knowledge\" (Baudelaire), with understanding and distance. We will discuss texts about Wagner by, inter alia, Thomas Mann, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Friedrich Nietzsche, Theodor W. Adorno--and, of course, the works and writings of Wagner himself.",

    "course_description" : "In the wake of the Second World War, Germany had to address a crushing national guilt with spiritual tools that seemed incommensurable to the task. Despite Adorno's dictum that poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, many writers looked to literature for ways to work through issues of guilt and responsibility. This course will address the adaptation of pre-modern literature in the late twentieth century as a \"fresh\" way of approaching the question of sin and atonement. The guiding issue throughout the semester will be the relationship between literature and ethics and the appropriateness of literature in coming to terms with moral catastrophe. Additional questions will be: What is the difference between pre-modern conceptions of sin and atonement and modern ones? What makes pre-modern literature an attractive lens for contemporary writers? What are the methods of adaptation and do various media provide different possibilities? The course will begin with a brief introduction to the question of collective German guilt and the use of literature in \"Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung.\" We will continue with several adaptations of the Faust myth (e.g. Klaus Mann's Mephisto, Else Lasker-Schueler's IchundIch) and the Grail legend (the Thule Society, Syberberg's Parsifal) as examples of meditations on postwar national guilt, before considering some later twentieth-century examples (Peter Handke's Das Spiel vom Fragen and his support of Slobodan Milosovec). The course will conclude with the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church-the most pressing issue of global collective guilt which sees a German, Pope Benedict XVL, standing at the head.",

    "course_description" : "\"Languages are not strangers to one another,\" writes the great critic and translator Walter Benjamin. Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depend upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts. With a diverse group of readings--autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthrology, and literary theory--this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture. What does it mean to translate? How do we read a text in translation? What does it mean to live between two languages? Who is a translator? What are different kinds of literary and cultural translation? what are their principles and theories? Their assumptions and practices? Their effects on and implications for the individual and the society?",

Can the Holocaust be a topic even if it is not mentioned at all in the text? How do comedy and the Holocaust topic relate to each other? Can history and philosophy be part of a literary treatment of the Holocaust? Influential texts and films from major literatures and cultures in the world will be our starting point.",

The present course will offer a survey of the history of Prussia, beginning with the seventeenth century, and the unification of the small towns of Berlin and koelln to establish a new capital for this country. It will tell the story of Berlin's rising political prominence in the eighteenth century, its transformation into an industrial city in the late nineteenth century, its rise to metropolis in the early twentieth century, its history during the Third Reich, and the post-war cold war period. The course will conclude its historical survey with a consideration of Berlin's position as a capital in reunified Germany. The historical survey will be supplemented by a study of Berlin's urban structre, its significant architecture from the eighteenth century (i.e. Schinkel) to the nineteenth (new worker's housing, garden suburbs) and twentieth centuries (Bauhaus, Speer designs, postwar rebuilding, GDR housing projects, post-unification building boom). In addition, we wil ready literary texts about the city, and consider the visual art and music created in and about Berlin. Indeed, Berlin will be a specific example to explore German history and cultural life of the last 300 years. The course will be interdisciplinary with the fields of German Studies, history, history of art, and urban studies. It is also designed as a preparation for undergraduage students who are considering spending a junior semester with the Penn Abroad Program in Berlin.",

In addition, we will take account of important technological, social, and economic developments marking modernity, focusing our attention on the ways in which they intersect and interact with cultural production, cultural politics, and perception itself. Readings will include key texts by representative authors, including Benjamin, Kafka, Barthes, Kracauer, Brecht, Adorno, Baudelaire, Eliot, Woolf, and others.

    "course_description" : "Celebrity-scholar, literary stylist, cultural monument, pagan hero, self-made man, homosexual codeword, murder victim: despite his humble origins in Prussia, Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-68) enjoyed a meteoric career as an archaeologist and art historian in Rome and came to define a century. His developmental view of culture and his celebration of Greek art challenged prevailing ideas and established new paradigms. The seminar will pay careful attention to Winckelmann's most important writings, including \"Reflections on the Imitation of the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks\" (1755), the \"History of Ancient Art\" (1764), and his famous descriptions of statues such as the Belvedere Apollo and Laocoon group, while keeping in mind the context of mid eighteenth century Rome. The lasting impact of Winckelmann's Greek subject matter, his aestetic theory, and his literary style will be traced, with readings ranging from Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Walter Peter, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Thomas Mann, to the troubling reincarnation of Winckelmann's statues in Leni Riefenstahl's Fascist Olympic films. Finally, Winckelmann's central role in the field of queer studies will be explored, via a consideration of his representation of the male body beautiful and of his own status as a codeword for homosexual desire.",

It was seen above all as a radically new literary form, a novelty. At the same time as the novel was becoming , many other kinds of novelties such as coffee and chocolate first became part of the European landscape. At the same moment the fashion industry was born when high fashion was first marketed to a broad public. And perhaps the ultimate novelty in this story was the novel's gender bias: it was the only form in literary history to have been produced massively by women. This seminar will explore the ways in which histories of the novel and of contemporary novelties such as coffee and high fashion were intertwined. We will pay particular attention to another contemporary genre, the newspaper, whose rise in the early modern period was essential to the marketing of novelties. We will also focus on the process of translation by means of which the novel spread rapidly through England, France, and Germany.",

The European Union is now stronger than ever before, and on May 1, 2004 ten more countries joined the EU - the largest-ever expansion. Is the EU benefiting from this enlargement or does the arrival of so many new members drain money from the EU budget and slow down the EU decision-making? This course will provide an overview of the political and economic developments towards integration in post-war Europe, focusing on Germany's key role. Studying content-rich reading materials, it explores historic-political, social, economic and cultural issues that are urgent for Germany as well as the European community.

    "course_description" : "\"Languages are not strangers to one another,\" writes the great critic and translator Walter Benjamin. Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depends upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts. With a diverse group of readings, -- autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthropology, and literary theory -- this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture. What does it mean to translate? How do we read a text in translation? What does it mean to live between two languages? Who is a translator? What are different kinds of literary and cultural translation? What are their principles and theories? Their assumptions and practices? Their effects on and implications for the individual and the society?",

We will also read two Spielmannsepen which have as their central theme the international motif of the bridal quest, namely Sankt Oswald and Koenig Rother, and compare these works with the Nibelungenlied and Tristan, which themselves also involve the bridal quest as one of their principal structural elements. There is, however, a major and critical distinction between the traditional happy ending of the bridal quest epics and that of The Nibelungs and of Tristan and Isolde, for those two German works culminate in the total destruction and disintegration of entire peoples and values, or with the utter misery of the ideal couple. With our readings of the love poems of the French Troubadours and those of their German counterparts, the Minnesaenger, our final genre of medieval literature, we will not only discuss the ubiquitous and timeless love theme in all its variations, but also the socio-political implications of such poetry.",

At the same time, research has also focused on the rupture of narrative, the inability to find appropriate forms of telling, and the experience of a loss of words. The notion of trauma (Greek for \"wound\") may stand for such a rupture. Many kinds of narratives, most prominently the recollections of Holocaust survivors, are instances in which memories are invoked not only to come to terms with traumatic events, but also to inscribe trauma in various ways. In this seminar, we will read theoretical work on memory and trauma, discuss their implication for the study of literature, art, and culture, read select examples from Holocaust survivors' autobiographies (i.e. Primo Levi, EliWiesel), and discuss visual art (i.e. Boltanski, Kiefer) and film (i.e. Resnais, Lanzmann, Spielberg).",

They talked about the weather and had sex, they had to deal with cold, hunger, illness, epidemics and natural catastrophes. Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury, went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write. And fewer still managed to obtain some form of higher education in cathedral schools and nascent universities and became teachers themselves. Those eager to learn about other people and foreign customs traveled to distant places and brought back with them much knowledge and new ideas. The similarities, we will all agree, are striking. But what is of interest to us are the differences, the \"alterity\" (keyword) of the ways in which they carried out these actions and fulfilled their goals. This course concentrates on two very broad aspects of daily life in the Middle Ages (12 th - 16 th centuries). The first part, Erudition, focuses on the world in and around the University.

Contextualizing Marx within a tradition of radical thought regarding politics, religion, and sexuality, we will focus on the philosophical, political, and cultural origins and implications of his ideas. Our work will center on the question of how his writings seek to counter or exploit various tendencies of the time; how they align with the work of Nietzsche, Freud, and other radical thinkers to follow; and how they might continue to haunt us today. We will begin by discussing key works by Marx himself, examining ways in which he is both influenced by and appeals to many of the same fantasies, desires, and anxieties encoded in the literature, arts and intellectual currents of the time. In examining his legacy, we will focus on elaborations or challenges to his ideas, particularly within cultural criticism, postwar protest movements, and the cultural politics of the Cold War. In conclusion, we will turn to the question of Marxism or Post-Marxism today, asking what promise Marx's ideas might still hold in a world vastly different from his own.",

In the context of today's debates about the expansion of Europe and the so-called war on terrorism, it is a concept which demands further historical investigation. On the basis of travel narratives and other texts, we will explore this key term, noting how it has been insistently (re)formulated since the beginnings of modernity. We will also investigate several theoretical models which can help us to think through the cultural encounters documented in the primary works. A series of fundamental questions will accompany us through the semester: Where is the East? Is the East a homogenous place eliciting either fear or wonder? Who lives in the East and how are the \"customs and manners\" of its inhabitants comprehended? What happens to a German in the East? And, vice versa, what happens to an \"Oriental\" in Germany? Is the East only in the East? Can one also find the East in Germany?",

Alongside this Hollywood tradition of Jewish film, Yiddish film blossomed from independent producers between 1911 and 1939, and interpreted literary masterpieces, from Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" to Sholom Aleichem's \"Teyve the Dairyman,\" primarily for an immigrant, urban Jewish audience. In this course, we will study a number of films and their literary sources (in fiction and drama), focusing on English language and Yiddish films within the framework of three dilemmas of interpretation: a) the different ways we \"read\" literature and film, b) the various ways that the media of fiction, drama, and film \"translate\" Jewish culture, and c) how these translations of Jewish culture affect and are affected by their implied audience.",

Central to the class are the varied and creative answers to the long question about how to write a progressive literature.  Is the concept of a revolutionary literature useful today?  We begin by turning to the legacy of Plato's banishment of poets from the good state as well as Aristotle's spirited defense of poets Writers and readings may also include: pamphlets by Martin Luther, essays by Thomas Paine and Friedrich Schiller; Buechner's drama Woyzeck, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, Trotsky's Literature and Revolution, Mariano Azuela's novel of the Mexican Revolution, The Underdogs, plays by Bert Brecht (Mother Courage and Her Children).",

Bracing-and-often confrontational-dialogues between theoretical and political positions as varied as Deconstruction. New Historicism, Cultural Materialism, Feminism, Queer Theory, Minority Discourse Theory, Colonial and Post-colonial Studies and Cultural Studies have, in particular, altered disciplinary agendas and intellectual priorities for students embarking on the /professional / study of literature. In this course, we will study key texts, statements and debates that define these issues, and will work towards a broad knowledge of the complex rewriting of the project of literary studies in process today. The readiing list will keep in mind the Examination List in Comparative Literature-we will not work towards complete coverage but will ask how crucial contemporary theorists engage with the longer history and institutional practices of literary criticism. There will be no examinations. Students will make one class presentation, which will then be reworked into a paper (1200-1500 words) to be submitted one week after the presentation. A second paper will be an annotated bibliography on a theoretical issue or issues that a student wishes to explore further. The bibliography will be developed in consultation with the instructor; it will typically include three or four books and six to eight articles or their equivalent. The annotated bibliography will be prefaced by a five or six page introduction; the whole will add up to between 5000 and 6000 words of prose. Students will prepare \"position notes\" each week, which will either be posted on a weblog or circulated in class.",

As cinema enthusiasts, Goebbels and Hitler were among the first to realize the important ideological potential of film as a mass medium and saw to it that Germany remained a cinema powerhouse producing more than 1000 films during the Nazi era. This course explores the world of Nazi cinema ranging from infamous propaganda pieces such as The Triumph of the Will and The Eternal Jew to entertainments by important directors such as Pabst and Douglas Sirk. More than sixty years later, Nazi Cinema challenges us to grapple with issues of more subtle ideological insinuation than we might think.

In this course we will examine both the \"modernity\" of Nietzsche's thought and the ways in which his ideas have helped to define the very concept of Modernity (and, arguably, Postmodernity) itself. In exploring the origin and evolution of Nietzsche's key concepts, we will trace the ways in which his work has been variously revered or refuted, championed or co-opted, for more than a century. We will survey his broad influence on everything from philosophy and literature to music and art, theater and psychology, history and cultural theory, politics and popular culture. Further, we will ask how his ideas continue to challenge us today, though perhaps in unexpected ways. As we will see, Nietzsche wanted to teach us \"how to philosophize with a hammer.\"",

All texts will be in translation from Yiddish and Hebrew, or in English. Through a variety of genres--devotional literature, memoir, fiction, and poetry -- we will study women's roles and selves, the relation of women and men, and the interaction between Jewish texts and women's lives. The legacy of women in Yiddish devotional literature will serve as background for our reading of modern Jewish fiction & poetry from the past century. The course is devided into five segments. The first presents a case study of the Matriarchs Rachel and Leah, as they are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, in rabbinic commentary, in pre-modern prayers, and in modern poems. We then examine a modern novel that recasts the story of Dinah, Leah's daughter. Next we turn to the seventeenth century Glikl of Hamel, the first Jewish woman memoirist. The third segment focuses on devotional literature for and by women. In the fourth segment, we read modern women poets in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. The course concludes with a fifth segment on fiction and a memoir written by women in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. \"Jewish woman, who knows your life? In darkness you have come, in darkness do you go.\" J. L. Gordon (1890)",

This course will study his work, its cultural background, and its impact on us today. In the first part of the course, we will learn about Freud's life and the Viennese culture of his time. We will then move to a discussion of seminal texts, such as excerpts from his Interpretation of Dreams, case studies, as well as essays on psychoanalytic practice, human development, definitions of gender and sex, neuroses, and culture in general. In the final part of the course, we will discuss the impact of Freud's work. Guest lectureres from the medical field, history of science, psychology, and the humnities will offer insights into the reception of Freud's work, and its consequences for various fields of study and therapy.",

We will consider the various strategies for framing disability, as well as their consequences, in a range of twentieth-century plays, novels, memoirs, short stories, and films, including works by Helen Keller, Ken Kesey/Milos Forman, Kenzaburo Oe, Heiner Mueller, Terry Galloway, Friedrich Duerrenmatt, and Katharine Dunn, as well as read influential studies by David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder, Lennard Davis, Rosemarie Garland Thomson, and others.",

Proceeding chronologically, we will examine all of Nietzsche's major writings: from the early essays through the hopefulness of the 'free spirit' period, from the calculating genealogies to the inchoate and chaotic fragments of the posthumously published Will of Power, from the profoundly strange and terrifying Zarathustra to the fevered final works. Throughout the semester, students will be invited to consider Nietzsche's philosophical inheritances (from, for instance, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer) and influences (on Heidegger, Foucoult, Deleuze, Derrida and many others). Discussions in English, but students are invited to read texts in the original where appropriate.",

Jahrhundert herausbildet. Im Mittelpunkt solcher Kurzerzaehlungen stehen erotische Abenteuer und unerhoerte Begebenheiten, in denen eine kritische Situation durch originelles und mutiges Agieren der handelnden Personen geloest wird. Das Maere steht der Novelle nahe. Novellistisches Erzaehlen ist eine alte Erzaehlform, die in den orientalischen Raum zurueckreicht; wir kennen es vor allem durch die Maerchen von \"Tausendundeiner Nacht\". Es fand seinen Hoehepunkt waehrend der italienischen Fruehrenaissaince in Boccaccios \"Decamerone\" und muendete in die Gattung der Novelle. In der deutschen Literatur gehoert die Maerendichtung zu der mittelalterlichen Vorgeschichte dieser Gattung. Inwiefern sie eine eigene Gattung bildet, ist in der mediaevistischen Forschung umstritten. Der Kurs beschaeftigt sich mit den episch-didaktischen Kleindichtungen des Stricker (um 1220/30) und mit dem Typus der hoefischen Minnenovelle des Konrad von Wuerzburg (etwa 1230-1287), deren bekanntestes Beispiel dad \"Herzmaere\" darstellt. Wir werden die hoefische Liebe, die Maenner- und Frauenrollen, die mittelalterliche Ehe sowie die feudale Gesellschaftsordnung, ihre Verhaltensnormen und ihr dualistisches Weltbild in den Blick nehmen.",

This course investigates texts by contemporary \"German\" authors with diverse roots, who live in between countries, cultures, heritages,traditions and languages. All have either immigrated to or were born in Germany. Currently, each author lives and works in Germany, writing in German and in their respective \"mother tongue\". Each author differently questions issues of nationhood and nationality and challenges traditional notions of what it means to be \"German\" and living in today's Germany. Through the critical reading of their colorful prose, you deepen your understanding of the complexities of global citizenry and look into fixed categories of identity formation. In addition, you break open stereotypical imaginations of what German literature entails. The course has two particular areas of concentration: Turkey and the European Union. Germany and 20 years after reunification. Authors include Yoko Tawada, Feridun Zaimoglu, Hatice Aky?n und Fatih Akin, Julia Zeh (Ed.) und Ingo Schulze.",

But there have always been other encounters that forced people to distiguish themselves from an \"other\". Foremost, in order to define what is \"human\", the \"unhuman\" needed to be described. Initially, this meant distinguishing the human from the rest of nature. With the industrial revolution, the technological became a concern--machines as monsters. On a figurative level, we have the supernatural, ghosts, aliens, and cyborgs.

The first tear says: How nice to see children on the grass. The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass! The second tear makes kitsch kitsch.\" (Milan Kundera) Most of us can recognize bad taste as soon as we see it: Harlequin romances, Elvis on black velvet, lawn ornaments. But bad taste also has a history, and kitsch has been identified as a peculiarly modern invention related to capitalism and consumerism. Beginning with a discussion of taste in the eighteenth century (Hume, Kant), we will investigate under what conditions good taste can go bad, for example when it is the object of mass reproduction, and, on the other hand, why bad taste in recent times has increasingly been recuperated as an art form. Categories such as the cute, the sentimental, the miniature, kitsch, and camp will be explored. We will also ask what forms of ideological work have been done by this brand of aesthetics, for example in the connection between politics and kitsch, feminity and the low-brow, or camp and queer identity.",

We will begin with Heinrich Heine's satirical treatment of the romantic anachronisms of the early nineteenth century as a way to introduce our topic, but turn quickly to aspects of medieval revival between 1900 and 1950. During this time, an intense, consistent (and often overlooked) medieval impulse thoroughly permeates the development of German modernism. \"The Middle Ages\" becomes a popular source of images, themes, contents and religious feeling that manifest across the arts, and our course will survey the figures or types of works that convey \"the medieval\" in modernismthe modernist \"passion play\", the hagiographic biography, the mystical text that serves at the template for avant-garde poetics, modern contemplative poetry modeled on monastic prayer, expressionist painting of forgotten medieval saints, the filmic treatment of epic tales, the modern attempts to recuperate the past in medieval-style monuments. Some artists and authors include Rainer Maria Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Landauer, Ernst Kantorowitcz, Emil Nolde, Wilhelm Worringer, Hugo Ball. We will also survey contemporary theories that seek to interpret the social and political implications of medieval reception in the early twentieth century especially in relationship to the two world wars. Students will be invited to think about the local/national specificities of Germany's medieval revival, as well as how it relates to other European receptions of medieval themes, especially in France and England.",

    "course_description" : "At a time when contemporary culture is markedly engaged in a repudiation of secularism and a return to religious belief, it may be interesting to explore the Enlightenment as a mirror image and origin of our present situation. The Enlightenment has long been understood as a trans-European effort to counter, if not flatly reject religion, superstition, the church, and divinely instituted monarchy. Recent scholarship challenges this conception and urges us to think of the Enlightenment engagement with religion and the Bible as a productive encounter. Enlightenment thinkers and writers in Germany (including members of the Haskalah) presided over an explosion of biblical scholarship, exegesis, interpretation, theologizing, and literary adaptation. As Jonathan Sheehan argues, the Enlightenment did not reject the Bible--the Enlightenment changed it. Topics will include: pietism, gender, and subjectivity; theodicy; the Berlin Haskalah; anti-semitism; Spinozism and radical Enlightenment; sacred history and the origins of historicism; translation, interpretation and adaptation. Authors will include: Lessing, Mendelssohn, Klopstock, Herder, Goethe, Jung-Stilling, Kant, Moritz, and Maimon, as well as new scholarship by Sheehan, David Sorkin, Jeffrey Freedman, Jonathan Hess, and others. French and English Enlightenment texts will also be brought in. Parallel readings in German and English. Discussion in English.",

After a close reading of Freud's theoretical writings on the nature of the mind and human behavior, we will explore why Freud's theories--despite more than a century of criticism--remain highly influential as a framework for the interpretation of art, literature, religion, society, politics, and history.

    "course_description" : "During the early modern period (circa 1450-1800) the world became global. A \"new world\" which challenged \"old world\" frameworks of knowledge was made to accomodate European travellers. This seminar will devote itself to travel literature (broadly conceived) on the Americas to explore questions historical and actual, literary and theoretical: How did contact initially effect the old world? How did its representation evolve over the early modern period? How can a concept of early modern globalism be useful today? Weekly seminar topics will be organized around a single primary text (some available only in Van Pelt's Rare Book Room) and an array of secondary materials. Each participant will lead one seminar session, assigning further readings as s/he determines necessary. A one-day seminar within the seminar will allow students to present their work on early modern globalism in a conference-style format. Each contribution will then be re-worked as the final paper. Primary materials may include: Herzog Ernst; Schedel's Weltchronik; Muenster's Cosmographica, travel accounts by Staden and Hutten; Theodor de Bry's American publications; Ortelius, Blaeu, and Jansson maps; Gottfried's American compilation; travel literature by Penn, Pastorius, and Saur; Insel Felsenburg; Humboldt.",

    "course_description" : "\"We asked for workers. We got people instead.\" This quote by Max Frisch has been frequently cited on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Turkish guest worker migration in 2011. Despite the permanency of the assumed temporary guest worker migration in the 1960s, it was not until the turn of the millenium that Germany was officially considered to be an immigration country. Nevertheless, integration and assimilation are key words not only in the debates on migration to Germany but also in terms of German identity as whole. This course aims to give an overview on migration in/to Germany after the 1960s by looking at significant events around issues of migration as well as by exploring how migration to Germany changed German culture. We will cover events such as the arrival of the guest workers, the fires of Solingen and Molln and the disputes around the highly controversial book by Thilo Sarrazin, as well as texts in a broad sense such as literature, film or music by or on migrants and migration. The central question of the course will be how the cultural landscape in Germany has been influenced by migration in the past 50 years.",

    "course_description" : "Sustainability is more than science, engineering, policy, and design. Surveying the world, we see that the politics and practice of sustainability play out in different ways depending on cultural factors. Some cultures are more prone to pursue ecological goals than others. Why? Do the environmental history and experience of a nation affect policy? Do nature and the environment play a crucial role in the cultural memory of a nation? Can cultural components be effectively leveraged in order to win approval for a politics of sustainability? And what can we, as residents of a country where climate change and global warming are flashpoints in an enduring culture war, learn from other cultures? This course is designed to equip undergraduate students with the historical and cultural tools necessary to understand the cultural aspects of sustainability in two countries noted for their ecological leadership and cultural innovation, Germany and the Netherlands. This hybrid course combines online instruction with a short-term study abroad experience in Berlin and Rotterdam. During the pre-tip online portion of the course, students will become acquainted with the cultural histories of German and Dutch attitudes toward sustainability and the environment through a combination of recorded lectures by the instructor, reading assignments, viewing assignments (documentary and feature films), threaded discussions, and short written assignments. The goal of the pre-trip instruction are to help students develop tools for analyzing and interpreting cultural difference, construct working models of German and Dutch concepts of sustainability, and formulate hypotheses about the relation between culture and policy in Germany and the Netherlands. The class will spend a total of ten days in Europe: five days in Berlin and five days in the area of Rotterdam. The days will be jam-packed with visits to important sites of sustainable practice; discussion with policy makers, activists, and scientists; and immersion in the cultures of the Netherlands and Germany. Upon our return from Europe, the class will debrief and students will present online projects. There are no prerequisites or language requirements.",

Amidst the optimism of the euro's first days, most observers forecast that Europe would progress toward an ever closer union.

In addition, the course familiarizes students with several reading strategies. Students write several essays, weekly reaction pieces, lead discussions, and create short in-class presentations.

In collaborative group work, students create the contents for different components: biography, text analyses, historical background, geography and didactizations emphasizing integrated skills and discourse competence. Their work is posted to a web site, which in turn, is incorporated in the 4th-semester syllabus, where students use the peer-generated information and comprehension checks for their understanding of an abridged version of the authentic literary text.",

    "course_description" : "Russian Awakenings: Western Mysticism and 19th-Century Russian Culture This course will consider the role of western mystical legacy (from Jakob Bohme to Madame Blavatsky) in 19th-Century Russian literature and culture. From the late 18th to early 20th century, Russia witnessed several surges (or \"awakenings\") of mysticism. As a rule, these mystical waves came from the West (usually through German intermediacy) and tended to coincide with critical historical junctures, such as the moral crisis at the end of the reign of Catherine the Great(the rise of Russian Free Masonry), the Russian victory over Napoleon and the establishment of a new European order (the emergence of Russian mystical/political circles of the 1810s), a deep ideological schism in the Russian intelligence in the 1860s (the rise of Russian spiritualism), and finally, the revolutionary period in the first decade of the 20th century. In this course, we will interpret these \"awakenings\" as a particular kind of cultural historical text which symbolically expresses and performs certain tendencies that are typical for the intellectual and psychological life of a given historical period. Our reading list includes works by Western mystics, such as Bohme, Guyon, Swedenborg, Jung-Stilling, Kardec, and Madame Blavatsky, and Russian writers, including Pushkin, Odoevsky, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Solovyov.",

A source of childhood nostalgia, imaginative engagement, and delight, the doll has, however also been the starting point for countless horror movies, in its incarnation as a deviant monster. A magical, talismanic object that animates the world, it hints at the potency of the material world's hold over us as human beings. What desires and anxieties are aroused by dolls? Do dolls have souls? What happens when dolls appear to acquire lives of their own? How have dolls been used as vehicles for social critique, in particular as they relate to representations of commodities, fashion, or the female body? Readings will include: Goethe, Kleist, Hoffmann, Baudelaire, Rilke, Freud.",

    "course_description" : "Our perception of Jewish women around 1800 is shaped by the social and intellectual adventures of Jewish Salonieres and recently re-discovered female writers. The glamorous lives of the romantic writer Dorothea Mendelssohn/Veit/Schlegel and the \"German Wollstonecraft\" Esther Gad/Bernard/Domeier, the Salonieres Rahel Levin/Varnhagen and Henriette de Lemos/Herz, who were instrumental in spreading Goethe's fame and literature, overshadow the existence of most Jewish women of that period. While the aforementioned women sought realizing their self and their ambitions in gentile society, others asked to fulfill their objectives and aspirations within the framework and language of traditional Judaism. The latter group was encouraged to embark on this journey by the speedy religious and socio-political transformation process that changed the life and habits of central European Jewry since the last quarter of the eighteenth century. These transformation processes caused significant changes in the female role model. Whereas traditional Judaism has marginalized women religiously, the structure of bourgeois family placed women in the center of religious performance. In their new role as housewife and mother, women were held responsible for the religious education of their children (male and female) and thus guaranteed the transmission of Judaism to future generations. In preparation for this role, they draw upon the rich literature of text and prayer books for women that were increasingly published in German language. This course aims at capturing the lives of women in Central Europe on the threshold of modernity, between the mid eighteenth and the mid nineteenth century. Starting from different fole models that Jewish society/societies ascribed to women during this period, we will discuss possibilities and limitation of female self-realization. The actual and written biographies of Jewish women will therefore be contrasted with authoritative texts of traditional, enlightened and bourgeois Jewish society, respectively.",

    "course_description" : "The recent economic crisis has drawn the public attention to the cultural history of markets, money, competition and wealth. Issues like these have challenged philosophers, economists, politicians and authors since ancient times. Yet these challenges increased in magnitude aroung 1800 when the old cameralist economy ended. Since then, the defenders of regulatory measures that restrict economic freedom have stood in opposition to those arguing in favour of market liberalism. This ideological rift has been reflected on by literary authors and habits of present day: already Goethe's Wilhelm Meister dealt critically with the attitudes and habits of a salesman, while only a few years ago E. W. Haendler published the novel Wenn\"wir\" sterben with the explicit aim of examining economic behaviour, in effect a literary deployment of insights from J. Schumpeter and M. Foucoult. By the same token, economic documents (such as histories of industriesand \"big deals\") tend to make use of literary techniques--techniques that inspire economic thinking as well. The aim of the seminar is to discuss the most important developments and testimonies of economic writing and thinking from the late eighteenth century until today. The focus will be on German texts but comparative perspectives (relating to works like Zola L'Argent, Sinclair The Jungle, Gaddis J.R.) will be opened up as well.",

We begin by investigating the contested term itself, paying close attention to critics and activists who deplore the very idea that we should try to sustain our, in their eyes, dystopian present, one marked by environmental catastrophe as well as by an assault on the educational ideals long embodied in the humanities. We then turn to classic humanist texts on utopia, beginning with More's fictive island of 1517. The \"origins of environmentalism\" lie in such depictions of island edens (Richard Grove), and our course proceeds to analyze classic utopian tests from American, English, and German literatures. Readings extend to utopian visions from Europe and America of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as literary and visual texts that deal with contemporary nuclear and flood catastrophes. Authors include: Bill McKibben, Jill Kerr Conway, Christopher Newfield, Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Karl Marx, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Owens, William Morris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ayn Rand, Christa Wolf, and others.",

Originating in the work of the French New Wave, auteurism has shaped our understanding of many film cultures around the world and across different media beyond the cinema. This course will examine the history of auteurism as it has evolved from France to the U.S. and through national cinemas from China and India to Iran and Denmark. As part of this study, we'll investigate the changing theoretical terms of auteurism as it has adapted to the pressures of post-structuralist theory, feminist interventions, cultural and racial distinctions, and the challenges of new media.",

In the realm of literary and cultural theory, however, Freud's work seems to have relevance still, and is cited often. How do we understand the gap between a medical/scientific reading of Freud's work, and a humanist one? Where do we locate Freud's relevance today? The graduate course will concentrate on Freud's descriptions of psychoanalytic theory and practice, as well as his writings on literature and culture.",

    "course_description" : "The year is 1933. Hitler and the Nazis have assumed power in Germany. As the Nobel-Prize-winning author Thomas Mann, famous for his novels The Buddenbrooks and The Magic Mountain, and his Jewish wife Katia go into exile in various European countries and eventually the United States (Princeton and Los Angeles), the first of his four novels about Joseph, the son of Jacob and provider for the Jews in Egypt,is published. Mann would go on to write three novels about Joseph and his brothers, completing the tetralogy in 1943. In this course we will discuss the novels against their complex cultural background. How does Mann get from 13 chapters in the Book of Genesis and a trip to Palestine to a monumental work of literature, which he considered his most important and which sustained him throughout his exile? How does this elaborate and provocative work of historical fiction comment on the geopolitical situation of his own time, not only the horrors of the Third Reich, but also Franklin Roosevelt and the politics of the New Deal, in which Mann recognized the good government of Joseph of Egypt? We'll test the idea that Mann regarded the Joseph story as an alternative cultural epic to the Nordic sagas favored by Richard Wagner in The Ring of the Nibelungen, often regarded as a source for Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. We'll also look into Mann's sources in biblical archaelogy, textual scholarship and interpretation, and Egyptology. Most importantly, we will immerse ourselves in the fictional world of Thomas Mann's Joseph.",

We will ask how students' lives and universities as a whole change through the use of digital media and how the buzz word digital humanities relates to that.

A lot of writers expressed their believes and ideas for future societies in their literary works. What were those ideas? Were they different on both sides of the former front?
