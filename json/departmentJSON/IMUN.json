The course will be taught as formal lectures on Monday and Wednesday and a diThe minicourses will be taught as a combination of formal lectures and seminar-format discussions of relevant literature. Each minicourse will have a slightly different format. The minicourses will consist of 6 hours/week for 4 weeks. The semester will be divided into 3 sessions with between 2 to 3 minicourses offered each session. Progress in the course will be evaluated by an exam/paper at the end of each minicourse and class participation. The exams will require students to incorporate the knowledge and thinking gained from the in depth analyses of these topics.",

Furthermore the course will give the student a sense of how these principles are applied to vaccine and immune therapeutic development. The course covers basic science as well as the Clinical, Ethical & Political implications of Modern Vaccines. Initial lectures will review immune mechanisms believed to be responsible for vaccine induced protection from disease. Subsequent lectures build on this background to explore the science of vaccines for diverse pathogens, including agents of bioterrorism as well as vaccines for cancer. An appreciation for the application of laboratory science to the clinical development of vaccines is provided in the next section of the course along with lectures that focus on the ethical implications of vaccines in different situations. The financial implications of specific vaccines and their impact on the global community, is a specific focus of the course. The course is lecture style and will have a required reading list prepared in advance to provide the students background for the specific topic. Students will be graded by course participation as well as by a final written exam. The course is intended for graduate students or Medical Students in various MS, Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs on the campus as well as local scientists and professionals in the community. As a prerequisite students should have taken biology, biochemistry or immunology courses at the advanced college level. A final project will be graded from all students. The final project is to propose in a written report a vaccine strategy for a current pathogen of importance that does not as yet have an effective vaccine. Strategies used should build on the material presented in the class lectures. The details of the final paper will be further discussed in class.",
