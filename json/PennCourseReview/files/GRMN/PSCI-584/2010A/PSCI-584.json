{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2663"}, "description": "An examination of basic theoretical problems of political science divided into three parts. First, specific features of social sciences will be examined and three most important general orientations of social sciences (analytical, interpretative and critical) will be compared and analyzed. Second, basic concepts of social and political sciences will be studied: social determination, rationality, social change, politics, power, state, democracy. Third, the problem of value judgments will be considered: Is there a rational, objective method for the resolution of conflicts in value judgments? Is morality compatible with politics? \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "CARL SCHMITT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26683/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "CARL SCHMITT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-584-401", "path": "/courses/26683/sections/401", "id": "26683-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-584-401", "GRMN-650-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/26683/sections/401/reviews/265-ELLEN-LEE-KENNEDY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/265-ELLEN-LEE-KENNEDY", "first_name": "ELLEN LEE", "last_name": "KENNEDY", "id": "265-ELLEN-LEE-KENNEDY", "name": "ELLEN LEE KENNEDY"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "26683-401-265-ELLEN-LEE-KENNEDY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-584", "path": "/courses/26683", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26683/sections", "values": [{"name": "CARL SCHMITT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-584-401", "path": "/courses/26683/sections/401", "id": "26683-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-584-401", "GRMN-650-401"]}]}, "id": 26683, "aliases": ["PSCI-584", "GRMN-650"]}
