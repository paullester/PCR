{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/544"}, "description": "A continuation of GRMN 103. Expands students writing and speaking competence in German, increases vocabulary and helps students practice effective reading and listening strategies. Our in-class discussions are based on weekly readings of literary and non-literary texts to facilitate exchange of information, ideas, reactions, and opinions. In addition, the readings provide cultural and historical background information. The review of grammar will not be the primary focus of the course. Students will, however, expand and deepen their knowledge of grammar through specific grammar exercises. Students will conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an authentic literary text: Thomas Brussig Am k?rzeren Ende der Sonnenallee offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18757/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.50", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.70", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.80", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rInstructorConcern": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rClassPace": "2.20", "rExamsConsistent": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rGradeFairness": "3.10", "rArticulateGoals": "3.60", "rOralSkills": "3.60", "rNativeAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rInstructorEffective": "3.60", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-104-001", "path": "/courses/18757/sections/001", "id": "18757-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-104-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/18757/sections/001/reviews/2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN", "first_name": "CLAUDIA", "last_name": "LYNN", "id": "2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN", "name": "CLAUDIA LYNN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "18757-001-2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN"}, {"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.50", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.67", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.67", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rInstructorConcern": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rClassPace": "2.50", "rExamsConsistent": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rGradeFairness": "3.83", "rArticulateGoals": "3.33", "rOralSkills": "3.33", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rInstructorEffective": "3.50", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "GRMN-104-002", "path": "/courses/18757/sections/002", "id": "18757-002", "aliases": ["GRMN-104-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/18757/sections/002/reviews/2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN", "first_name": "CLAUDIA", "last_name": "LYNN", "id": "2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN", "name": "CLAUDIA LYNN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "18757-002-2991-CLAUDIA-LYNN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-104", "path": "/courses/18757", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18757/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-104-001", "path": "/courses/18757/sections/001", "id": "18757-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-104-001"]}, {"name": "INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "GRMN-104-002", "path": "/courses/18757/sections/002", "id": "18757-002", "aliases": ["GRMN-104-002"]}]}, "id": 18757, "aliases": ["GRMN-104"]}
