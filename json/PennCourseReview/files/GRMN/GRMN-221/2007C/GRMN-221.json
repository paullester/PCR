{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/549"}, "description": "This course is designed to help the student develop a more sophisticated writing style in German. This is achieved by means of the study and discussion of the fine points of German syntax (e.g. correct usage of tenses, punctuation, experimentation with word order, etc.), by a variety of exercises in finding synonyms, similes, analogies, and rhetorical strategies, and by exposure to numerous idioms. Emphasis is also placed on determining the appropriate usage of language in a specific situation. The ultimate objective of this course is therefore to encourage an active and imaginative use of the German language. Students should be prepared to undertake an active role in critiquing one another's writing. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "ADV GRAMMAR & STYLISTICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13345/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "4.00", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rClassPace": "2.67", "rExamsConsistent": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rGradeFairness": "3.67", "rArticulateGoals": "3.50", "rOralSkills": "3.33", "rNativeAbility": "0.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rInstructorEffective": "3.67", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "ADV GRAMMAR & STYLISTICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-221-001", "path": "/courses/13345/sections/001", "id": "13345-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-221-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/13345/sections/001/reviews/592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "first_name": "FRANCIS B.", "last_name": "BREVART", "id": "592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "name": "FRANCIS B.
