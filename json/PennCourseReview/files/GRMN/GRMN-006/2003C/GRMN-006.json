{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2299"}, "description": "\"Monstrous\" creatures - both human and non-human - have fascinated Europeans since the days of the Greek republic. In the late Middle Ages and early modern period, a new communications medium, the printed broadside, opened the door to a flood of \"tabloids,\" small, cheap texts with lurid pictures and graphic descriptions of two-headed babies, deformed animals and exotic creatures from distant lands. We will read some of these texts firsthand and try to understand from them the ways that Westerners viewed the world around them and beyond the seas. We will discuss the war of words between Martin Luther and the pope, whom he called the anti-Christ, and we will consider the role of women and the increased misogyny that, by the seventeeth century, led to the madness of the witch craze. Most of all, we will discover how to use old texts, historical both in their form and content, as windows into a culture quite different from our own. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MONSTERS AND MARVELS: \"Tabloid\" Broadsides of Early Modern Europe", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4203/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.87", "rReadingsValue": "3.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "MONSTERS AND MARVELS: \"Tabloid\" Broadsides of Early Modern Europe", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-006-301", "path": "/courses/4203/sections/301", "id": "4203-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-006-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/4203/sections/301/reviews/2161-NIEL-MCDOWELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2161-NIEL-MCDOWELL", "first_name": "NIEL", "last_name": "MCDOWELL", "id": "2161-NIEL-MCDOWELL", "name": "NIEL MCDOWELL"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "4203-301-2161-NIEL-MCDOWELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-006", "path": "/courses/4203", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4203/sections", "values": [{"name": "MONSTERS AND MARVELS: \"Tabloid\" Broadsides of Early Modern Europe", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-006-301", "path": "/courses/4203/sections/301", "id": "4203-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-006-301"]}]}, "id": 4203, "aliases": ["GRMN-006"]}
