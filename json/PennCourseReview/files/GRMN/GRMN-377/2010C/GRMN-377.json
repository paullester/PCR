{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1886"}, "description": "In January 1999, a single monetary system united Germany, a core nation, with 10 other European states. Since January 2002 Euro bank notes and coins have gone into circulation in 12 European countries. The European Union is now stronger than ever before, and on May 1, 2004 ten more countries joined the EU - the largest-ever expansion. Is the EU benefiting from this enlargement or does the arrival of so many new members drain money from the EU budget and slow down the EU decision-making? This course will provide an overview of the political and economic developments towards integration in post-war Europe, focusing on Germany's key role. Studying content-rich reading materials, it explores historic-political, social, economic and cultural issues that are urgent for Germany as well as the European community. Accompanying activities will help students to improve the level of complexity of their language skills. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "GERMANY & THE EURO UNION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23167/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.83", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "GERMANY & THE EURO UNION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-377-001", "path": "/courses/23167/sections/001", "id": "23167-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-377-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/23167/sections/001/reviews/1482-SUSANNE-W--SHIELDS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1482-SUSANNE-W--SHIELDS", "first_name": "SUSANNE W.", "last_name": "SHIELDS", "id": "1482-SUSANNE-W--SHIELDS", "name": "SUSANNE W.
