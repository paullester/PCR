{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/555"}, "description": "Decadence, eroticism, disease, sexuality, the decline of the merchant class, vacationing in Italy, the difficulties getting in step for the next dance (or the \"dance of life\" as opposed to the \"dance of death\"), living in sanatorium for several years up in the Swiss Alps. If any of these things sound like interesting topics to you, think about Mann? Oh, Mann! We will be reading two major novels of Thomas Mann (Buddenbrooks and Zauberberg) as well as a number of short stories by the same author. We'll discuss the above topics as well as things like the role of the art in society and the role of music in our lives. We will of course also discuss the philosophies underlying the works of Thomas Mann, including especially Nietzsche and Shopenhauer, as well as the role of the works of Richard Wagner in Mann's works. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "MANN?
