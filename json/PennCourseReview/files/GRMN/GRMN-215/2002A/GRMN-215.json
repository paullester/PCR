{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/546"}, "description": "Offers students the opportunity to improve significantly written and spoken discourse strategies and to raise language competence to an academic register. In addition, the course familiarizes students with several reading strategies. Students write several essays, weekly reaction pieces, lead discussions, and create short in-class presentations. During the second half of the semester, students create a common course web site in connection with their readings of an authentic literary text. In collaborative group work, students create the contents for different components: biography, text analyses, historical background, geography and didactizations emphasizing integrated skills and discourse competence. Their work is posted to a web site, which in turn, is incorporated in the 4th-semester syllabus, where students use the peer-generated information and comprehension checks for their understanding of an abridged version of the authentic literary text. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CONVERSATION AND COMPOSI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/546/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "1.50", "rTAQuality": "0.57", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "2.80", "rInstructorAttitude": "2.20", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rInstructorConcern": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.30", "rClassPace": "2.70", "rExamsConsistent": "3.30", "rInstructorAccess": "2.70", "rGradeFairness": "2.00", "rArticulateGoals": "2.80", "rOralSkills": "2.50", "rNativeAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "1.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.10", "rInstructorEffective": "2.20", "rSkillEmphasis": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "CONVERSATION AND COMPOSI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-215-001", "path": "/courses/546/sections/001", "id": "546-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-215-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/546/sections/001/reviews/585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER", "first_name": "JOSEPH W", "last_name": "MOSER", "id": "585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER", "name": "JOSEPH W MOSER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "546-001-585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER"}, {"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.71", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.71", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.86", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.57", "rInstructorConcern": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rClassPace": "2.43", "rExamsConsistent": "3.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rGradeFairness": "3.57", "rArticulateGoals": "3.57", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "3.57", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "CONVERSATION AND COMPOSI", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "GRMN-215-002", "path": "/courses/546/sections/002", "id": "546-002", "aliases": ["GRMN-215-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/546/sections/002/reviews/589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC", "first_name": "GORDANA", "last_name": "GROZDANIC", "id": "589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC", "name": "GORDANA GROZDANIC"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "546-002-589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-215", "path": "/courses/546", "sections": {"path": "/courses/546/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONVERSATION AND COMPOSI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-215-001", "path": "/courses/546/sections/001", "id": "546-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-215-001"]}, {"name": "CONVERSATION AND COMPOSI", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "GRMN-215-002", "path": "/courses/546/sections/002", "id": "546-002", "aliases": ["GRMN-215-002"]}]}, "id": 546, "aliases": ["GRMN-215"]}
