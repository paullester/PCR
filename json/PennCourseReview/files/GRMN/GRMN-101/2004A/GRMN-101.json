{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/541"}, "description": "Designed for the beginning student with no previous knowledge of German. German 101, as the first course in the first-year series, focuses on the development of language competence in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage in simple conversations about familiar things, know greetings and everyday expressions, they will be ble to count and tell time, and negate sentences in day-to-day contexts. Furthermore, students will be able to speak about events that happened in the immediate past and express plans for the future. In addition, students will have developed reading strategies that allow them to glean information from simple newspaper and magazine articles and short literary texts. Because cultural knowledge is one of the foci of German 101, students will learn much about practical life in Germany and will explore German-speaking cultures on the Internet. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ELEMENTARY GERMAN I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6620/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "2.80", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "2.60", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.20", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rInstructorConcern": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rClassPace": "1.80", "rExamsConsistent": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rGradeFairness": "3.20", "rArticulateGoals": "3.80", "rOralSkills": "2.20", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "0.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.20", "rInstructorEffective": "3.60", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY GERMAN I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-101-001", "path": "/courses/6620/sections/001", "id": "6620-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-101-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/6620/sections/001/reviews/585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER", "first_name": "JOSEPH W", "last_name": "MOSER", "id": "585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER", "name": "JOSEPH W MOSER"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "6620-001-585-JOSEPH-W-MOSER"}, {"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.80", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.75", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.88", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "3.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rGradeFairness": "3.88", "rArticulateGoals": "3.88", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88", "rWorkRequired": "1.88", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "3.88", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY GERMAN I", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "GRMN-101-002", "path": "/courses/6620/sections/002", "id": "6620-002", "aliases": ["GRMN-101-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/6620/sections/002/reviews/580-CHRISTINA-FREI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/580-CHRISTINA-FREI", "first_name": "CHRISTINA", "last_name": "FREI", "id": "580-CHRISTINA-FREI", "name": "CHRISTINA FREI"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "6620-002-580-CHRISTINA-FREI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-101", "path": "/courses/6620", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6620/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY GERMAN I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-101-001", "path": "/courses/6620/sections/001", "id": "6620-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-101-001"]}, {"name": "ELEMENTARY GERMAN I", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "GRMN-101-002", "path": "/courses/6620/sections/002", "id": "6620-002", "aliases": ["GRMN-101-002"]}]}, "id": 6620, "aliases": ["GRMN-101"]}
