{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3099"}, "description": "Sixteen years after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the Wende and the Wiedervereinigung are still primary themes in contemporary German culture. In this course we will familiarize ourselves with the political events that lead to the Fall of the Berlin Wall and, one year later, to the so-called Wiedervereinigung. We will examine examine the representation of Wende and Wiedervereinigung in recent German literature and films. Special attention will be given to works which deal with Ostalgie (nostalgia for the former GDR/East Germany) and a group of young authors who approach the East German past from an 'idealistic' (ich meine: idealisierend, nicht idealistisch) perspective. Primary readings will include Jana Hensels Zonenkinder, Claudia Ruschs Meine freie deutsche Jugend, Peter Schneiders Extreme Mittellage as well as authors like Monika Maron and G?nter Grass. The following films will enhance our ability to assess the cutting-edge German art scene: Wolfgang Becker's Good bye, Lenin, Sebastian Peterson's Helden wie wir and Hannes St?hr's Berlin is in Germany. This material/These sources will be supplemented by excerpts from German periodicals and Ostalgie TV-Shows. All readings and discussions will be conducted in German. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "FALL OF BERLIN WALL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7821/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.85", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.08", "rCommAbility": "3.77", "rInstructorQuality": "3.77"}, "section": {"name": "FALL OF BERLIN WALL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-359-001", "path": "/courses/7821/sections/001", "id": "7821-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-359-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/7821/sections/001/reviews/2993-KAROLIN-MACHTANS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2993-KAROLIN-MACHTANS", "first_name": "KAROLIN", "last_name": "MACHTANS", "id": "2993-KAROLIN-MACHTANS", "name": "KAROLIN MACHTANS"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "7821-001-2993-KAROLIN-MACHTANS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-359", "path": "/courses/7821", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7821/sections", "values": [{"name": "FALL OF BERLIN WALL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-359-001", "path": "/courses/7821/sections/001", "id": "7821-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-359-001"]}]}, "id": 7821, "aliases": ["GRMN-359"]}
