{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2064"}, "description": "Kant's philosophy has been one of the most influential positions in the history of western thought. Traces of its influence can be discovered in almost all areas and disciplines of contemporary philosophy, especially in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The best known (and most important) documents of Kant's philosophical views are his three Critiques, i.e., the Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87) dealing with topics in epistemology and metaphysics, the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) focusing on topics in ethics and morality, and the Critique of Judgment (1790) treating questions concerning aesthetics and biology. The course will concentrate on the Critique of Pure Reason and discuss in detail Kant's conception of knowledge and experience, his criticism of traditional metaphysics and the resulting project of a system of transcendental philosophy. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "KANT I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3366/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "3.76", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.90", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.76", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "KANT I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-465-401", "path": "/courses/3366/sections/401", "id": "3366-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-465-401", "GRMN-551-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/3366/sections/401/reviews/1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "first_name": "PAUL D", "last_name": "GUYER", "id": "1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "name": "PAUL D GUYER"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "3366-401-1670-PAUL-D-GUYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-465", "path": "/courses/3366", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3366/sections", "values": [{"name": "KANT I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-465-401", "path": "/courses/3366/sections/401", "id": "3366-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-465-401", "GRMN-551-401"]}]}, "id": 3366, "aliases": ["PHIL-465", "GRMN-551"]}
