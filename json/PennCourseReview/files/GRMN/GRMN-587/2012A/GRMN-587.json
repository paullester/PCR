{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5422"}, "description": "The work of Richard Wagner holds a pre-eminent place in German intellectual history. Its aesthetic form revolutionized musical theater, prepared the grounds for musical modernity and avant-garde, foreshadowed Hollywood's film music, and left many traces in literature and the visual arts. At the same time, its ideological claims had profound impact on Germany's self-understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries, founded the Wagner-cult in Bayreuth, provided the political establishment with a doubtful frame of reference, and are deeply burdened with their reception. Wagner attempted to create nothing less than a modern myth. The aim of this seminar is to penetrate into this myth, into its \"ecstasy of lust and knowledge\" (Baudelaire), with understanding and distance. We will discuss texts about Wagner by, inter alia, Thomas Mann, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Friedrich Nietzsche, Theodor W. Adorno--and, of course, the works and writings of Wagner himself. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Richard Wagner - Art, Myth, Politics", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27518/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "Richard Wagner - Art, Myth, Politics", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-587-301", "path": "/courses/27518/sections/301", "id": "27518-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-587-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/27518/sections/301/reviews/4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS", "first_name": "GUNNAR", "last_name": "HINDRICHS", "id": "4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS", "name": "GUNNAR HINDRICHS"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "27518-301-4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-587", "path": "/courses/27518", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27518/sections", "values": [{"name": "Richard Wagner - Art, Myth, Politics", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-587-301", "path": "/courses/27518/sections/301", "id": "27518-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-587-301"]}]}, "id": 27518, "aliases": ["GRMN-587"]}
