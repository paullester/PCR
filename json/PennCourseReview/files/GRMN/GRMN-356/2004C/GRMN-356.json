{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2590"}, "description": "The detective story and the crime drama are time-honored genres of literature and popular culture. We are drawn to morbid scenes of violence and crime, and satisfied by the apprehension of criminals and their punishment. At the same time, the process of detection, of deciphering clues, is much like the process of reading and interpretion. \n\nIn this course we will read a variety of detective and crime stories, some by famous authors (e.g., Droste-Huelshoff, Fontane, Handke), others by contemporary authors that address interesting aspects of German culture (e.g., Turkish-Germans, gay and lesbian subcultures, DDR and Wende). We will also look at episodes from popular West, East, and post-reunification German TV crime shows (e.g., Tatort). \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "CRIME AND DETECTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5410/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "CRIME AND DETECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-356-001", "path": "/courses/5410/sections/001", "id": "5410-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-356-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/5410/sections/001/reviews/589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC", "first_name": "GORDANA", "last_name": "GROZDANIC", "id": "589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC", "name": "GORDANA GROZDANIC"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "5410-001-589-GORDANA-GROZDANIC"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-356", "path": "/courses/5410", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5410/sections", "values": [{"name": "CRIME AND DETECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-356-001", "path": "/courses/5410/sections/001", "id": "5410-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-356-001"]}]}, "id": 5410, "aliases": ["GRMN-356"]}
