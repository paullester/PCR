{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1329"}, "description": "In this course we will read medieval works of international literary importance, such as the Arthurian novels of Hartman von Aue Erec and Iwein, the German Song of the Nibelungs and the Old French Song of Roland as examples of heroic literature, and the tragic love story of Tristan and Isolde by Gottfried von Strasburg. We will also read two Spielmannsepen which have as their central theme the international motif of the bridal quest, namely Sankt Oswald and Koenig Rother, and compare these works with the Nibelungenlied and Tristan, which themselves also involve the bridal quest as one of their principal structural elements. \n\nThere is, however, a major and critical distinction between the traditional happy ending of the bridal quest epics and that of The Nibelungs and of Tristan and Isolde, for those two German works culminate in the total destruction and disintegration of entire peoples and values, or with the utter misery of the ideal couple. With our readings of the love poems of the French Troubadours and those of their German counterparts, the Minnesaenger, our final genre of medieval literature, we will not only discuss the ubiquitous and timeless love theme in all its variations, but also the socio-political implications of such poetry. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "HEROES MINSTRELS KNIGHTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14580/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.89", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "HEROES MINSTRELS KNIGHTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-246-001", "path": "/courses/14580/sections/001", "id": "14580-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-246-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/14580/sections/001/reviews/592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "first_name": "FRANCIS B.", "last_name": "BREVART", "id": "592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "name": "FRANCIS B.
