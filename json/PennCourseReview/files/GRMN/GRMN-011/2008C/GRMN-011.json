{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4729"}, "description": "\"Beauty is not a quality inherent to things: it only exists in the mind of the beholder.\" (David Hume) \"Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier.\" (Pierre Bourdieu) \"Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see children on the grass. The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass! The second tear makes kitsch kitsch.\" (Milan Kundera) \n\nMost of us can recognize bad taste as soon as we see it: Harlequin romances, Elvis on black velvet, lawn ornaments. But bad taste also has a history, and kitsch has been identified as a peculiarly modern invention related to capitalism and consumerism. Beginning with a discussion of taste in the eighteenth century (Hume, Kant), we will investigate under what conditions good taste can go bad, for example when it is the object of mass reproduction, and, on the other hand, why bad taste in recent times has increasingly been recuperated as an art form. Categories such as the cute, the sentimental, the miniature, kitsch, and camp will be explored. We will also ask what forms of ideological work have been done by this brand of aesthetics, for example in the connection between politics and kitsch, feminity and the low-brow, or camp and queer identity. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "BAD TASTE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18753/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.15", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "2.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.69", "rCourseQuality": "2.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.15", "rCommAbility": "3.23", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "BAD TASTE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-011-301", "path": "/courses/18753/sections/301", "id": "18753-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-011-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/18753/sections/301/reviews/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "first_name": "CATRIONA", "last_name": "MACLEOD", "id": "1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "name": "CATRIONA MACLEOD"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "18753-301-1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-011", "path": "/courses/18753", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18753/sections", "values": [{"name": "BAD TASTE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-011-301", "path": "/courses/18753/sections/301", "id": "18753-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-011-301"]}]}, "id": 18753, "aliases": ["GRMN-011"]}
