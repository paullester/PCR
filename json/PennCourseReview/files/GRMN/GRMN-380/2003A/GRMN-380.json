{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1331"}, "description": "The concept of Heimat (homeland, home, roots) has been a focal point of German culture for at least the past two hundred years; but it has no precise translation into English. Heimat is deeply connected with German notions of modernity, nature, community, and gender; but the question of where one belongs has also been associated with escapism, exclusion and marginality. Beginning with a reading of Freud's essay \"Das Unheimliche,\" we will explore literary representations of Heimat (including works by authors such as Eichendorff, Storm, Stifter, Raabe, and Sebald); nineteenth-century paintings by artists such as Leibl; and Edgar Reitz's epic film Heimat (1984). \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "HEIMAT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1730/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "HEIMAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-380-001", "path": "/courses/1730/sections/001", "id": "1730-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-380-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/1730/sections/001/reviews/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "first_name": "CATRIONA", "last_name": "MACLEOD", "id": "1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "name": "CATRIONA MACLEOD"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "1730-001-1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-380", "path": "/courses/1730", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1730/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEIMAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-380-001", "path": "/courses/1730/sections/001", "id": "1730-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-380-001"]}]}, "id": 1730, "aliases": ["GRMN-380"]}
