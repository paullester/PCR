{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2835"}, "description": "In the true spirit of a colloquium (= an informal meeting for the exchange of views), this course provides you with the opportunity to engage in a series of conversations about your thesis project. \n\nOur discussions will focus on research tools and methods and on the writing process. It is tailored as much as possible to meet individual needs. Most importantly, the colloquium should not add to the burden of writing a thesis but should facilitate its completion. Thus, its primary goal is a successfully completed senior thesis. To assist you in obtaining this goal, several short written assignments will be required. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "SENIOR COLLOQUIUM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26146/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "SENIOR COLLOQUIUM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-395-301", "path": "/courses/26146/sections/301", "id": "26146-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-395-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/26146/sections/301/reviews/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "first_name": "BETHANY", "last_name": "WIGGIN", "id": "2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "name": "BETHANY WIGGIN"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "26146-301-2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-395", "path": "/courses/26146", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26146/sections", "values": [{"name": "SENIOR COLLOQUIUM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-395-301", "path": "/courses/26146/sections/301", "id": "26146-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-395-301"]}]}, "id": 26146, "aliases": ["GRMN-395"]}
