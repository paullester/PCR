{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2654"}, "description": "More than a century after Sigmund Freud transformed--for better or worse-- our understanding of what it means to be human, Freudian psychoanalysis still exerts a profound influence in our cluture. This seminar course is an exploration of the philosophical issues raised by Freudian psychoanalysis as a theory of mind and culture. After a close reading of Freud's theoretical writings on the nature of the mind and human behavior, we will explore why Freud's theories--despite more than a century of criticism--remain highly influential as a framework for the interpretation of art, literature, religion, society, politics, and history. Readings from Freud's \"meta-psychological\", cultural, and social writings, Paul Ricoeur's Freud and Philosophy, and other contemporary authors in philosophy, psychoanalysis, and other fields. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis, psychology, or philosophy required. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY: Phil of Psychology:  Epistemic Realism", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29502/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY: Phil of Psychology:  Epistemic Realism", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-526-301", "path": "/courses/29502/sections/301", "id": "29502-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-526-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/29502/sections/301/reviews/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "first_name": "GARY", "last_name": "HATFIELD", "id": "1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "name": "GARY HATFIELD"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "29502-301-1671-GARY-HATFIELD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-526", "path": "/courses/29502", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29502/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY: Phil of Psychology:  Epistemic Realism", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-526-301", "path": "/courses/29502/sections/301", "id": "29502-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-526-301"]}]}, "id": 29502, "aliases": ["PHIL-526"]}
