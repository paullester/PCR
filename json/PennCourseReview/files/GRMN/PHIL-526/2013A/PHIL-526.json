{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2654"}, "description": "More than a century after Sigmund Freud transformed--for better or worse-- our understanding of what it means to be human, Freudian psychoanalysis still exerts a profound influence in our cluture. This seminar course is an exploration of the philosophical issues raised by Freudian psychoanalysis as a theory of mind and culture. After a close reading of Freud's theoretical writings on the nature of the mind and human behavior, we will explore why Freud's theories--despite more than a century of criticism--remain highly influential as a framework for the interpretation of art, literature, religion, society, politics, and history. Readings from Freud's \"meta-psychological\", cultural, and social writings, Paul Ricoeur's Freud and Philosophy, and other contemporary authors in philosophy, psychoanalysis, and other fields. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis, psychology, or philosophy required. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Freud and the Interpretation of Culture", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30863/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Freud and the Interpretation of Culture", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "PHIL-526-640", "path": "/courses/30863/sections/640", "id": "30863-640", "aliases": ["PHIL-526-640", "GRMN-527-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/30863/sections/640/reviews/957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "first_name": "STEPHEN P", "last_name": "STEINBERG", "id": "957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "name": "STEPHEN P STEINBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "30863-640-957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-526", "path": "/courses/30863", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30863/sections", "values": [{"name": "Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Freud and the Interpretation of Culture", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "PHIL-526-640", "path": "/courses/30863/sections/640", "id": "30863-640", "aliases": ["PHIL-526-640", "GRMN-527-640"]}]}, "id": 30863, "aliases": ["PHIL-526", "GRMN-527"]}
