{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2834"}, "description": "In this class we will focus on how literary hi/stories are (re)written, and to what ends. Over the course of the semester, texts from the seventeenth century will be paired alongside a rewrite from the twentieth. Paired readings may include: Martin Opitz (Buch von der deutschen Poeterey) and G?nther Grass (Das Treffen in Telgt), Grimmelshausen (Coursache) and Bertold Brecht (Mutter Courage) and Abraham ? Sancta Clara (Predigten) and Barbara Frischmuth (Die Klosterschule). In our discussions, we will explore a series of related questions: How does the older text resonate within the new? How does the newer text comment on the old? What are the politics of such dialogues with the distant past? \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "POLITICS OF THE PAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6635/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "POLITICS OF THE PAST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-325-001", "path": "/courses/6635/sections/001", "id": "6635-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-325-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/6635/sections/001/reviews/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "first_name": "BETHANY", "last_name": "WIGGIN", "id": "2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "name": "BETHANY WIGGIN"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "6635-001-2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-325", "path": "/courses/6635", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6635/sections", "values": [{"name": "POLITICS OF THE PAST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-325-001", "path": "/courses/6635/sections/001", "id": "6635-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-325-001"]}]}, "id": 6635, "aliases": ["GRMN-325"]}
