{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3648"}, "description": "For centuries the \"Orient\" has functioned as an important concept in formulating a European as well as a specifically German identity. In the context of today's debates about the expansion of Europe and the so-called war on terrorism, it is a concept which demands further historical investigation. On the basis of travel narratives and other texts, we will explore this key term, noting how it has been insistently (re)formulated since the beginnings of modernity. We will also investigate several theoretical models which can help us to think through the cultural encounters documented in the primary works. A series of fundamental questions will accompany us through the semester: Where is the East? Is the East a homogenous place eliciting either fear or wonder? Who lives in the East and how are the \"customs and manners\" of its inhabitants comprehended? What happens to a German in the East? And, vice versa, what happens to an \"Oriental\" in Germany? Is the East only in the East? Can one also find the East in Germany? \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "FOREIGN EXCHANGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15850/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "FOREIGN EXCHANGE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-318-401", "path": "/courses/15850/sections/401", "id": "15850-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-318-401", "GRMN-536-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/15850/sections/401/reviews/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "first_name": "BETHANY", "last_name": "WIGGIN", "id": "2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "name": "BETHANY WIGGIN"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "15850-401-2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-318", "path": "/courses/15850", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15850/sections", "values": [{"name": "FOREIGN EXCHANGE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-318-401", "path": "/courses/15850/sections/401", "id": "15850-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-318-401", "GRMN-536-401"]}]}, "id": 15850, "aliases": ["GRMN-318", "GRMN-536"]}
