{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/545"}, "description": "The German House is a half-credit course with concentrations in German conversation, film, and culture. Though many students enroll for credit, others often come to select events. All interested parties are invited, and you do not have to actually live in the house to enroll for credit. Students from all different levels of language proficiency are welcome. Beginners learn from more advanced students, and all enjoy a relaxed environment for maintaining or improving their German language skills. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "GERMAN IN RESIDENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27507/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.60", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rClassPace": "2.40", "rExamsConsistent": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rGradeFairness": "3.80", "rArticulateGoals": "3.80", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "0.40", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "3.80", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "GERMAN IN RESIDENCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-180-001", "path": "/courses/27507/sections/001", "id": "27507-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-180-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/27507/sections/001/reviews/5757-KATIE-E-HOLMQUIST", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5757-KATIE-E-HOLMQUIST", "first_name": "KATIE E", "last_name": "HOLMQUIST", "id": "5757-KATIE-E-HOLMQUIST", "name": "KATIE E HOLMQUIST"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "27507-001-5757-KATIE-E-HOLMQUIST"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-180", "path": "/courses/27507", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27507/sections", "values": [{"name": "GERMAN IN RESIDENCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-180-001", "path": "/courses/27507/sections/001", "id": "27507-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-180-001"]}]}, "id": 27507, "aliases": ["GRMN-180"]}
