{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4271"}, "description": "Japan, Turkey, Bosnia, and East-Germany-what do these countries have in common? This course investigates texts by contemporary \"German\" authors with diverse roots, who live in between countries, cultures, heritages,traditions and languages. All have either immigrated to or were born in Germany. Currently, each author lives and works in Germany, writing in German and in their respective \"mother tongue\". Each author differently questions issues of nationhood and nationality and challenges traditional notions of what it means to be \"German\" and living in today's Germany. Through the critical reading of their colorful prose, you deepen your understanding of the complexities of global citizenry and look into fixed categories of identity formation. In addition, you break open stereotypical imaginations of what German literature entails. The course has two particular areas of concentration: Turkey and the European Union. Germany and 20 years after reunification. Authors include Yoko Tawada, Feridun Zaimoglu, Hatice Aky?n und Fatih Akin, Julia Zeh (Ed.) und Ingo Schulze. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "CONTEMP GRMN WRITERS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15851/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEMP GRMN WRITERS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-387-001", "path": "/courses/15851/sections/001", "id": "15851-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-387-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/15851/sections/001/reviews/580-CHRISTINA-FREI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/580-CHRISTINA-FREI", "first_name": "CHRISTINA", "last_name": "FREI", "id": "580-CHRISTINA-FREI", "name": "CHRISTINA FREI"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "15851-001-580-CHRISTINA-FREI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-387", "path": "/courses/15851", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15851/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEMP GRMN WRITERS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-387-001", "path": "/courses/15851/sections/001", "id": "15851-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-387-001"]}]}, "id": 15851, "aliases": ["GRMN-387"]}
