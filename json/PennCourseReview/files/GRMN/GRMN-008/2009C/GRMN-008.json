{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1876"}, "description": "Individuals in medieval times lived basically the same way we do today: they ate, drank, needed shelter, worked in a variety of ways to earn a living, and planned their lives around religious holidays. They talked about the weather and had sex, they had to deal with cold, hunger, illness, epidemics and natural catastrophes. Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury, went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write. And fewer still managed to obtain some form of higher education in cathedral schools and nascent universities and became teachers themselves. Those eager to learn about other people and foreign customs traveled to distant places and brought back with them much knowledge and new ideas. The similarities, we will all agree, are striking. But what is of interest to us are the differences, the \"alterity\" (keyword) of the ways in which they carried out these actions and fulfilled their goals. This course concentrates on two very broad aspects of daily life in the Middle Ages (12 th - 16 th centuries). The first part, Erudition, focuses on the world in and around the University. The second part, Superstition, revolves around astrology, medicine and pharmacy. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "SUPERSTITION & ERUDITION: Daily Life in the Middle Ages", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17442/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "SUPERSTITION & ERUDITION: Daily Life in the Middle Ages", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-008-301", "path": "/courses/17442/sections/301", "id": "17442-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-008-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/17442/sections/301/reviews/592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "first_name": "FRANCIS B.", "last_name": "BREVART", "id": "592-FRANCIS-B--BREVART", "name": "FRANCIS B.
