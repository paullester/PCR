{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1330"}, "description": "In this course we will survey the political scandals in Germany from 1945 to the present. The German past, the division of Germany, and the unification are reflected in these political affairs. The seminar will survey the actors of political scandals: politicians, journalists, the media. Political scandals are an excellent means for understanding and comparing political cultures. For example, who cares in the US whether a politician dyes his hair? On the other hand, Monica Lewinsky would not have caused a scandal in France and Germany (and other European countries). In some countries, Enron would have cost the career of politicians. Thus political scandals tell us a lot about norms and norm violation. Not everything can be scandalized everywhere. It depends on the ever changing political culture to see what goes - and what doesn't. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "SEX, SPIES & VIDEOTAPE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1729/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "SEX, SPIES & VIDEOTAPE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-354-001", "path": "/courses/1729/sections/001", "id": "1729-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-354-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/1729/sections/001/reviews/597-SILKE-ROTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/597-SILKE-ROTH", "first_name": "SILKE", "last_name": "ROTH", "id": "597-SILKE-ROTH", "name": "SILKE ROTH"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "1729-001-597-SILKE-ROTH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-354", "path": "/courses/1729", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1729/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEX, SPIES & VIDEOTAPE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GRMN-354-001", "path": "/courses/1729/sections/001", "id": "1729-001", "aliases": ["GRMN-354-001"]}]}, "id": 1729, "aliases": ["GRMN-354"]}
