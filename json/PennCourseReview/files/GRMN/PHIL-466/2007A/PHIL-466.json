{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2895"}, "description": "This course is a study of Kant's moral and political philosophy. The central theme of the course is Kant's conviction that freedom or \"Autonomy\" is our most basic value, and that the fundamental law of morality as well as the more particular principles of both justice and personal virtue are the means that are necessary in order to preserve and promote the existence and exercise of human freedom. Central questions will be how Kant attempts to motivate or prove the fundamental value of freedom and the connection between this normative issue and his metaphysics of free will. Texts will include Kant's Lectures on Ethics, Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason, Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, and Metaphysics of Morals. Written work for the course will include one short paper and one term paper. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "KANT II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15003/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.08", "rRecommendMajor": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "KANT II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-466-401", "path": "/courses/15003/sections/401", "id": "15003-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-466-401", "GRMN-552-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/15003/sections/401/reviews/1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "first_name": "PAUL D", "last_name": "GUYER", "id": "1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "name": "PAUL D GUYER"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "15003-401-1670-PAUL-D-GUYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-466", "path": "/courses/15003", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15003/sections", "values": [{"name": "KANT II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-466-401", "path": "/courses/15003/sections/401", "id": "15003-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-466-401", "GRMN-552-401"]}]}, "id": 15003, "aliases": ["PHIL-466", "GRMN-552"]}
