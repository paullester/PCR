{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2564"}, "description": "This course looks at the information systems phenomena that are revolutionizing organizations (e.g., clicks & mortar shopping, net-centric value chains, telemedicine, emergent communities, online democracy, etc). To be effective in this milieu, organizations must do more than just push new information technology. They need to determine how to harness the new technology to manage complexity and to maximize stakeholder value. Processes need to be systematically analyzed and redesigned all along the value chain from supplies and procurement to electronic storefronts and customer support, from campaign headquarters to voter booth, etc. This course examines design principles task and information process modeling and analysis methodologies, and a range of underlying information technologies (e.g., webserver design, transaction processing, warehousing, datamining/knowledge management, bots and agents, XML, security, information theory/complexity, and more) that will help the modern organization or community to maximize its strategic objectives. We also examine failure case studies and derive lessons learned. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "INFO SYS FOR E-COMMERCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8884/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "2.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "2.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "2.64", "rInstructorQuality": "2.64"}, "section": {"name": "INFO SYS FOR E-COMMERCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-508-401", "path": "/courses/8884/sections/401", "id": "8884-401", "aliases": ["ESE-508-401", "OPIM-660-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/8884/sections/401/reviews/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "first_name": "BARRY G.", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "name": "BARRY G.
