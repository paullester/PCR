{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5115"}, "description": "This is an introductory course on packet networks and associated protocols that form the basis of today's communication infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on IP based networks such as the Internet. The course introduces the various design and implementation choices that are behind the development of modern networks, and emphasizes basic analytical understanding in motivating those choices. Topics are covered in a mostly \"bottom-up\" approach starting with a brief review of physical layer issues such as digital transmission, error correction and error recovery strategies . This is then followed by a discussion of link layer aspects, including multiple access control (MAC) strategies, local area networks (Ethernet, token rings, and 802.11 wireless LANs), and general store-and-forward packet switching. Network layer solutions, including IP addressing, naming, and routing are covered next, before exploring transport layer and congestion control soutions such as TCP. Finally, basic approaches for quality-of-service and network security are examined. Specific applications and aspects of data compression and streaming may also be covered. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "INTRO NETWRKS & PROTOCOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24367/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "1.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.33", "rCourseQuality": "1.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "1.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.75", "rCommAbility": "1.92", "rInstructorQuality": "2.11"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO NETWRKS & PROTOCOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-404-001", "path": "/courses/24367/sections/001", "id": "24367-001", "aliases": ["ESE-404-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/24367/sections/001/reviews/352-SASWATI-SARKAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/352-SASWATI-SARKAR", "first_name": "SASWATI", "last_name": "SARKAR", "id": "352-SASWATI-SARKAR", "name": "SASWATI SARKAR"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "24367-001-352-SASWATI-SARKAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-404", "path": "/courses/24367", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24367/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO NETWRKS & PROTOCOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-404-001", "path": "/courses/24367/sections/001", "id": "24367-001", "aliases": ["ESE-404-001"]}]}, "id": 24367, "aliases": ["ESE-404"]}
