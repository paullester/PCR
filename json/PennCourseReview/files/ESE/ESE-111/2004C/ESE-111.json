{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2543"}, "description": "This course is designed to provide first-year undergraduate students with an introduction to some key electrical engineering concepts and topics by discussing their roles in some of the commonly used electrical engineering systems such as telephone, TV, radio, computer, etc. Hands-on experience will be provided by laboratory projects such as line-tracking robot, half adder, and modulation. Numerical examples and graphics will be introduced through the use of MATLAB. This course, along with two companion courses (ESE 215 and ESE 216), is also a gateway course to electrical engineering and computer engineering and telecommunications options in the ESE undergraduate curriculum. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "INTRO ELEC/COMP/SYS ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5276/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.96", "rDifficulty": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "2.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.08", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.79", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO ELEC/COMP/SYS ENG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-111-001", "path": "/courses/5276/sections/001", "id": "5276-001", "aliases": ["ESE-111-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/5276/sections/001/reviews/1376-SOHRAB-RABII", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1376-SOHRAB-RABII", "first_name": "SOHRAB", "last_name": "RABII", "id": "1376-SOHRAB-RABII", "name": "SOHRAB RABII"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "5276-001-1376-SOHRAB-RABII"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-111", "path": "/courses/5276", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5276/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO ELEC/COMP/SYS ENG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-111-001", "path": "/courses/5276/sections/001", "id": "5276-001", "aliases": ["ESE-111-001"]}]}, "id": 5276, "aliases": ["ESE-111"]}
