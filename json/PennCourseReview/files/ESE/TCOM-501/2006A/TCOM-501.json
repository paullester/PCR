{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1114"}, "description": "Networks constitute an important component of modern technology and society. Networks have traditionally dominated communication technology in form of communication networks, distribution of energy in form of power grid networks, and have more recently emerged as a tool for social connectivity in form of social networks. In this course, we will study mathematical techniques that are key to the design and analysis of different kinds of networks. First, we will investigate techniques for modeling evolution of networks. Specifically, we will consider random graphs (all or none connectivity, size of components, diameters under random connectivity), small world problem, network formation and the role of topology in the evolution of networks. Next, we will investigate different kinds of stochastic processes that model the flow of information in networks. Specifically, we will develop the theory of markov processes, renewal processes, and basic queueing, diffusion models, epidemics and rumor spreading in networks. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "NETWKING THEORY & FUND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8412/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.80", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "NETWKING THEORY & FUND", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "TCOM-501-001", "path": "/courses/8412/sections/001", "id": "8412-001", "aliases": ["TCOM-501-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/8412/sections/001/reviews/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "first_name": "SANTOSH S", "last_name": "VENKATESH", "id": "1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "name": "SANTOSH S VENKATESH"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "8412-001-1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "TCOM-501", "path": "/courses/8412", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8412/sections", "values": [{"name": "NETWKING THEORY & FUND", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "TCOM-501-001", "path": "/courses/8412/sections/001", "id": "8412-001", "aliases": ["TCOM-501-001"]}]}, "id": 8412, "aliases": ["TCOM-501"]}
