This course is targeted at\r\nunderstanding and obtaining hands-on experience with the state-of-the-art in such\r\nwireless sensor networks which are often composed using relatively inexpensive sensor\r\nnodes that have low power consumption, low processing power and bandwidth. The\r\ncourse spans a variety of topics ranging from radio communications, network stack,\r\nsystems infrastructure including QoS support and energy management, programming\r\nparadigms, distributed algorithms and example applications. Some guest lectures may be\r\ngiven.\r\nStudents described this course as \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201crewarding.\u201d Many\r\nappreciated the \u201cawesome projects,\u201d in particular the final project. Their only complaint\r\nabout the final project was the time allotted. Exams were not given to allow for students\r\nto \u201cconcentrate on the projects.\u201d Students found this approach to be beneficial.\r\nStudents commonly felt that the class needed more structure. Professor Manghara\r\nwas not available to answer questions. Students were \u201cdisappointed with how [the class]\r\nwas conducted.\u201d\r\nOverall, students did not find the material too difficult, but they felt that\r\nhomework assignments were lengthy.
