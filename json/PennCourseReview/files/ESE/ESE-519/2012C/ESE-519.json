{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4566"}, "description": "The use of distributed wireless sensor networks has surged in popularity in recent years with applications ranging from environmental monitoring, to people- and object-tracking in both cooperative and hostile environments. This course is targeted at understanding and obtaining hands-on experience with the state-of-the-art in such wireless sensor networks which are often composed using relatively inexpensive sensor nodes that have low power consumption, low processing power and bandwidth. The course will span a variety of topics ranging from radio communications, network stack, systems infrastructure including QoS support and energy management, programming paradigms, distributed algorithms and example applications. Some guest lectures may be given. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "REAL TIME EMBEDDED SYS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28916/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.66", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rTAQuality": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.40", "rCommAbility": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "2.77"}, "section": {"name": "REAL TIME EMBEDDED SYS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-519-001", "path": "/courses/28916/sections/001", "id": "28916-001", "aliases": ["ESE-519-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/28916/sections/001/reviews/4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM", "first_name": "RAHUL", "last_name": "MANGHARAM", "id": "4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM", "name": "RAHUL MANGHARAM"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "28916-001-4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-519", "path": "/courses/28916", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28916/sections", "values": [{"name": "REAL TIME EMBEDDED SYS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-519-001", "path": "/courses/28916/sections/001", "id": "28916-001", "aliases": ["ESE-519-001"]}]}, "id": 28916, "aliases": ["ESE-519"]}
