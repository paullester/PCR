One student felt that Professor Mangharam assumed too much on what students already knew and were interested in \u201cwithout ever evaluating these assumptions.\u201d Many sections were \u201cvery under-explained\u201d, and exam material was not covered well. &#8232;&#8232;Students commented on the unreasonable workload, which included spending over 10 hours outside of class time a week to complete labs. Even more time was required for the final project, described by some as \u201cthoroughly ambitious.\u201d This course is required for majors and is not recommended for non-majors. &#8232;&#8232;This course review was based on the 8 student comments submitted.", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/21659/sections/001/reviews/4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM", "first_name": "RAHUL", "last_name": "MANGHARAM", "id": "4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM", "name": "RAHUL MANGHARAM"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "21659-001-4798-RAHUL-MANGHARAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-350", "path": "/courses/21659", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21659/sections", "values": [{"name": "EMBED SYS/MICROCONT LAB", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-350-001", "path": "/courses/21659/sections/001", "id": "21659-001", "aliases": ["ESE-350-001"]}]}, "id": 21659, "aliases": ["ESE-350"]}
