Concepts needed for building electronic systems for real-time operation and user interaction, such as digital input/outputs, interrupt service routines, serial communications, and analog-to-digital conversion are covered. The course concludes with a final project where student-designed projects are featured in presentations and demonstrations.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the class material was potentially very interesting and even \u201cfun\u201d, but was not explained in an engaging manner. The course was extremely disorganized; there was a lack of guidelines for the labs, exams, and final project. Example problems were useless because \u201cthe professor intentionally makes mistakes\u201d to prevent \u201ccopy[ing]\u201d. However, students did feel a sense of accomplishment from working on the final project.\r\n\r\nStudents found it difficult to understand Professor Mangharam\u2019s lectures, in which he \u201cprovides very little motivation\u201d to do so. One student felt that Professor Mangharam assumed too much on what students already knew and were interested in \u201cwithout ever evaluating these assumptions\u201d. Many sections were \u201cvery under-explained\u201d, and exam material was not covered well.\r\n\r\nStudents commented on the unreasonable workload, which included spending over 10 hours outside of class time a week to complete labs. Even more time was required for the final project, described as \u201cthoroughly ambitious\u201d. This course is required for majors, and is not recommended for non-majors.\r\n\r\nThis course review was based on the 8 student comments submitted.
