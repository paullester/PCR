The mathematical topics covered vary with the semester, but can include functions and signals, systems of differential equations, superpositions, memory, non-linearity, resonance, eigenfunctions, the Fourier series and transform, convergence theorems, inner product spaces, mean-square approximation, interpolation and prediction, sampling, stationarity, and Laplace transforms. Applications discussed also vary with the semester, but has included topics such as polynomial approximation, underwater communication, cryptography and secure communications, Brownian motion, and x-ray crystallography.\r\n\r\nMany students praised this class as \u201camazing\u201d and among the best at Penn. Some felt the course leaned too heavily towards theoretical mathematics, but most judged the class to be a good balance of theoretical background and engineering approach.\r\n\r\nProfessor Venkatesh was lauded as \u201cpassionate,\u201d talented, engaging, and \u201cone of the finest professors at the university.\u201d\r\nStudents highly respected his teaching ability regardless of their opinion of the coursework, and found his lectures to be interesting and applicable.\r\n\r\nStudents judged this course to be difficult and \u201ca lot of work\u201d \u2013 most felt the class was worth the effort, but some considered it too time-consuming. Some students would have preferred more problem-solving examples and more thorough explanations of mathematical material.", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/15705/sections/001/reviews/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "first_name": "SANTOSH S", "last_name": "VENKATESH", "id": "1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "name": "SANTOSH S VENKATESH"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "15705-001-1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH"}]
