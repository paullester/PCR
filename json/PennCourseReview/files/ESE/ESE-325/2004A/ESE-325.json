{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2804"}, "description": "This course focuses on the mathematics behind Fourier theory and a wide variety of its applicationsin diverse problems in mathematics, engineering, and the sciences. The course is very mathematical in content and students signing up for it should have junior or senior standing. The topics covered are chosen from: functions and signals; systems of differential equations; superposition,memory, and non-linearity; resonance,eigenfunctions; the Fourier series and transform, spectra; convergence theorems; inner product spaces; mean-square approximation; interpolation and prediction, sampling; random processes, stationarity; wavelets, Brownian motion; stability and control, Laplace transforms. \n\nThe applications of the mathematical theory that will be presented vary from year to year but a representative sample include: polynomial approximation, Weierstrass's theorem; efficient computation via Monte Carlo; linear and non-linear oscillators;the isoperimetric problem; the heat equation, underwate communication; the wave equation, tides; testing for randomness, fraud; nowhere differentiable continuous functions; does Brownian motion exist?; error-correction; phase conjugate optics and four-wave mixing; cryptography and secure communications; how fast can we compute?; X-ray crystallography; cosmology; and what the diffusion equation has to say about mathematical finance and arbitrage opportunities. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "SIGNALS & SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6495/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.41", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.12", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.24", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06"}, "section": {"name": "SIGNALS & SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-325-001", "path": "/courses/6495/sections/001", "id": "6495-001", "aliases": ["ESE-325-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/6495/sections/001/reviews/354-GEORGE-J--PAPPAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/354-GEORGE-J--PAPPAS", "first_name": "GEORGE J.", "last_name": "PAPPAS", "id": "354-GEORGE-J--PAPPAS", "name": "GEORGE J.
