Major themes include: formulating and abstracting problems, figures of merit (e.g. Energy, Delay, Throughput, Area, Mapping Time), representation, traditional decomposition of flow (logic optimization, covering, scheduling, retiming, assignment, partitioning, placement, routing), and techniques for solving problems (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming, search, (integer) linear programming, graph algorithms, randomization, satisfiability). \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ELEC DSGN AUTOM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21668/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.67", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "ELEC DSGN AUTOM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-535-001", "path": "/courses/21668/sections/001", "id": "21668-001", "aliases": ["ESE-535-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/21668/sections/001/reviews/4321-ANDRE-DEHON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4321-ANDRE-DEHON", "first_name": "ANDRE", "last_name": "DEHON", "id": "4321-ANDRE-DEHON", "name": "ANDRE DEHON"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "21668-001-4321-ANDRE-DEHON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-535", "path": "/courses/21668", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21668/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEC DSGN AUTOM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-535-001", "path": "/courses/21668/sections/001", "id": "21668-001", "aliases": ["ESE-535-001"]}]}, "id": 21668, "aliases": ["ESE-535"]}
