{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2556"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the basic processes for system design and engineering and examines the management of systems engineering projects. We first discuss the systems viewpoint and the systems engineering process. Next we examine issues relating to requirements specification and problem formulation. We highlight different methods for systems modeling and forecasting and for choosing among different system alternatives. The course also provides specific examples of systems engineering taken from the fields of telecommunications, manufacturing, environment/resource systems, and transportation. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13219/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-405", "path": "/courses/13219", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13219/sections", "values": [{"name": "SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-405-001", "path": "/courses/13219/sections/001", "id": "13219-001", "aliases": ["ESE-405-001"]}]}, "id": 13219, "aliases": ["ESE-405"]}
