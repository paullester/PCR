Student work will focus on completing the design undertaken in ESE 490 and successfully implementing the project. Success will be verified using experimental and/or simulation methods appropriate to the project that test the degree to which project objectives are achieved. Each project team will prepare a poster to support a final project presentation and demonstration to peers, faculty and external judges. The course will conclude with the submission of a final project written team report. During the semester there will be periodic project reviews with individual teams. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "SR DESIG PROJ II-SSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13224/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-491", "path": "/courses/13224", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13224/sections", "values": [{"name": "SR DESIG PROJ II-SSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-491-001", "path": "/courses/13224/sections/001", "id": "13224-001", "aliases": ["ESE-491-001"]}]}, "id": 13224, "aliases": ["ESE-491"]}
