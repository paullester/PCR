{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2561"}, "description": "This is the second of a two-term sequence in systems engineering senior design. Student work will focus on completing the design undertaken in ESE 490 and successfully implementing the project. Success will be verified using experimental and/or simulation methods appropriate to the project that test the degree to which project objectives are achieved. Each project team will prepare a poster to support a final project presentation and demonstration to peers, faculty and external judges. The course will conclude with the submission of a final project written team report. During the semester there will be periodic project reviews with individual teams. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "SR DESIG PROJ II-SSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8881/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.87", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "1.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.07", "rCourseQuality": "1.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "1.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.50", "rCommAbility": "1.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "SR DESIG PROJ II-SSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-491-001", "path": "/courses/8881/sections/001", "id": "8881-001", "aliases": ["ESE-491-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/8881/sections/001/reviews/1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "first_name": "IRAJ", "last_name": "ZANDI", "id": "1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "name": "IRAJ ZANDI"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "8881-001-1175-IRAJ-ZANDI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-491", "path": "/courses/8881", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8881/sections", "values": [{"name": "SR DESIG PROJ II-SSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-491-001", "path": "/courses/8881/sections/001", "id": "8881-001", "aliases": ["ESE-491-001"]}]}, "id": 8881, "aliases": ["ESE-491"]}
