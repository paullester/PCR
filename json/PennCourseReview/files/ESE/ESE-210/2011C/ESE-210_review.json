MATLAB is used extensively.\r\nStudents had mixed feelings regarding the course content. Some thought that it\r\nwas interesting, with \u201csome real world connections.\u201d One student called it \u201can excellent\r\nintroduction to the broad concepts of recursion and dynamic systems.\u201d Another student,\r\nhowever, pointed out that the course was so abstract that he would not know \u201chow to\r\napply these concepts to the real world.\u201d A majority of the class complained about the\r\nhomework, which wasn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily difficult\u201d, but \u201cimpossible to answer\u201d without TA\r\nhelp due to \u201cextremely convoluted\u201d and ambiguous wording.\r\nSeveral students were full of praise for the \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cresponsive\u201d TAs,\r\nwhose help was essential in completing the homework.
