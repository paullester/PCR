While most students found the class \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201cinteresting,\u201d many also found the course material to be \u201crepetitive\u201d and \u201cinapplicable\u201d to real-life scenarios, especially compared against Math 240.\r\n\r\nStudents found Dr. Keenan to be \u201centhusiastic\u201d and generally \u201chelpful and accessible.\u201d Students reported that Dr. Keenan\u2019s slides were generally more useful than the textbook or problem sets, but maintained that review sessions and in-class questions were generally helpful in preparing for exams, though homework was not always so.\r\n\r\nMany students reported being unsure why the course was incorporated as a requirement for the EE degree. All students were in either ESE or EE, and most students maintained that a lot of outside work was necessary to achieve success in the course. However, many students agreed that the homework assignments were generally not indicative of exam problems and also noted that practice tests had no solutions, making it sometimes difficult to study when it was not possible to go to review sessions. In general, the consensus seemed to be that the course was moderately difficult.", "num_students": 87, "path": "/courses/15697/sections/001/reviews/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "KEENAN", "id": "1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "name": "JOHN D KEENAN"}, "num_reviewers": 87, "id": "15697-001-1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-210", "path": "/courses/15697", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15697/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO DYNAMIC SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-210-001", "path": "/courses/15697/sections/001", "id": "15697-001", "aliases": ["ESE-210-001"]}]}, "id": 15697, "aliases": ["ESE-210"]}
