{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2546"}, "description": "This first course in systems modeling focuses on linear discrete-time systems. We draw on a set of examples used throughout the course as the necessary mathematical tools are developed. The examples demonstrate the breadth of systems models and are drawn from engineering, the biological sciences, and economics. MATLAB will be used extensively. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "INTRO TO DYNAMIC SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14443/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.07", "rDifficulty": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.73", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO DYNAMIC SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-210-001", "path": "/courses/14443/sections/001", "id": "14443-001", "aliases": ["ESE-210-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/14443/sections/001/reviews/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "KEENAN", "id": "1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "name": "JOHN D KEENAN"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "14443-001-1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-210", "path": "/courses/14443", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14443/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO DYNAMIC SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-210-001", "path": "/courses/14443/sections/001", "id": "14443-001", "aliases": ["ESE-210-001"]}]}, "id": 14443, "aliases": ["ESE-210"]}
