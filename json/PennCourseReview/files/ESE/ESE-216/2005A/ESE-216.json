{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2799"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to electric circuits that form the basis of modern microelectronic systems. After a brief discussion of power dissipation, the course will review passive and active filters. Laplace transforms will be used to analyze circuits and to represent network functions. The second half of the course will focus on moderns solid-state devices and elctronic circuits including diodes, the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOSFET) translator and hteir applications such as single stage MOS amplifiers. Use of state-of-the-art CAD packages such as SPICE will be introduced. The associated lab, ESE 206, is required for EE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10362/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.11", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.26", "rCourseQuality": "2.72", "rWorkRequired": "3.19", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09"}, "section": {"name": "ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-216-001", "path": "/courses/10362/sections/001", "id": "10362-001", "aliases": ["ESE-216-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/10362/sections/001/reviews/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "DER SPIEGEL", "id": "350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "name": "JAN DER SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "10362-001-350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-216", "path": "/courses/10362", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10362/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-216-001", "path": "/courses/10362/sections/001", "id": "10362-001", "aliases": ["ESE-216-001"]}]}, "id": 10362, "aliases": ["ESE-216"]}
