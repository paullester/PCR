{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2799"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to electric circuits that form the basis of modern microelectronic systems. After a brief discussion of electric power, the course will review passive and active filters, and frequency response of circuits. Laplace transforms will be used to analyze circuits and to represent network functions. The second half of the course will focus on modern solid-state devices and elctronic circuits including diodes, the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOSFET) translator and their applications such as single stage MOS amplifiers. Use of the state-of-the-art CAD packages such as SPICE will be introduced. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30254/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.29", "rDifficulty": "3.43", "rTAQuality": "1.57", "rStimulateInterest": "1.93", "rRecommendMajor": "2.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.57", "rInstructorAccess": "2.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.93", "rCommAbility": "2.07", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-216-001", "path": "/courses/30254/sections/001", "id": "30254-001", "aliases": ["ESE-216-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/30254/sections/001/reviews/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "DER SPIEGEL", "id": "350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "name": "JAN DER SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "30254-001-350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-216", "path": "/courses/30254", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30254/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-216-001", "path": "/courses/30254/sections/001", "id": "30254-001", "aliases": ["ESE-216-001"]}]}, "id": 30254, "aliases": ["ESE-216"]}
