{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2557"}, "description": "Design of analog circuits and subsystems using primarily MOS technologies at the transistor and higher levels. Transistor level design of building block circuits such as op amps, comparators, sample and hold circuits, voltage and current references, capacitors and resistor and class AB output stages. The Cadence Design System will be used to capture schematics and run simulations using Spectre for some homework problems and for the course project. Topics of stability, noise, device matching through good layout practice will also be covered. Students who take ESE419 will not be able to take ESE572 later. More will be expected of ESE572 students in the design project. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ANALOG INTEGRAT CIRCUITS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23036/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "2.85", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "2.45", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "ANALOG INTEGRAT CIRCUITS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-419-401", "path": "/courses/23036/sections/401", "id": "23036-401", "aliases": ["ESE-419-401", "ESE-572-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/23036/sections/401/reviews/2469-DALE-H--NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2469-DALE-H--NELSON", "first_name": "DALE H.", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "2469-DALE-H--NELSON", "name": "DALE H.
