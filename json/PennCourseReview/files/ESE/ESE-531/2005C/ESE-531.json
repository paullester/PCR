{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2569"}, "description": "This course covers the fundamentals of discrete-time signals and systems and digital filters. Specific topics covered include: review of discrete-time signal and linear system representations in the time and frequence domain, and convolution; discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT); Z-transforms; frequency response of linear discrete-time systems; sampling of continuous-time signals, analog to digital conversion, sampling-rate conversion; basic discrete-time filter structures and types; finite imples response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters; design of FIR and IIR filters; discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and its applications in filtering and spectrum estimation. Selected applications. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "DIGITAL SIGNAL PROC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11792/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.62", "rDifficulty": "3.15", "rStimulateInterest": "1.85", "rRecommendMajor": "2.77", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.19", "rInstructorAccess": "2.62", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.42", "rCommAbility": "2.12", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL SIGNAL PROC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-531-001", "path": "/courses/11792/sections/001", "id": "11792-001", "aliases": ["ESE-531-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/11792/sections/001/reviews/2471-QINQING-ZHANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2471-QINQING-ZHANG", "first_name": "QINQING", "last_name": "ZHANG", "id": "2471-QINQING-ZHANG", "name": "QINQING ZHANG"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "11792-001-2471-QINQING-ZHANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-531", "path": "/courses/11792", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11792/sections", "values": [{"name": "DIGITAL SIGNAL PROC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-531-001", "path": "/courses/11792/sections/001", "id": "11792-001", "aliases": ["ESE-531-001"]}]}, "id": 11792, "aliases": ["ESE-531"]}
