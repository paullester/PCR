{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2569"}, "description": "This course covers the fundamentals of discrete-time signals and systems and digital filters. Specific topics covered include: review of discrete-time signal and linear system representations in the time and frequence domain, and convolution; discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT); Z-transforms; frequency response of linear discrete-time systems; sampling of continuous-time signals, analog to digital conversion, sampling-rate conversion; basic discrete-time filter structures and types; finite imples response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters; design of FIR and IIR filters; discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and its applications in filtering and spectrum estimation. Selected applications. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "DIGITAL SIGNAL PROC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13232/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "3.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "2.96", "rCourseQuality": "2.72", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.68", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.32", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL SIGNAL PROC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-531-001", "path": "/courses/13232/sections/001", "id": "13232-001", "aliases": ["ESE-531-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/13232/sections/001/reviews/358-SALEEM-A-KASSAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/358-SALEEM-A-KASSAM", "first_name": "SALEEM A", "last_name": "KASSAM", "id": "358-SALEEM-A-KASSAM", "name": "SALEEM A KASSAM"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "13232-001-358-SALEEM-A-KASSAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-531", "path": "/courses/13232", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13232/sections", "values": [{"name": "DIGITAL SIGNAL PROC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-531-001", "path": "/courses/13232/sections/001", "id": "13232-001", "aliases": ["ESE-531-001"]}]}, "id": 13232, "aliases": ["ESE-531"]}
