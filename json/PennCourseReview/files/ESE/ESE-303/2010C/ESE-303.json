{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2550"}, "description": "Stochastic systems analysis and simulation (ESE 303) is a class that explores stochastic systems which we could loosely define as anything random that changes in time. Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering, for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere, including social systems, markets, molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model, analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments. \n\nThe class's material is divided in four blocks respectively dealing with Markov chains, continuous time Markov chains, Gaussian processes and stationary processes. Emphasis is placed in the development of toolboxes to analyze these different classes of processes and on describing their applications to complex stochastic systems in different disciplines. Particular examples include: (i) the problem of ranking web pages by a search engine; (ii) the study of reputation and trust in social networks; (iii) modeling and analysis of communication networks; (iv) the use of queues in the modeling of transportation networks; (v) stochastic modeling and simulation of biochemical reactions and gene networks; (vi) arbitrages, pricing of stocks, and pricing of options through Black-Scholes formula; and (vii) linear filtering of stochastic processes to separate signals of interest from background noise.

Ross is used as the textbook for the class.\r\n\r\nMany students enjoyed the course, although some students thought that lecture focused too much on PowerPoint slides. Some students found that the course tried to cover too much material and that they were unsure what the most important topics were. One student reported, \u201cthis really was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Penn.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Ribeiro was generally positively regarded. Students reported that the professor and his lectures were of \u201cexcellent quality.\u201d However, other students reported that he could be \u201ccondescending\u201d at times. Furthermore, some students found that Professor Ribeiro \u201ctaught the course in a manner which is very difficult for students to comprehend.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is a junior level class, although some sophomores and seniors elect to take it as well. Most students found the class to be \u201clots of work.\u201d However, students generally found that the course load was manageable once they grasped the topics covered in class.\r\n", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/23027/sections/001/reviews/4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO", "first_name": "ALEJANDRO", "last_name": "RIBEIRO", "id": "4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO", "name": "ALEJANDRO RIBEIRO"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "23027-001-4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-303", "path": "/courses/23027", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23027/sections", "values": [{"name": "STOCH SYS ANALYSIS SIMUL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-303-001", "path": "/courses/23027/sections/001", "id": "23027-001", "aliases": ["ESE-303-001"]}]}, "id": 23027, "aliases": ["ESE-303"]}
