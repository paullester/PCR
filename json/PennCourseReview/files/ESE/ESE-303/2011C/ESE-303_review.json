Some areas of\r\napplication include: queuing systems, inventory systems, reliability systems and Monte-\r\nCarlo systems. The course examines many of the discrete and continuous probability\r\ndistributions used in simulation studies as well as the Poisson process. Long-run\r\nmeasurements of performances of queuing systems, steady-state behavior of infinite and\r\nfinite-population queuing systems and network of queues are also examined.\r\nFundamental to most simulation studies is the ability to generate reliable random\r\nnumbers. The course investigates the basic properties of random numbers and techniques\r\nused for the generation of pseudo-random numbers. In addition, the course examines\r\ntechniques used to test pseudo-random numbers for uniformity and independence. These\r\ninclude the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squired tests, runs tests, gap tests, and poker\r\ntests. Random numbers are used to generate random samples and the course examines the\r\ninverse-transform, convolution, composition and acceptance/rejection methods for the\r\ngeneration of random samples for many different types of probability distributions.\r\nFinally, since most inputs to simulation are probabilistic instead of deterministic in\r\nnature, the course examines some techniques used for identifying the probabilistic nature\r\nof input data. These include identifying distributional families with sample data, then\r\nusing maximum-likelihood methods for parameter estimating within a given family and\r\nthen testing the final choice of distribution using chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests.\r\nStudents found this class to be \u201cvery useful\u201d and enjoyed the broad applicability\r\nof the materials taught. The homework and exams were described as \u201cfair.\u201d However, a\r\nfew students commented that the class felt rushed towards the end and wished there were\r\npractice problems for the final exam.\r\nProfessor Robeiro was generally well-liked. Students appreciated his flexibility\r\nregarding late assignments and described him as an \u201cawesome guy.\u201d Some students did\r\nnot like the fact that he randomly called on students to answer questions in class.\r\nThis course was described as \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201cintimidating.\u201d A working\r\nknowledge of MATLAB was required to complete the \u201clengthy\u201d problem sets. A good\r\ngrasp of probability and programming was also recommended. Despite its difficulty,\r\nstudents recommended this class to both majors and non-majors alike.", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/24361/sections/001/reviews/4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO", "first_name": "ALEJANDRO", "last_name": "RIBEIRO", "id": "4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO", "name": "ALEJANDRO RIBEIRO"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "24361-001-4320-ALEJANDRO-RIBEIRO"}]
