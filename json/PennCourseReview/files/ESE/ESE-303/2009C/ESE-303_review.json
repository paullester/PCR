Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering, for example communication systems and machine learning. The goal of the class is to learn how to model, analyze and simulate stochastic systems.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course to be challenging, but extremely rewarding in terms of the content covered. One student noted that the course \u201cliterally changed the way I view the world.\u201d Students stated that the amount of knowledge gained was \u201ctremendous.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents greatly enjoyed having Professor Ribeiro as their instructor. They stated that not only was he enthusiastic and passionate, but also a scholar in the field who was extremely knowledgeable. Students also appreciated his \u201cgenuine sincerity and willingness to help,\u201d along with his availability.\r\n\r\nThe course was found by many students to be extremely difficult and time consuming.
