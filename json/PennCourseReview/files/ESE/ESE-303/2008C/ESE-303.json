{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2550"}, "description": "Stochastic systems analysis and simulation (ESE 303) is a class that explores stochastic systems which we could loosely define as anything random that changes in time. Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering, for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere, including social systems, markets, molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model, analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments. \n\nThe class's material is divided in four blocks respectively dealing with Markov chains, continuous time Markov chains, Gaussian processes and stationary processes. Emphasis is placed in the development of toolboxes to analyze these different classes of processes and on describing their applications to complex stochastic systems in different disciplines. Particular examples include: (i) the problem of ranking web pages by a search engine; (ii) the study of reputation and trust in social networks; (iii) modeling and analysis of communication networks; (iv) the use of queues in the modeling of transportation networks; (v) stochastic modeling and simulation of biochemical reactions and gene networks; (vi) arbitrages, pricing of stocks, and pricing of options through Black-Scholes formula; and (vii) linear filtering of stochastic processes to separate signals of interest from background noise.

The course covers the Poisson process, empirical distributions, and measurements of performances of different systems. A large portion of the course is also devoted to the properties and generation of random and pseudo-random numbers. The required textbook is called Discrete-Event System Simulation and Professor Carchidi also posted class notes on Blackboard.\r\n\r\nOverall, students were very happy with the content covered in the course. Many found it very enjoyable and useful, calling lectures \u201cthorough\u201d and \u201corganized.\u201d However, some students called for greater use of examples in lectures and class notes to better explain some of the concepts.\r\n\r\nStudents praised Professor Carchidi and his teaching abilities. Although his lectures were not extremely stimulating, almost all students indicated that he expressed great interest in their performance. He held extensive office hours and was very accessible to all students. His notes were also very extensive and helpful.\r\n\r\nThis course is designed for undergraduates and ESE 301 or an equivalent probability and statistics course is listed as a prerequisite. Students found the workload fairly high but manageable. The homework assignments did a good job emphasizing the concepts explained in class.", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/18634/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
