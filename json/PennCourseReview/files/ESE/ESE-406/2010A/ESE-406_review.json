Methods presented include time response analysis, frequency response analysis, root locus, Nyquist and Bode plots, and the state-space approach.\r\n\r\nStudents praised this course as a \u201cvery good course of being exposed to undergraduate level control theory.\u201d Graduate students noted that it helped \u201clay a good foundation\u201d for future graduate level controls courses.\r\n\r\nStudents noted that Professor Kothmann\u2019s \u201centhusiasm for the subject is commendable \u2013 he is extremely approachable and helpful.\u201d One student noted that he \u201ctakes great pain to explain the practical meaning of every single equation.\u201d Another noted that he does \u201ca good job of connecting theory back to real-life examples.\u201d Several students noted that you could quickly be left behind; however, he is very open to questions and emails.\r\n\r\nMany students had difficulty with the cross listing of the class as both graduate and undergraduate. Students thought that this course should be required for MEAM and ESE majors alike. However, some thought that there were too many mechanical engineering examples and thought that the course should focus more on electrical engineering.
