Applications to practical systems. Methods presented include time response analysis, frequency response analysis, root locus, Nyquist and Bode plots, and the state-space approach. It is also an overview of the communication process, frequency response of linear channels, random processes and power spectral densities, modulation and noise, baseband data transmission (pulse amplitude modulation, inter-symbol interference, and equalization, performance in noise, digital band-pass modulation (PSK, QAM, FSK), and elements of information theory. &#8232;&#8232;Students generally enjoyed the content of the class and felt that the knowledge gained was \u201capplicable to practical situations.\u201d One student felt that an effort was needed to \u201cfigure out how the concepts learned translated\u201d to the field, and another felt that it was a good foundation for graduate courses. Systems engineering majors felt that the course was more relevant for electrical engineers and should not be a requirement for them. &#8232;&#8232;Students commended Professor Kothmann on his teaching, saying that he was \u201cexcellent at stimulating interest\u201d and \u201ctakes pains to explain the practical meaning of every single equation.\u201d He was also \u201cvery open to emails and questions.\u201d However, some felt that his teaching style often caused them to \u201cquickly get left behind.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;Most students took the course as a requirement for Systems/Electrical Engineering.
