{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2572"}, "description": "This course covers the methodologies and techniques important to DESIGNING large complex, purposeful systems and to discovering policies that influence them throughout the stages of their lifecycle. The course focuses on hands-on synthetic thinking, where students assemble the big picture from modeling the individual actors, organizations, and artifacts in a socio-technical system of interest. This is the study of emergence of macro-behavior from the micro-decision making of the actors involved - to inquire into the design of a purposeful system, and to examine alternative futures that are ideal, yet affordable, sustainable, and workable. Specifically, the student learns systems theory, systems methodologies (design inquiry/learning systems, idealized design/interactive planning, and soft systems methodology/knowledge management), bottom up modeling (decision science, multi-attribute utility theory, affective reasoning, agent based modeling, simulated societies), and how to further research and apply the synthetic paradigm. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27378/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.53", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "1.88", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "2.12", "rInstructorQuality": "2.22"}, "section": {"name": "SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-590-001", "path": "/courses/27378/sections/001", "id": "27378-001", "aliases": ["ESE-590-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/27378/sections/001/reviews/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "first_name": "BARRY G.", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "name": "BARRY G.
