{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2545"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to modern logic design and digital systems. It starts with an overview of the major building blocks of a computer. It covers combinational logic including logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices such as programmable logic arrays. The next part deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, regist memories, and state machines. Case studies of real-world applications are used to illustrate the design of sequential circuits. The use of hardware description language will be introduced. There is a companion lab-based course, ESE 201, required for EE/CTE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18628/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-200", "path": "/courses/18628", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18628/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-200-001", "path": "/courses/18628/sections/001", "id": "18628-001", "aliases": ["ESE-200-001"]}]}, "id": 18628, "aliases": ["ESE-200"]}
