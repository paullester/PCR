{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2545"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to modern logic design and digital systems. It starts with an overview of the major building blocks of a computer. It covers combinational logic including logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices such as programmable logic arrays. The next part deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, regist memories, and state machines. Case studies of real-world applications are used to illustrate the design of sequential circuits. The use of hardware description language will be introduced. There is a companion lab-based course, ESE 201, required for EE/CTE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13207/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.55", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.79", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.59", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.88", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorQuality": "3.94"}, "section": {"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-200-001", "path": "/courses/13207/sections/001", "id": "13207-001", "aliases": ["ESE-200-001"]}, "comments": "Students describe Professor Van der Spiegel as \u201ca fantastic teacher who makes any class worthwhile.\u201d  The same enthusiasm was not extended to the TA.
