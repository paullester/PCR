{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2545"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to modern logic design and digital systems. It starts with an overview of the major building blocks of a computer. It covers combinational logic including logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices such as programmable logic arrays. The next part deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, regist memories, and state machines. Case studies of real-world applications are used to illustrate the design of sequential circuits. The use of hardware description language will be introduced. There is a companion lab-based course, ESE 201, required for EE/CTE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11767/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.93", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.59"}, "section": {"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-200-001", "path": "/courses/11767/sections/001", "id": "11767-001", "aliases": ["ESE-200-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/11767/sections/001/reviews/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "DER SPIEGEL", "id": "350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "name": "JAN DER SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "11767-001-350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-200", "path": "/courses/11767", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11767/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-200-001", "path": "/courses/11767/sections/001", "id": "11767-001", "aliases": ["ESE-200-001"]}]}, "id": 11767, "aliases": ["ESE-200"]}
