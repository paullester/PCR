{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2545"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to modern logic design and digital systems. It starts with an overview of the major building blocks of a computer. It covers combinational logic including logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices such as programmable logic arrays. The next part deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, regist memories, and state machines. Case studies of real-world applications are used to illustrate the design of sequential circuits. The use of hardware description language will be introduced. There is a companion lab-based course, ESE 201, required for EE/CTE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25979/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.18", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.61", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "3.48", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-200-001", "path": "/courses/25979/sections/001", "id": "25979-001", "aliases": ["ESE-200-001"]}, "comments": "This course provides an introduction to modern logic design and digital systems.

While some students claimed \u201cit wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d others protested that there was \u201ctoo much.\u201d Overall, the course was recommended for Majors in electrical engineering. For students who are considering this course, the companion lab-based course, ESE 171 is highly recommended.
