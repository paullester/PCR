We emphasize the process of problem conception, engineering design, project implementation, and long-term operation as essential components of what we as engineers do. The course also focuses on the life-cycle approach to large-scale complex systems design, and will incorporate case studies, group projects, and technical communications.\r\n\r\nOverall, many students enjoyed this course. Many thought the course served as a \u201creally good foundation for systems engineering\u201d. Many praised it as a \u201cgreat introductory course\u201d to \u201cexplore what systems engineering is all about.\u201d Underclassmen reported learning a lot from this course. However, students with more experience in the major found this course to be often repetitive, becoming \u201ctoo easy.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Keenan was praised as a \u201cgreat professor.\u201d However, many students wished that he had provided more guidance on course assignments, in particular more feedback on homework and more detailed instructions on the final paper.\r\n\r\nMany students were concerned with the lack of clear guidelines in reference to paper and presentation requirements. In addition, many students did not know where they stood in the class or how to improve. The class is targeted towards freshman and sophomores to be an introductory survey of systems engineering, however, one junior in the course noted that it provided a \u201cgreat background for Senior Design.\u201d ", "num_students": 80, "path": "/courses/25981/sections/001/reviews/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "KEENAN", "id": "1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "name": "JOHN D KEENAN"}, "num_reviewers": 79, "id": "25981-001-1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN"}]
