We emphasize the process of problem conception, engineering design, project implementation, and long-term operation as essential components of what we as engineerings do. The course also focuses on the life-cycle approach to large-scale complex systems design, and will incorporate case studies, group projects, and technical communications. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SYS METHODOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21647/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.25", "rDifficulty": "2.28", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "2.95", "rCourseQuality": "2.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SYS METHODOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-204-001", "path": "/courses/21647/sections/001", "id": "21647-001", "aliases": ["ESE-204-001"]}, "comments": "ESE204, officially titled \u201cSystems Methodology,\u201d introduces students to the integrative methodology that engineers use to solve complex problems.
