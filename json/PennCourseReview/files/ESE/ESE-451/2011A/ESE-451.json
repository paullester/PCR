{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4948"}, "description": "This is the second of a two term sequence in electrical and systems engineering senior design. Student work will focus on completing the design undertaken in ESE 450 and successfully implementing the project. Success will be verified using experimental and/or simulation methods appropriate to the project that test the degree to which the project objectives are achieved. Each project team will prepare a posted to support a final project presentation and demonstration to peers, faculty and external judges. Teh coruse will conclude with the submission of a final project written team report. During the semester there will be periodic project reviews with individual teams. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SR DESIGN PROJ II-EE/SSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21664/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.50", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "0.63", "rRecommendMajor": "1.88", "rCourseQuality": "1.22", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "1.63", "rReadingsValue": "1.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.38", "rCommAbility": "0.88", "rInstructorQuality": "0.56"}, "section": {"name": "SR DESIGN PROJ II-EE/SSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-451-001", "path": "/courses/21664/sections/001", "id": "21664-001", "aliases": ["ESE-451-001"]}, "comments": "ESE451 is the second semester of Electrical and Systems Engineering senior design.
