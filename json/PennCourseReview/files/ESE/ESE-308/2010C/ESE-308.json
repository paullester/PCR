{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3878"}, "description": "Agents are a new technique for trying to model, simulate, and understand systems that are ill-structured and whose mathematics is initially unknown and possibly unknowable. This approach allows the analyst to assemble models of agents and components where micro-decision rules may be understood; to bring the agents and components together as a system where macro-behavior then emerges; and to use that to empirically probe and improve understanding of the whole, the interrelations of the components, and synergies. This approach helps one explore parametrics, causality, and what-ifs about socio-technical systems (technologies that must support people, groups, crowds, organizations, and societies). It is applicable when trying to model and understand human behavior -- consumers, investors , passengers, plant operators, patients, voters, political leaders, terrorists, and so on. This course will allow students to investigate and compare increasingly complex agent based paradigms along three lines - math foundations, heuristic algorithms/knowledge representations, and empirical science. The student will gain a toolbox and methodology for attempting to represent and study complex socio-technical systems. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "AGENT-BASED MOD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23029/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.80", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "0.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "1.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "1.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "1.86"}, "section": {"name": "AGENT-BASED MOD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-308-001", "path": "/courses/23029/sections/001", "id": "23029-001", "aliases": ["ESE-308-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/23029/sections/001/reviews/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "first_name": "BARRY G.", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "name": "BARRY G.
