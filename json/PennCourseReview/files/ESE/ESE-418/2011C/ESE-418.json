{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5215"}, "description": "This is a senior level course on scientific and technological fundamentals as they apply to two of the most utilized energy storage device systems, the electrochemical batteries and super-capacitors. The student will be taught how simple galvanic cells in series gave origin to those ubiquitous devices that combined excel in both power and energe density. The course will introduce the student to the modes of electrical energy storage by battieries and capacitors, different categories of electrochemical cells and batteries, primary and rechargeable batteries and their related chemistry, kinds of super-capacitors, charging and discharging profiles, equivalent series resistance (ESR), power capacities, and lifetimes. \n\nFor super-capacitors, the student will be introduced to double-layer capacitance (DLC) and psuedo-capacitance types of energy storage, super-capacitor fundamentals through Faradaic and non-Faradaic processes, pseudo-capacitance of mental oxides and electro-active polymers (EAPs), non-ideal polarizable electrodes, energetics and kinetics of electrode processes, theories of dielectric polarization, inorganic and organic electolytes, carbonaceous materials, effective surface area (ESA) and functionalizations. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ELEC ENERGY STORAGE SYS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24369/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "ELEC ENERGY STORAGE SYS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-418-001", "path": "/courses/24369/sections/001", "id": "24369-001", "aliases": ["ESE-418-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/24369/sections/001/reviews/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "first_name": "JORGE JUAN", "last_name": "SANTIAGO", "id": "349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "name": "JORGE JUAN SANTIAGO"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "24369-001-349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-418", "path": "/courses/24369", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24369/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEC ENERGY STORAGE SYS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-418-001", "path": "/courses/24369/sections/001", "id": "24369-001", "aliases": ["ESE-418-001"]}]}, "id": 24369, "aliases": ["ESE-418"]}
