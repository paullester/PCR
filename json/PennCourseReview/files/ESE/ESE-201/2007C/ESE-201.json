{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3378"}, "description": "This is the companion course for ESE 200 and provides hands-on experience in modern digital circuit design. It makes use of state-of-the-art computer-aided design software including schematic capture, behavioral description, logic-simulation, minimization and implementation tools. The students will get familiar with programmable logic devices and hardware description languages (VHDL). The lab experiments make use of Xilinx FPGAs which allow rapid implementation and testing of the designed circuits. The course consists of weekly 3-hour laboratory sessions. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "PRIN OF DIG DESIGN LAB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13208/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.90", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "PRIN OF DIG DESIGN LAB", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "ESE-201-101", "path": "/courses/13208/sections/101", "id": "13208-101", "aliases": ["ESE-201-101"]}, "comments": "Reviews of the professor and material were generally positive.
