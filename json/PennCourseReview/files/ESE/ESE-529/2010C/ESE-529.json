One student described it as a \u201cpretty basic introduction\u201d to the subject material and stated that it would not be as enjoyable if it was taken just to fulfill the requirement. The final project was a good way to sum up the curriculum of the course.\r\n\r\nOverall, students were satisfied with Professor Piazza, but one student felt that he needed to better ensure that everyone in class could follow his lecturing.\r\n\r\nThere were five homework assignments, which were weighted differently, the latter three being based on in-class demos. In addition, there was a midterm examination and a final group project.\r\n\r\nThis course review is based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/23046/sections/401/reviews/3295-GIANLUCA-PIAZZA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3295-GIANLUCA-PIAZZA", "first_name": "GIANLUCA", "last_name": "PIAZZA", "id": "3295-GIANLUCA-PIAZZA", "name": "GIANLUCA PIAZZA"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "23046-401-3295-GIANLUCA-PIAZZA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-529", "path": "/courses/23046", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23046/sections", "values": [{"name": "RF MEMS AND NEMS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-529-401", "path": "/courses/23046/sections/401", "id": "23046-401", "aliases": ["ESE-529-401", "MEAM-529-401"]}]}, "id": 23046, "aliases": ["ESE-529", "MEAM-529"]}
