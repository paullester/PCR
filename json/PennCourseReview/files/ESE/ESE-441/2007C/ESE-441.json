{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2558"}, "description": "This is the first of a two-semester sequence in electrical engineering senior design. Student work will focus on project/team definition, systems analysis, identification alternative design strategies and determination (experimental or by simualtion) of specifications necessary for a detailed design. Students will receive guidance on preparing professinal written and oral presentations. Each project team will submit a project proposal and two written project reports that include coherent technical presentations, block diagrams and other illustrations appropriate to the project, a budget and team schedule with sufficient detal and granularity to enable close management of the project. Each student will deliver two formal Powerpoint presentations to an audience comprised of peers, instructors and project advisors. During the semester there will be periodic individual-team project reviews. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "SR DESIGN PROJ I-EE/CTE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13221/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.90", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "1.10", "rRecommendMajor": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "1.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "1.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.50", "rCommAbility": "1.80", "rInstructorQuality": "1.70"}, "section": {"name": "SR DESIGN PROJ I-EE/CTE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-441-001", "path": "/courses/13221/sections/001", "id": "13221-001", "aliases": ["ESE-441-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/13221/sections/001/reviews/3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "MAGERMAN", "id": "3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN", "name": "DAVID MAGERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "13221-001-3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.14", "rDifficulty": "3.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.14", "rWorkRequired": "3.86", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "2.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.21", "rCommAbility": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "SR DESIGN PROJ I-EE/CTE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ESE-441-002", "path": "/courses/13221/sections/002", "id": "13221-002", "aliases": ["ESE-441-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/13221/sections/002/reviews/3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "MAGERMAN", "id": "3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN", "name": "DAVID MAGERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "13221-002-3293-DAVID-MAGERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-441", "path": "/courses/13221", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13221/sections", "values": [{"name": "SR DESIGN PROJ I-EE/CTE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-441-001", "path": "/courses/13221/sections/001", "id": "13221-001", "aliases": ["ESE-441-001"]}, {"name": "SR DESIGN PROJ I-EE/CTE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ESE-441-002", "path": "/courses/13221/sections/002", "id": "13221-002", "aliases": ["ESE-441-002"]}]}, "id": 13221, "aliases": ["ESE-441"]}
