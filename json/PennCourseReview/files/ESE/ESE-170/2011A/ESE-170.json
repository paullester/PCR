{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4943"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to modern logic design and digital systems. It starts with an overview of the major building blocks of a computer. It covers combinational logic including logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices such as programmable logic arrays. The next part deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, registers memories, and state machines. Case studies of real-world applications are used to illustrate the design of sequential circuits. The use of hardware description language will be introduced. There is a companion lab-based course, ESE 171, required for EE/CMPE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21645/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.03", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "2.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.02"}, "section": {"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-170-001", "path": "/courses/21645/sections/001", "id": "21645-001", "aliases": ["ESE-170-001"]}, "comments": "This course introduces modern logic design and digital systems.

He was very knowledgeable, \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201csincerely cared about his students\u2019 success.\u201d Students also liked how Professor Van der Spiegel incorporated several examples throughout his lectures and how he printed out slides for all of his students every lecture. Students claimed that they could not help but share Professor Van der Spiegel\u2019s excitement about the course material. &#8232;&#8232;This course was considered by students to be relatively difficult and required a lot of time to complete the homework assignments. Nevertheless, students expressed that this course was an \u201cideal introduction to digital logic\u201d for anyone who was interested. This course is usually taken by freshmen in Electrical & Systems Engineering, but is open to all students who are interested in the material.", "num_students": 50, "path": "/courses/21645/sections/001/reviews/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "DER SPIEGEL", "id": "350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "name": "JAN DER SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 45, "id": "21645-001-350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-170", "path": "/courses/21645", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21645/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-170-001", "path": "/courses/21645/sections/001", "id": "21645-001", "aliases": ["ESE-170-001"]}]}, "id": 21645, "aliases": ["ESE-170"]}
