Students thought that\r\n\"the course was useful \u2026 I learned a lot about how to formulate and solve problems.\"\r\nOne student surmised that the \"course material is a bit dry, but straightforward and easy\r\nto grasp when enough effort is put in.\"\r\nNot much was said about the professor except that the notes he gave to the class\r\nwere re-written notes from the Handbook. His notes were more confusing than the\r\nHandbook, which was very well-written and very good. Therefore, some students felt\r\nthat they did not need to attend class and get the notes, as long as you learned from the\r\nHandbook. It was useful that the professor laid out everything for the course beforehand.\r\nHomework sets and quizzes were given in this class. The homework was a good\r\ndepiction of the exam questions and the quizzes was not relevant to the material from the\r\nhomework set. The Handbook for the class is thought to be an excellent guide for this\r\ncourse.", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/27364/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
