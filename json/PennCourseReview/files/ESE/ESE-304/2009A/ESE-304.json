Many students felt that they learned real life applications of conceptual ideas in class, though time was dedicated to only a few core examples rather than multiple case studies.\r\n\r\nMany students praised Dr. Carchidi\u2019s availability, approachability, and comprehensiveness, especially in his notes. Students cited Dr. Carchidi as having particularly plentiful office hours and creating excellent notes that at times \u201cserved to replace the text.\u201d Students did, however, express that lectures seemed to be presentations of the notes, rather than going beyond the already comprehensive notes.\r\n\r\nSome students, all of whom seem to have been in ESE, felt that the course was conceptually difficult, but that the homeworks paralleled the exams.
