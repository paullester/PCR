By the end of the semester, students can expect to have a solid grasp in packages, degeneracies, minimization and the BigM and the Two-Phase Methods, and Goal Programming. Sensitivity Analysis and Shadow Prices are also covered, along with numerous programming methods (the branch and bound method, enumeration methods, and cutting plane method). A review of differential calculus and an introduction to nonlinear optimization are also major components of the class syllabus. \r\n\r\nA majority of students found this class to be enjoyable, noting that many aspects had \u201creal-world applications.\u201d Students generally highly praised Professor Carchidi\u2019s notes, saying that they \u201cserve as a replacement for the textbook.\u201d One student commented that the professor was \u201cnot sure how necessary class attendance really was, as the notes are extremely comprehensive.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, students seemed to agree that Professor Carchidi was an \u201cexcellent\u201d professor \u2013 one who \u201cdid an excellent job of taking the time to ensure that all students were comfortable with the material.\u201d Although students tended to find his lectures \u201cdry\u201d and sometimes \u201cboring,\u201d many commented on how Professor Carchidi\u2019s office hours \u201cwere so numerous [that] it was fairly easy to get in contact with him to discuss the problems.\u201d Students generally wished that his lectures were more \u201cengaging;\u201d however, most believed that Professor Carchidi taught the material well and felt that they had learned something by the end of the course. \r\n\r\nThe class notes supplied by Professor Carchidi were very \u201chelpful\u201d and \u201cbeneficial,\u201d according to some students. One student stated, \u201cconcepts in examinations are easy, but computations are sometimes tedious and lengthy. Thus, a student's grade on any particular examination [is determined] by how good he/she is at performing numerous arithmetic operations in a short amount of time instead of by his/her overall knowledge of the material.\u201d The class had a \u201chigh learning curve\u201d and the homework assignments were usually based off the previous chapter. Overall, students believed that \u201cexams were not too bad if you can understand the homework assignments, since they followed the same format.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/23028/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
