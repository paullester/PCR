{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3636"}, "description": "An advanced undergraduate course or graduate level course on the fundamental physical principles underlying the operation of traditional semiconducting electronic and optoelectronic devices and extends these concepts to novel nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices. The course assumes an undergraduate level understanding of semiconductors physics, as found in ESE 218 or PHYS 240. The course builds on the physics of solid state semiconductor devices to develop the operation and application of semiconductors and their devices in energy conversion devices such as solar photovoltaics, thermophotovoltaics, and thermoelectrics, to supply energy. The course also considers the importance of the design of modern semiconductor transistor technology to operate at low-power in CMOS. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SEMICON DEVICE PHYS&TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21667/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.96", "rStimulateInterest": "2.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.04", "rWorkRequired": "2.96", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "2.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.19", "rCommAbility": "2.96", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "SEMICON DEVICE PHYS&TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-521-001", "path": "/courses/21667/sections/001", "id": "21667-001", "aliases": ["ESE-521-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/21667/sections/001/reviews/3961-CHERIE-R--KAGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3961-CHERIE-R--KAGAN", "first_name": "CHERIE R.", "last_name": "KAGAN", "id": "3961-CHERIE-R--KAGAN", "name": "CHERIE R.
