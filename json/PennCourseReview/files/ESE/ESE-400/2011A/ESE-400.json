They felt that this class was very rewarding, as they learned concepts that were \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201cpractical.\u201d Students also felt that concepts in class were consolidated in the assigned case studies. One student even claimed, \u201c[ESE 400] is a fantastic class that will benefit me throughout my life and career.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;Almost all students thought that Dr. Cassel was a \u201cgreat professor\u201d and felt he did an excellent job teaching the quantitative analysis behind everyday business decisions. Dr. Cassel was \u201cprompt\u201d with grading and returning homework, and he ran the class in a \u201cvery organized\u201d way. Many students felt that Dr. Cassel gave them their \u201cmoney\u2019s worth.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;Students considered this a difficult class that moved very fast and required a lot of work, especially for the weekly case studies. Since class only met once a week, there was a quiz given every lecture. The course was recommended for anyone who \u201cwants some practical knowledge.\u201d Some even said that this was the \u201cbest course for engineers who are interested in finance and accounting.\u201d Knowledge of calculus and probability is required for this class.", "num_students": 98, "path": "/courses/21661/sections/401/reviews/317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "first_name": "THOMAS A.", "last_name": "CASSEL", "id": "317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "name": "THOMAS A.
