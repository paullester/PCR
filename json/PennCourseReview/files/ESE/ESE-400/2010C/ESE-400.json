{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2555"}, "description": "This course investigates methods of economic analysis for decision making among alternative courses of action in engineering applications. Topics include: cost-driven design economics, break-even anlaysis, money-time relationships, rates of return, cost estimation, depreciation and taxes, foreign exchange rates, life cycle analysis, benefit-cost ratios, risk analysis, capital financing and allocation, and financial statement analysis. Case studies apply these topics to actual engineering problems. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ENGINEERING ECONOMICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23033/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.35", "rDifficulty": "2.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "3.74", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "2.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.32", "rInstructorQuality": "3.35"}, "section": {"name": "ENGINEERING ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-400-401", "path": "/courses/23033/sections/401", "id": "23033-401", "aliases": ["ESE-400-401", "ESE-540-401"]}, "comments": "This course investigates methods of economic analysis for decision making among alternative courses of action in engineering applications.

Case studies apply these topics to actual engineering problems.\r\n\r\nStudents generally enjoyed the course material, which they felt was not too tough. The course is catered towards engineering students, who mostly described it as an excellent introduction to economics for them. Many felt that the group case study assignments were informative and extremely involved, though they could be confusing for students at times.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Cassel as a \u201ccompelling and organized lecturer\u201d who presented the material in a way that was easy to understand. His excellent organization of the course was especially emphasized, and some students even felt that he made the class feel \u201cincredibly manageable\u201d despite the extremely heavy workload.\r\n\r\nNearly every student mentioned the extremely heavy and even \u201cridiculous\u201d workload in the class; there was a quiz, homework assignment, and case study due every week. However, students were divided about its necessity. Some felt that it helped them learn a lot, but others said it detracted from the otherwise interesting subject matter. On the other hand, most students agreed that the exams were straightforward and averages were high.\r\n", "num_students": 85, "path": "/courses/23033/sections/401/reviews/317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "first_name": "THOMAS A.", "last_name": "CASSEL", "id": "317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "name": "THOMAS A.
