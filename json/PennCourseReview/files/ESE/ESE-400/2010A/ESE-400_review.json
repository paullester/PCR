Topics include: cost-driven design economics, break-even analysis, money-time relationships, rates of return, cost estimation, depreciation and taxes, foreign exchange rates, life cycle analysis, benefit-cost ratios, risk analysis, capital financing and allocation, and financial statement analysis. Case studies apply these topics to actual engineering problems.\r\n\r\nStudents thoroughly enjoyed the content of the course, agreeing that it was very challenging and rewarding. For many it was their first business-related class, and provided a \u201cgood basic primer/foundation for the fields of finance and accounting\u201d and a \u201csolid understanding of how individual businesses deal with money\u201d. Many students enjoyed the case studies assignments, preferring to have more of them over the standard homework and readings which could get \u201ctedious\u201d at times. However, some felt that the case studies were too numerous and \u201chard to get used to\u201d.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that Professor Cassel did an \u201cimpressive job teaching engineering students the mathematics of business\u201d, even inspiring one student to pursue an Entrepreneurship minor. Professor Cassel was \u201ceasy to listen to and full of excellent and pertinent real-world experience\u201d, as well as being \u201ckind, understanding, and open for discussions\u201d.\r\n\r\nThere was a general consensus on the heavy but rewarding workload of the course. This is a business-related course aimed at engineering students and required for majors, but recommended for non-majors as well.
