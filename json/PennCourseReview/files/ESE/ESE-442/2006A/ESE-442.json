Student work will focus on completing the design undertaken in ESE 441 and successfully implementing the project. Success will be verified using experimental and/or simualtion methods appropriate to the project that test the degree to which project objectives are achieved. Each project team will prepare a poster to support a final project presentation and demonstration to peers, faculty and external judges. The course will conclude with the submission of a final project written team report. During the semester there will be periodic project reviews with individual teams. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7697/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-442", "path": "/courses/7697", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7697/sections", "values": [{"name": "SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-442-001", "path": "/courses/7697/sections/001", "id": "7697-001", "aliases": ["ESE-442-001"]}, {"name": "SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT II", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ESE-442-002", "path": "/courses/7697/sections/002", "id": "7697-002", "aliases": ["ESE-442-002"]}, {"name": "SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT II", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "ESE-442-003", "path": "/courses/7697/sections/003", "id": "7697-003", "aliases": ["ESE-442-003"]}]}, "id": 7697, "aliases": ["ESE-442"]}
