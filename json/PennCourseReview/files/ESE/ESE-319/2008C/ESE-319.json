{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2553"}, "description": "Analysis and design of basic active circuits involving semiconductor devices including diodes, bipolar and field effect transistors. Single stage, differential, multi-stage, and operational amplifiers will be discussed including their high frequency response. Oscillators, wave shaping circuits, filters, feedback, stability, and power amplifiers will also be covered. A weekly three-hour laboratory will illustrate concepts and circuits discussed in the class. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "FNDMTL SOLID STATE CRCT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18638/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "2.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.35", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.06", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.82"}, "section": {"name": "FNDMTL SOLID STATE CRCT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-319-001", "path": "/courses/18638/sections/001", "id": "18638-001", "aliases": ["ESE-319-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/18638/sections/001/reviews/348-KENNETH-R-LAKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/348-KENNETH-R-LAKER", "first_name": "KENNETH R", "last_name": "LAKER", "id": "348-KENNETH-R-LAKER", "name": "KENNETH R LAKER"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "18638-001-348-KENNETH-R-LAKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-319", "path": "/courses/18638", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18638/sections", "values": [{"name": "FNDMTL SOLID STATE CRCT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-319-001", "path": "/courses/18638/sections/001", "id": "18638-001", "aliases": ["ESE-319-001"]}]}, "id": 18638, "aliases": ["ESE-319"]}
