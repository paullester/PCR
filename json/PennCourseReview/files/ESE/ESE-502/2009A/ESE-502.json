{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2812"}, "description": "The course is designed to introduce students to modern statistical methods for analyzing spatial data. These methods include nearest-neighbor analyses of spatial point patterns, variogram and kriging analyses of continuous spatial data, and autoregression analyses of area data. The underlying statistical theory of each method is developed and illustrated in terms of selected GIS applications. Students are also given some experience with ARCMAP, JMPIN, and MATLAB software. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "INTR TO SPATIAL ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15714/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.83", "rStimulateInterest": "1.83", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTR TO SPATIAL ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-502-001", "path": "/courses/15714/sections/001", "id": "15714-001", "aliases": ["ESE-502-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/15714/sections/001/reviews/1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH", "first_name": "TONY EDWARD", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH", "name": "TONY EDWARD SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "15714-001-1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-502", "path": "/courses/15714", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15714/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTR TO SPATIAL ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-502-001", "path": "/courses/15714/sections/001", "id": "15714-001", "aliases": ["ESE-502-001"]}]}, "id": 15714, "aliases": ["ESE-502"]}
