These methods include nearest-neighbor analyses of spatial point patterns, variogram and kriging analyses of continuous spatial data, and autoregression analyses of area data. The underlying statistical theory of each method is developed and illustrated in terms of selected GIS applications. Students are also given some experience with ARCMAP, JMPIN, and MATLAB software.&#8232;&#8232;While some students found that the course introduced \u201ca variety of interesting subjects,\u201d most felt that the course went \u201ctoo fast.\u201d There was \u201ca lot of material\u201d, but \u201cnot enough covered to the extent where most of the class [understood] it.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;Students tended to agree that Professor Smith\u2019s notes were \u201csometimes helpful,\u201d but that he tended to \u201cgo off topic.\u201d He was described as \u201can expert in the subject.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;The majority of students felt that the course was \u201ctoo difficult.\u201d Many felt that the course \u201crequires too much work.\u201d This course was recommended for majors only. &#8232;&#8232;This review is based on the 6 student comments which were submitted.", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/21665/sections/001/reviews/1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH", "first_name": "TONY EDWARD", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH", "name": "TONY EDWARD SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "21665-001-1170-TONY-EDWARD-SMITH"}]
