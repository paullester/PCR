First, the fundamental mathematics of linear spaces and linear operator theory are introduced. Next, the course focuses on concepts of stability, controllability, and observability.\r\n\r\nGenerally, students found the content of the class to be enjoyable. Many found the material to be extremely useful and \u201cgreat\u201d to learn. Homework assignments were excellent but \u201cvery difficult\u201d and required a lot of time. Some complained that the course could have included more examples and a greater focus on concepts rather than formulas. The textbook was also described as \u201cpoor.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Kothmann received great praise from his students. He was described as \u201cextremely helpful\u201d and very willing to meet outside of class to discuss problems. Many students enjoyed his teaching style. One student explained that his \u201cdynamic teaching style\u201d is \u201chighly engaging.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gradate level course is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a strong background in linear algebra and differential equations. Overall, the course was described as \u201cvery difficult\u201d in general and \u201cextremely challenging\u201d for undergraduates.", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/18645/sections/001/reviews/3294-BRUCE-D--KOTHMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3294-BRUCE-D--KOTHMANN", "first_name": "BRUCE D.", "last_name": "KOTHMANN", "id": "3294-BRUCE-D--KOTHMANN", "name": "BRUCE D.
