{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2813"}, "description": "This course examines the characteristics and behavior of systems which adapt to changes in the environment. Observation of adaptive systems reveals the existence of some of the following properties and/or capabilities: learning, memory, sensing, acting, directing attention, having redundant sub-systems, communicating, predicting the future, creativity, being able to choose, recreating, willing to protect its descendants, dreaming, taking risks, reasoning, cooperating, forming conceptual domain by abstracting and modeling the world, recognizing the constraints, etc. This course will explore methodologies that are being used for designing man-made systems (infrastructures, corporations, government, etc.). The question that will be explored is why and how an adaptive (biological or otherwise) system responds to changes in the environment. We are interested in learning how that understanding can inform the design of man-made systems. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ADAPTIVE COMPLEX SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14459/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.29", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "2.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.14", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "ADAPTIVE COMPLEX SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-507-001", "path": "/courses/14459/sections/001", "id": "14459-001", "aliases": ["ESE-507-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/14459/sections/001/reviews/1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "first_name": "IRAJ", "last_name": "ZANDI", "id": "1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "name": "IRAJ ZANDI"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "14459-001-1175-IRAJ-ZANDI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-507", "path": "/courses/14459", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14459/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADAPTIVE COMPLEX SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-507-001", "path": "/courses/14459/sections/001", "id": "14459-001", "aliases": ["ESE-507-001"]}]}, "id": 14459, "aliases": ["ESE-507"]}
