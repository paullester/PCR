{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3086"}, "description": "This is the second of a two-semester sequence introduction to the ESE major placing primary emphasis on techniques for the analysis and synthesis of systems. We will introduce a wide range of mathematical concepts and techniques - optimization; probabilistic and statistical methods; identification, adaptation and learning; stabilization and control, logic and formal languages -and place them in the toolbox of scientific approaches to systems engineering. Once again, we will use the context of programming legged robotic behaviors as the concrete source of motivating problems, but will draw connections across a wide range of physical, social, and abstract system settings to provide a sense of the present power and limitations of systems science. Both semesters' courses are organized into three components - a lecture focused on intellectual content, a lecture focused on the craft of programming, and a laboratory experience that uses the empirical world to illustrate the context in which programming craft subserves disciplinary goals. Service learning (teaching targeted concepts to local high school classes in prepared settings) will form an integral component of both semesters' work. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "INTRO TO ESE-SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7681/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "3.21", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "2.79", "rReadingsValue": "1.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.07", "rCommAbility": "2.07", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ESE-SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-113-001", "path": "/courses/7681/sections/001", "id": "7681-001", "aliases": ["ESE-113-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/7681/sections/001/reviews/2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "first_name": "DANIEL E.", "last_name": "KODITSCHEK", "id": "2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "name": "DANIEL E.
