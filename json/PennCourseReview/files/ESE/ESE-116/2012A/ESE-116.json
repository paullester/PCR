{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2797"}, "description": "This course consists of an introduction to the C programming language focusing on its application to low-level computer resoruce control. C language instruction topics include: variable data types and scope, expressions, bitwise operations, control structures, preprocessor macros and include files, functions, arrays, and structs. The course contains an extended discussion of pointers and the relationship between variable values and their addresses in memory. Each student will gain individual practice in the use of the language by programming his/her own small microcontroller board to implement a series of \"real-world\" projects. These projects include a home automations system, an Internet controller for the automation system, and an accurate digital clock based on Internet time service. To encourage creativity, every student is given latitude to add his/her own extra-credit enhancements to these projects. Some previous knowledge of a high-level programming language will be helpful, but no prior knowledge of electronics is required. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "INTRO TO C PROGRAMMING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27354/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "1.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO C PROGRAMMING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-116-001", "path": "/courses/27354/sections/001", "id": "27354-001", "aliases": ["ESE-116-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/27354/sections/001/reviews/2468-PHILIP-V--LOPRESTI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2468-PHILIP-V--LOPRESTI", "first_name": "PHILIP V.", "last_name": "LOPRESTI", "id": "2468-PHILIP-V--LOPRESTI", "name": "PHILIP V.
