{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4238"}, "description": "This is a 1.0 cu research-patterned, open-ended, laboratory-focused course addressing the interface between robotics and integrative biology. The goal is to identify and then explore and possibly add to a specific corner of the scientific literature wherein it is possible to reach the horizons of knowledge quickly because the relevant empirical tools have only recently become available for broad use. We will focus attention on the development of complex adaptive behavior in a legged robotic system with emphasis on such modalities as locomotion, manipulation, situational awareness, localization and mapping and so on. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ROBO & BIOINSPIRED SYS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15704/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "ROBO & BIOINSPIRED SYS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-313-001", "path": "/courses/15704/sections/001", "id": "15704-001", "aliases": ["ESE-313-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/15704/sections/001/reviews/2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "first_name": "DANIEL E.", "last_name": "KODITSCHEK", "id": "2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "name": "DANIEL E.
