Some students felt that they could have easily learned all of the content from reading a textbook instead of taking the course. Students did enjoy the appearance of guest lecturers.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that Professor Pourdehnad held unstructured lectures and \u201cunclear and ambiguous assignments.\u201d Impressions of the workload for the course were mixed. Some felt that the there was far too much work, while others felt it was an easy course with little gained. They were also disappointed with the feedback given for graded material. Students noted that the course was not \u201cvery relevant\u201d for more tech oriented students. Some students felt that the course was suitable for Systems engineers. \r\n", "num_students": 70, "path": "/courses/17320/sections/401/reviews/2369-JAHANGIR-POURDEHNAD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2369-JAHANGIR-POURDEHNAD", "first_name": "JAHANGIR", "last_name": "POURDEHNAD", "id": "2369-JAHANGIR-POURDEHNAD", "name": "JAHANGIR POURDEHNAD"}, "num_reviewers": 61, "id": "17320-401-2369-JAHANGIR-POURDEHNAD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-444", "path": "/courses/17320", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17320/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROJECT MANAGEMENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-444-401", "path": "/courses/17320/sections/401", "id": "17320-401", "aliases": ["ESE-444-401", "ESE-544-401"]}]}, "id": 17320, "aliases": ["ESE-444", "ESE-544"]}
