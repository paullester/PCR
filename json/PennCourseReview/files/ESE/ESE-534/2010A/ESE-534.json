{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5324"}, "description": "Organization and design of physical computational systems, basic building block for computations, understanding and exploiting structure in computational problems, design space, costs, and tradeoffs in computer organization, common machine abstractions, and implementation/optimization techniques. The course will develop fundamental issues and tradeoffs which define computer organizational and architectural styles including RISC, VLIW, Super Scalar, EPIC, SIMD, Vector, MIMD, reconfigurable FPGA, PIM, and SoC. Basic topics in the design of computational units, instruction organization, memory systems, control and data flow, and interconnect will also be covered. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "COMPUTER ORGANIZATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26003/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.07", "rDifficulty": "3.87", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.27", "rCommAbility": "2.87", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "COMPUTER ORGANIZATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-534-001", "path": "/courses/26003/sections/001", "id": "26003-001", "aliases": ["ESE-534-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/26003/sections/001/reviews/4321-ANDRE-DEHON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4321-ANDRE-DEHON", "first_name": "ANDRE", "last_name": "DEHON", "id": "4321-ANDRE-DEHON", "name": "ANDRE DEHON"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "26003-001-4321-ANDRE-DEHON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-534", "path": "/courses/26003", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26003/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMPUTER ORGANIZATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-534-001", "path": "/courses/26003/sections/001", "id": "26003-001", "aliases": ["ESE-534-001"]}]}, "id": 26003, "aliases": ["ESE-534"]}
