Students appreciated Dr. Keenan\u2019s use of PowerPoint slides for definitions and the chalkboard for examples. However, students also felt that examples should play a more central role in the class.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that Dr. Keenan \u201ctaught the concepts well\u201d and was \u201cvery interesting.\u201d Dr. Keenan was described as an \u201cengaging instructor\u201d who was \u201cclear and helpful.\u201d Many students stressed that he \u201cwas always helpful and had a great ability to \u201cconvey the material.\u201d When students had a question outside of class, Dr. Kennan was always \u201ceasy to reach\u201d via e-mail. \r\n\r\nThis class is highly recommended for major students, for whom the class is required.\r\n", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/23025/sections/001/reviews/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "KEENAN", "id": "1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "name": "JOHN D KEENAN"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "23025-001-1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-301", "path": "/courses/23025", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23025/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENGINEERING PROBABILITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ESE-301-001", "path": "/courses/23025/sections/001", "id": "23025-001", "aliases": ["ESE-301-001"]}]}, "id": 23025, "aliases": ["ESE-301"]}
