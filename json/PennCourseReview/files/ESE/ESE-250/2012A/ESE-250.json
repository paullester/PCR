Students stated that they wished they learned more applicable engineering knowledge in class. However, students noted that lab techniques learned were useful.\r\nStudents wished that TA\u2019s were more prepared to help during the TA-run lab portions. Students wished that assignments were graded in a timelier manner, especially lab reports. No students commented on the teaching ability of the professor.\r\n\r\nThis class is intended for sophomores in Electrical Engineering. Students reported that while workload wasn\u2019t too intense, the grading, especially for labs were harsh.\r\n\r\nThis review was based on comments that 8 students submitted. \r\n", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/27361/sections/001/reviews/2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "first_name": "DANIEL E.", "last_name": "KODITSCHEK", "id": "2951-DANIEL-E--KODITSCHEK", "name": "DANIEL E.
