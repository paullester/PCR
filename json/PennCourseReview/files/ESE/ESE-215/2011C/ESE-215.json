Students reported him as\r\nbeing \u201cgreat,\u201d an \u201cexcellent professor,\u201d and an \u201cawesome lecturer. Students stated that\r\nthe course felt rushed towards the end and one suggested that Lee could \u201ccover the first\r\nfew chapters much faster and cover the harder material such as phasors in more detail and\r\nfor more time.\u201d Students reported Professor Lee and the TAs as both being extremely\r\nhelpful and easy to meet with. Students praised Professor Lee for being clear and concise\r\nin his lectures, and coming well prepared to class.\r\nThe class generally consisted of undergraduates between freshman and junior year\r\nand requires PHYS 151 experience.
