The purpose of this course is to introduce basic concepts in the design of three-dimensional products. For purposes of the course, design is understood as a creative act of synthesis expressed through various modes of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional representation. The course will emphasize the development of basic design skill sets ranging from hand sketching to the use of digital modeling software and rapid prototyping. Fulfills the requirement for a design background course in the interdisciplinary program in Integrated Product Design (IPD). \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "PRODUCT DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28293/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARCH-300", "path": "/courses/28293", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28293/sections", "values": []}, "id": 28293, "aliases": ["ARCH-300"]}
