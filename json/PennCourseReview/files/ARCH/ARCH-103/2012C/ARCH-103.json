{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5510"}, "description": "This seminar will study the idea of villeggiature (villa life) and the ideology associated with countryside gardens and plantations. In the literature on villa gardens across the centuries, from ancient Rome to the 20th century, there emerges a recurrent opposition between the country seen as an occasion for self-improvement versus it being an opportunity for self- indulgence, the representation of social status, and at times the display of opulence and political power. In an examination of the circularity of villa ideology across the centuries, other themes will emerge that address the relationship between urban and rural life, between architecture and natural environment and between social, cultural, economic, and political forces and landscape design. These themes will be explore through the study of selected villas and through the reading of sources drawn from villa literature, including architectural and agricultural treatises, epistolary exchanges, and drawings. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "VILLA GARDENS AND VILLA LIFE: CULTURAL AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28550/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rTAQuality": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23"}, "section": {"name": "VILLA GARDENS AND VILLA LIFE: CULTURAL AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ARCH-103-301", "path": "/courses/28550/sections/301", "id": "28550-301", "aliases": ["ARCH-103-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/28550/sections/301/reviews/6118-RAFFAELLA-FABIANI-GIANNETTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6118-RAFFAELLA-FABIANI-GIANNETTO", "first_name": "RAFFAELLA", "last_name": "FABIANI GIANNETTO", "id": "6118-RAFFAELLA-FABIANI-GIANNETTO", "name": "RAFFAELLA FABIANI GIANNETTO"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "28550-301-6118-RAFFAELLA-FABIANI-GIANNETTO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARCH-103", "path": "/courses/28550", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28550/sections", "values": [{"name": "VILLA GARDENS AND VILLA LIFE: CULTURAL AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ARCH-103-301", "path": "/courses/28550/sections/301", "id": "28550-301", "aliases": ["ARCH-103-301"]}]}, "id": 28550, "aliases": ["ARCH-103"]}
