Emphasis is given to materials, their manipulation, and the consequences of their inter-relationships. This course teaches analysis of precedents and the production of new works to visualize relationships that compliment draw with a material imagination and vocabulary. \r\n\r\nStudents found this course \u201cinteresting,\u201d and one reported that they had \"learned a lot in this course and earned a satisfaction I have not experienced in any other class.\u201d Students commented that they were pleased and noted that this course was the source of \u201cthe work [they are] most proud of this semester and something that [they felt] will be a strong addition to [their] portofolio[s].\u201d \r\n\r\nSome students found the professor to be \u201cdisorganized\u201d and restrictive in recommendations for the final project. Explanations, especially tutorials in computer programs, were not helpful enough, and students often felt rushed. One student noted that although the material was introduced well and the conceptual aspects of the projects were explained, the professor was \u201cnot very helpful throughout the semester.\u201d \r\n\r\nMany of the students commented that this course was intended to be a first step towards a major. Also, frequently students noted confusion about what the professors expected and therefore were not sure about grades. The workload was \u201ctoo heavy\u201d and the class was \u201cvery disorganized.\u201d Some students even admitted they felt the need to skip other courses in order to finish assignments in time. A major critique of this class centered on the final project. Many students felt unprepared and noted that the professor expected results while students felt they were \u201cwithout the training to do so\u201d and \u201cstrongly believe[d] that [they] should have been given more technical training.\u201d The most common complaint involved the cost of the final project, which one student noted was around $500 and had to be paid by the students.", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/25616/sections/001/reviews/120-RICHARD-WESLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/120-RICHARD-WESLEY", "first_name": "RICHARD", "last_name": "WESLEY", "id": "120-RICHARD-WESLEY", "name": "RICHARD WESLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 31, "id": "25616-001-120-RICHARD-WESLEY"}]
