{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4515"}, "description": "This course in theory and history will reconsider the architecture of the twentieth century and ask questions about the building's most visible and articulate surface: the facade. Added to the typical concerns with production and representation will be a topic of design and experience that is often overlooked: performance. The course will argue a simple thesis: the way the building looks is largely determined by what the building does. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "THEORY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28554/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.44", "rDifficulty": "2.28", "rTAQuality": "2.22", "rStimulateInterest": "0.94", "rRecommendMajor": "2.06", "rCourseQuality": "1.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.41", "rCommAbility": "1.50", "rInstructorQuality": "1.61"}, "section": {"name": "THEORY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARCH-411-401", "path": "/courses/28554/sections/401", "id": "28554-401", "aliases": ["ARCH-411-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/28554/sections/401/reviews/6229-DANIEL-BARBER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6229-DANIEL-BARBER", "first_name": "DANIEL", "last_name": "BARBER", "id": "6229-DANIEL-BARBER", "name": "DANIEL BARBER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "28554-401-6229-DANIEL-BARBER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARCH-411", "path": "/courses/28554", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28554/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARCH-411-401", "path": "/courses/28554/sections/401", "id": "28554-401", "aliases": ["ARCH-411-401"]}]}, "id": 28554, "aliases": ["ARCH-411"]}
