{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4515"}, "description": "This course in theory and history will reconsider the architecture of the twentieth century and ask questions about the building's most visible and articulate surface: the facade. Added to the typical concerns with production and representation will be a topic of design and experience that is often overlooked: performance. The course will argue a simple thesis: the way the building looks is largely determined by what the building does. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "HISTORY/THEORY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23998/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "2.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.14", "rCommAbility": "2.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "HISTORY/THEORY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARCH-411-401", "path": "/courses/23998/sections/401", "id": "23998-401", "aliases": ["ARCH-411-401", "ARCH-711-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/23998/sections/401/reviews/1788-DAVID-E-LEATHERBARROW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1788-DAVID-E-LEATHERBARROW", "first_name": "DAVID E", "last_name": "LEATHERBARROW", "id": "1788-DAVID-E-LEATHERBARROW", "name": "DAVID E LEATHERBARROW"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "23998-401-1788-DAVID-E-LEATHERBARROW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARCH-411", "path": "/courses/23998", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23998/sections", "values": [{"name": "HISTORY/THEORY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARCH-411-401", "path": "/courses/23998/sections/401", "id": "23998-401", "aliases": ["ARCH-411-401", "ARCH-711-401"]}]}, "id": 23998, "aliases": ["ARCH-411", "ARCH-711"]}
