{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/150"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to computer graphic technology in the context of current architectural practice. We use AutoCAD's latest release (now 2007) as the basic software for the course. AutoCAD is the most widely-used architectural software and provides a good grounding for exploration of other programs. Topics include basic vector graphics, two-dimensional drawing and drafting and basic three-dimensional modeling. The course is organized around a series of structured exercises that illustrate basic principles and enable students to develop greater facility with the software. The modeling emphasis is placed on quick study models as part of the design process. There is also a field trip to the offices of Venturi, Scott Brand and Associates to see the use of computers in their practice. No experience with Auto CAD software is required. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS IN ARCHITECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14092/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "1.65", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.65", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.35"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS IN ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARCH-440-001", "path": "/courses/14092/sections/001", "id": "14092-001", "aliases": ["ARCH-440-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/14092/sections/001/reviews/121-TIMOTHY-KEARNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/121-TIMOTHY-KEARNEY", "first_name": "TIMOTHY", "last_name": "KEARNEY", "id": "121-TIMOTHY-KEARNEY", "name": "TIMOTHY KEARNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "14092-001-121-TIMOTHY-KEARNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARCH-440", "path": "/courses/14092", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14092/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS IN ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARCH-440-001", "path": "/courses/14092/sections/001", "id": "14092-001", "aliases": ["ARCH-440-001"]}]}, "id": 14092, "aliases": ["ARCH-440"]}
