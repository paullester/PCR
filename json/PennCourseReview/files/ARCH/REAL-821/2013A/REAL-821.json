{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4401"}, "description": "This course evaluates \"ground-up\" development as well as re-hab, re-development, and acquisition investments. We examine raw and developed land and the similarities and differences of traditional real estate product types including office, R & D, retail, warehouses, single family and multi-family residential, mixed use, and land as well as \"specialty\" uses like golf courses, assisted living, and fractional share ownership. Emphasis is on concise analysis and decision making. We discuss the development process with topics including market analysis, site acquisition, due diligence, zoning, entitlements, approvals, site planning, building design, construction, financing, leasing, and ongoing management and disposition. Special topics like workouts and running a development company are also discussed. Throughout the course, we focus on risk management and leadership issues. Numerous guest lecturers who are leaders in the real estate industry participate in the learning process. Format: predominately case analysis and discussion, some lectures, project visits. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30946/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.73", "rTAQuality": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.76", "rWorkRequired": "3.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "3.34", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.87"}, "section": {"name": "REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "REAL-821-401", "path": "/courses/30946/sections/401", "id": "30946-401", "aliases": ["REAL-821-401", "ARCH-768-401", "REAL-321-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/30946/sections/401/reviews/5525-ASUKA-NAKAHARA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5525-ASUKA-NAKAHARA", "first_name": "ASUKA", "last_name": "NAKAHARA", "id": "5525-ASUKA-NAKAHARA", "name": "ASUKA NAKAHARA"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "30946-401-5525-ASUKA-NAKAHARA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "REAL-821", "path": "/courses/30946", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30946/sections", "values": [{"name": "REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "REAL-821-401", "path": "/courses/30946/sections/401", "id": "30946-401", "aliases": ["REAL-821-401", "ARCH-768-401", "REAL-321-401"]}]}, "id": 30946, "aliases": ["REAL-821", "ARCH-768", "REAL-321"]}
