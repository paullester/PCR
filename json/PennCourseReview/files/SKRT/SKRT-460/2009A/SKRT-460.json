{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4415"}, "description": "Students will learn the entire Sanskrit grammar by the end of the first year. They will be able to read Sanskrit texts and compose Sanskrit sentences in addition to carrying out simple conversation. During the year we will also read simple inscriptions and sections from texts like the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita, Pancatantra, and Yoga Sutra. Throughout the semester, we will also discuss selected readings and visual materials that introduce students to the broad contours of Sanskrit culture. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "SANSKRIT: 1ST YEAR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16446/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "SANSKRIT: 1ST YEAR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SKRT-460-001", "path": "/courses/16446/sections/001", "id": "16446-001", "aliases": ["SKRT-460-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/16446/sections/001/reviews/4103-DEVEN-M--PATEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4103-DEVEN-M--PATEL", "first_name": "DEVEN M.", "last_name": "PATEL", "id": "4103-DEVEN-M--PATEL", "name": "DEVEN M.
