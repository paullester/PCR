Films considered will include: the German expressionists masterworks of the silent era, the Universal classics of the 30's and the low-budget horror films produced by Val Lewton in the 40's for RKO in the US, the 1950's color films of sex and violence by Hammer studios in England, Italian Gothic horror or giallo (Mario Brava) and French lyrical macabre (Georges Franju) in the 60's, and on to contemporary gore. In an effort to better understand how the horror film makes us confront out worst fears and our most secret desires alike, we will look at the genre's main iconic figures (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc.) as well as issues of ethics, gender, sexuality, violence, spectatorship through a variety of critical lenses (psychoanalysis, socio-historial and cultural context, aesthetics,...). \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HORROR CINEMA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26105/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.44", "rDifficulty": "1.79", "rStimulateInterest": "3.32", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.05", "rWorkRequired": "1.97", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.21", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "HORROR CINEMA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FREN-382-401", "path": "/courses/26105/sections/401", "id": "26105-401", "aliases": ["FREN-382-401", "CINE-382-401", "COML-372-401"]}, "comments": "The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the history and main themes of the supernatural/horror film from a comparative perspective.
