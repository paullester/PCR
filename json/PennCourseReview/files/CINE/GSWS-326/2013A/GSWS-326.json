{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5669"}, "description": "This course surveys major themes in the emerging and interdisciplinary field of Transgender Studies. We begin by mapping its development through, and divergence from, feminist and queer theory. Making connections to literature, biopolitics, cultural anthropology and disability studies, students will explore the potential of trans theory for interdisciplinary humanities work. We will animate the prefix trans to think with and across keywords, modifying and enhancing our understanding of the trans-national, trans-racial, trans-historical, and even trans-animal. At the same time we will engage social justice movements for gender liberation and connect everyday formations of gender to institutional constraints on subjectivity. To do trans theory is always to recognize the intersecting formations of race, nation, class and ability that inform both the concept and lived experience of trans identity. The readings reflect a range of disciplinary voices, including diverse forms of scholarship like memoir and manifesto. The syllabus privileges trans theorists, artists and activists so that students can appreciate the expanding canon of Transgender Studies. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THEORIES:GENDR,SEXUALITY: INVENTING TRANSGENDER: THEORY, PERFORMANCE, POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30410/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "THEORIES:GENDR,SEXUALITY: INVENTING TRANSGENDER: THEORY, PERFORMANCE, POLITICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GSWS-326-401", "path": "/courses/30410/sections/401", "id": "30410-401", "aliases": ["GSWS-326-401", "GSWS-526-401", "CINE-326-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/30410/sections/401/reviews/6287-JEANNE-VACCARO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6287-JEANNE-VACCARO", "first_name": "JEANNE", "last_name": "VACCARO", "id": "6287-JEANNE-VACCARO", "name": "JEANNE VACCARO"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "30410-401-6287-JEANNE-VACCARO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSWS-326", "path": "/courses/30410", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30410/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORIES:GENDR,SEXUALITY: INVENTING TRANSGENDER: THEORY, PERFORMANCE, POLITICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GSWS-326-401", "path": "/courses/30410/sections/401", "id": "30410-401", "aliases": ["GSWS-326-401", "GSWS-526-401", "CINE-326-401"]}]}, "id": 30410, "aliases": ["GSWS-326", "GSWS-526", "CINE-326"]}
