{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3666"}, "description": "The course will consist of a broad and varied sampling of classic Italian films from WWII to the present. The curriculum will be divided into four units: (1) The Neorealist Revolution, (2) Metacinema, (3) Fascism and War Revisited, and (4) Postmodernism or the Death of the Cinema. One of the aims of the course will be to develop a sense of \"cinematic literacy\"--to develop critical techniques that will make us active interpretators of the cinematic image by challenging the expectations that Hollywood has implanted in us: that films be action-packed wish-fulfillment fantasies. Italian cinema will invite us to re-examine and revise the very narrow conception that we Americans have of the medium. We will also use the films as a means to explore the postwar Italian culture so powerfully reflected, and in turn, shaped, by its national cinema. Classes will include close visual analysis of films using video clips and slides. The films will be in Italian with English subtitles and will include works of Fellini, Antonioni, De Sica, Visconti, Pasolini, Wertuller, Rossellini, Rossellini, Bertolucci and Moretti. \n\nStudents will be asked actively to participate in class discussion, and to write a series of critical papers keyed to the units around which the course will be organized. Substantial Writing Component. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "FILMS OF FELLINI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10603/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-322", "path": "/courses/10603", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10603/sections", "values": [{"name": "FILMS OF FELLINI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-322-401", "path": "/courses/10603/sections/401", "id": "10603-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-322-401", "FILM-240-401"]}]}, "id": 10603, "aliases": ["ITAL-322", "FILM-240"]}
