Students were also introduced to the key critical concepts (such as the notion of the \"auteur\" film genre) informing the discussion of films in France. The films were studied in both an historical and theoretical context, related to their period styles (e.g. \"le realisme poetique,\" \"la Nouvelle Vague,\" etc.), their \"auteurs,\" the nature of the French star system, the role of the other arts, as well to the critical debates they have sparked among critics and historians. Students acquired the analytical tools in French to discuss films as artistic and as cultural texts. &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nMany students enjoyed the class, finding it \u201cthought-provoking and interesting.\u201d \r\nHowever, some student felt that the selection of films for the class was \u201cpoorly chosen,\u201d and students in the French recitation section were upset that their recitations were only half conducted in French. They felt that such an environment was not helpful to the study of the French language.\r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed Professor Met, describing him as \u201cfun,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cpassionate,\u201d and a \u201cgreat lecturer.\u201d Students appreciated Professor Met\u2019s explanation of the material, and they liked that he taught \u201cabout French cinema in a way it could be grasped.\u201d They also liked that he explained \u201ccultural notes to those of us who weren\u2019t taking the class in French too.\u201d Some students felt that Professot Met\u2019s lecturing style was a bit stilted, explaining that \u201che tends to become very repetitive and held back by one question or one thought.\u201d Overall, students commended Professor Met on his knowledge and command of the material.&#8232;\r\n\r\nThe class could be taken as a French credit or as a Cinema Studies credit, and to receive French credit, students needed to enroll in the French recitation. Cinema Studies students felt that they could understand the class material without knowledge of French culture. Some of the French students felt that the class was \u201cmore geared towards the cinema studies kids rather than the French kids.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/23125/sections/401/reviews/1459-PHILIPPE-C--MET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1459-PHILIPPE-C--MET", "first_name": "PHILIPPE C.", "last_name": "MET", "id": "1459-PHILIPPE-C--MET", "name": "PHILIPPE C.
