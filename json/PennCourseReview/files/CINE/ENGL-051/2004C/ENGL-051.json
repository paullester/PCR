This course will begin with the Napoleonic Wars and this Regency aftermath to survey a century of British literature -- from Romanticism through the revolutions of 1848 and the Victorian and Edwardian periods to the beginning of the first World War.

Others may incorporate drama and non-fiction prose. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5213/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.73", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "1.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "1.87", "rInstructorQuality": "2.07"}, "section": {"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-401", "path": "/courses/5213/sections/401", "id": "5213-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-401", "WSTD-051-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/5213/sections/401/reviews/420-NINA-J-AUERBACH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/420-NINA-J-AUERBACH", "first_name": "NINA J", "last_name": "AUERBACH", "id": "420-NINA-J-AUERBACH", "name": "NINA J AUERBACH"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "5213-401-420-NINA-J-AUERBACH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-051", "path": "/courses/5213", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5213/sections", "values": [{"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-401", "path": "/courses/5213/sections/401", "id": "5213-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-401", "WSTD-051-401"]}]}, "id": 5213, "aliases": ["ENGL-051", "WSTD-051"]}
