This course will begin with the Napoleonic Wars and this Regency aftermath to survey a century of British literature -- from Romanticism through the revolutions of 1848 and the Victorian and Edwardian periods to the beginning of the first World War.

Others may incorporate drama and non-fiction prose. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14361/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-001", "path": "/courses/14361/sections/001", "id": "14361-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/14361/sections/001/reviews/393-RACHEL-S-BUURMA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/393-RACHEL-S-BUURMA", "first_name": "RACHEL S", "last_name": "BUURMA", "id": "393-RACHEL-S-BUURMA", "name": "RACHEL S BUURMA"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "14361-001-393-RACHEL-S-BUURMA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-051", "path": "/courses/14361", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14361/sections", "values": [{"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-001", "path": "/courses/14361/sections/001", "id": "14361-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-001"]}]}, "id": 14361, "aliases": ["ENGL-051"]}
