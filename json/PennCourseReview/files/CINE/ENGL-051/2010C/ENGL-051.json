This course will begin with the Napoleonic Wars and this Regency aftermath to survey a century of British literature -- from Romanticism through the revolutions of 1848 and the Victorian and Edwardian periods to the beginning of the first World War.

Others may incorporate drama and non-fiction prose. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22955/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "2.94", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.59", "rInstructorAccess": "3.65", "rReadingsValue": "3.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-601", "path": "/courses/22955/sections/601", "id": "22955-601", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/22955/sections/601/reviews/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "first_name": "DEBORAH S", "last_name": "BURNHAM", "id": "437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "name": "DEBORAH S BURNHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "22955-601-437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-051", "path": "/courses/22955", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22955/sections", "values": [{"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-601", "path": "/courses/22955/sections/601", "id": "22955-601", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-601"]}]}, "id": 22955, "aliases": ["ENGL-051"]}
