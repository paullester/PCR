This course will begin with the Napoleonic Wars and this Regency aftermath to survey a century of British literature -- from Romanticism through the revolutions of 1848 and the Victorian and Edwardian periods to the beginning of the first World War.

Others may incorporate drama and non-fiction prose. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21576/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.81", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-001", "path": "/courses/21576/sections/001", "id": "21576-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/21576/sections/001/reviews/2930-RACHAEL-L-NICHOLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2930-RACHAEL-L-NICHOLS", "first_name": "RACHAEL L", "last_name": "NICHOLS", "id": "2930-RACHAEL-L-NICHOLS", "name": "RACHAEL L NICHOLS"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "21576-001-2930-RACHAEL-L-NICHOLS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-051", "path": "/courses/21576", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21576/sections", "values": [{"name": "19TH-CENT BRITISH LIT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-051-001", "path": "/courses/21576/sections/001", "id": "21576-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-051-001"]}]}, "id": 21576, "aliases": ["ENGL-051"]}
