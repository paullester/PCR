{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/508"}, "description": "The purpose of this course will be to explore the following issues: What is the specificity of women in French society--what distinguishes the \"education\" --both familial and institutional--which contributes to the formation of a distinctly feminine sense and self? How has this specificity contributed to the roles and functions played by women over the course of the century? And finally, how have women--individually and collectively--become aware of these forces, and sought to modify them in order to devise introduction to French culture and society. Authors include: de Beauvoir, Carles, Djebar, Duras, Ernaux, Kofman, Weil. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "FRENCH IDENTITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/508/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.93", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "1.93", "rRecommendMajor": "2.43", "rCourseQuality": "1.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "2.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.43", "rCommAbility": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "FRENCH IDENTITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-301-301", "path": "/courses/508/sections/301", "id": "508-301", "aliases": ["FREN-301-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/508/sections/301/reviews/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "first_name": "MICHELE H.", "last_name": "RICHMAN", "id": "551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "name": "MICHELE H.
