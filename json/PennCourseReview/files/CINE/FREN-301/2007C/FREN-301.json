{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/508"}, "description": "The purpose of this course will be to explore the following issues: What is the specificity of women in French society--what distinguishes the \"education\" --both familial and institutional--which contributes to the formation of a distinctly feminine sense and self? How has this specificity contributed to the roles and functions played by women over the course of the century? And finally, how have women--individually and collectively--become aware of these forces, and sought to modify them in order to devise introduction to French culture and society. Authors include: de Beauvoir, Carles, Djebar, Duras, Ernaux, Kofman, Weil. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "FRENCH IDENTITY: FR IDENTITY THRU FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13303/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "FRENCH IDENTITY: FR IDENTITY THRU FILM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FREN-301-401", "path": "/courses/13303/sections/401", "id": "13303-401", "aliases": ["FREN-301-401", "CINE-345-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/13303/sections/401/reviews/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "first_name": "MICHELE H.", "last_name": "RICHMAN", "id": "551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "name": "MICHELE H.
