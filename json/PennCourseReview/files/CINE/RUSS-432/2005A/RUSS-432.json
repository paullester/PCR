{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2918"}, "description": "In Fate and Chance in Literature and Culture, we will explore these two interrelated concepts in comparative perspective over a broad historical range. As a result, the students will learn how the philosophy of fate and chance has been reflected in works of different Russian authors and in different cultural and political environments. In Russian as well as western systems of belief fate and chance represent two extreme visions of the universal order, or, perhaps, two diametrically opposed cosmic forces: complete determinism, on the one hand, and complete chaos or unpredictability, on the other. These visions have been greatly reflected by various mythopoetic systems. In this course, we will investigate religious and folkloric sources from a series of Russian traditions compared to other Indo-European traditions (Greek, East-European). Readings will include The Song of Prince Igor's Campaign, The Gambler by Dostoevsky, The Queen of Spades by Pushkin, Vij by Gogol, The Black Monk by Chekhov, The Fatal Eggs by Bulgakov, and more. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "FATE/CHANCE IN LIT&FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10976/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.53", "rDifficulty": "2.26", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.37", "rCourseQuality": "3.37", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "3.32", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.42", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.74"}, "section": {"name": "FATE/CHANCE IN LIT&FILM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "RUSS-432-601", "path": "/courses/10976/sections/601", "id": "10976-601", "aliases": ["RUSS-432-601", "FILM-432-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/10976/sections/601/reviews/1065-VERA-ZUBAREV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1065-VERA-ZUBAREV", "first_name": "VERA", "last_name": "ZUBAREV", "id": "1065-VERA-ZUBAREV", "name": "VERA ZUBAREV"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "10976-601-1065-VERA-ZUBAREV"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-432", "path": "/courses/10976", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10976/sections", "values": [{"name": "FATE/CHANCE IN LIT&FILM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "RUSS-432-601", "path": "/courses/10976/sections/601", "id": "10976-601", "aliases": ["RUSS-432-601", "FILM-432-601"]}]}, "id": 10976, "aliases": ["RUSS-432", "FILM-432"]}
