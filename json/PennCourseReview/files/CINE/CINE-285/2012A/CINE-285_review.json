A combination of lectures by instructors and practitioners, case studies, film screenings, and consulting projects with independent and Hollywood creators, packagers, financiers, exhibitors, distributors and publicists will illustrate the relationship between the art of film and the business of film. Guests will include screenwriters, agents, producers, directors, distributors, film festival curators and film critics. In short, the course tries to cover all aspects of making a film, and explores that often-tricky intersection of art and commerce.\r\n\r\n\tOverall, students really enjoyed this course, many of them describing it as the best class they had taken at Penn.  The class was described as \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201ca lot of fun,\u201d and a great course for \u201canyone with an interest in the entertainment business.\u201d  Several students noted that \u201cthe class could benefit from a lot more organization and structure,\u201d but one student believed the disorganization was due to the fact that this was only \u201cthe second time the course [had] been taught in its current format.\u201d  While most students found the level of the class to be appropriate, one student felt that the \u201cexpectations for the movie filming were too high.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tBoth professors were described as \u201ckind, intelligent, knowledgeable, funny, and down to earth,\u201d and were said to \u201cknow their subject matter very well.\u201d  Because of their experience in the film industry, the professors were thought to \u201cbring a grounded and practical approach to teaching a class about how the film industry actually works.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tNot much was said about the assignments, except that they \u201cwere great because they simulated real world situations in the film industry, such as working with groups and having to collaborate with others.\u201d  Additionally, one student wished there had been \u201cmore guest speakers in addition to the professors.\u201d  This review was based on eight student comments.", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/27140/sections/401/reviews/3296-EMORY-B-VAN-CLEVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3296-EMORY-B-VAN-CLEVE", "first_name": "EMORY B", "last_name": "VAN CLEVE", "id": "3296-EMORY-B-VAN-CLEVE", "name": "EMORY B VAN CLEVE"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "27140-401-3296-EMORY-B-VAN-CLEVE"}]
