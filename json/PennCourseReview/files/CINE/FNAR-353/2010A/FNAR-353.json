{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4248"}, "description": "Through a series of studio projects, this course will focus on advanced concepts in 3D computer animation and 2D compositing. The course will cover advanced techniques for rigging animated aharaters or structures, shading 3D forms, working with dynamic simulations, rendering projects, and compositing comples shots. Topis discussed will include production pipelines, motion-capture, and methods of developing ideas for animation. The schedule of the course will lend itself to allowing members to complete ambitious self-conceived animation projects. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ADV.
