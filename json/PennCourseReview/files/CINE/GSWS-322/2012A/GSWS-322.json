{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5426"}, "description": "This advanced seminar explores the social and material conditions that gave rise to the category transgender at the turn of the twenty-first century. We will engage this contested terrain by critically examining the category transgender through a series of questions. How did transgender emerge historically and what cultural work does it perform? What does it enable as a category and and what does it obscure? What are the possibilities and/or problems of using \"transgender\" to describe gender and sexuality cross-culturally? We will additionally consider 'transgender\" as a nexus of powerful social critique by exploring several thematic rubrics: medical and social histories, categories, embodiment, feminist politics, cross-cultural studies, and activism. To highlight the interdisciplinary formation of the field, we will study a variety of texts including yethnographic writing, memoir, documentary film, performance, activism and policy analysis, legal theory, medical and science studies, as well as feminist and queer theory \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "TRANSGENDER QUERIES: Advanced Topics: Gender & Sexuality Studies", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27523/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "1.33", "rInstructorQuality": "1.75"}, "section": {"name": "TRANSGENDER QUERIES: Advanced Topics: Gender & Sexuality Studies", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GSWS-322-301", "path": "/courses/27523/sections/301", "id": "27523-301", "aliases": ["GSWS-322-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/27523/sections/301/reviews/6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER", "first_name": "BENJAMIN", "last_name": "SINGER", "id": "6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER", "name": "BENJAMIN SINGER"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "27523-301-6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSWS-322", "path": "/courses/27523", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27523/sections", "values": [{"name": "TRANSGENDER QUERIES: Advanced Topics: Gender & Sexuality Studies", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GSWS-322-301", "path": "/courses/27523/sections/301", "id": "27523-301", "aliases": ["GSWS-322-301"]}]}, "id": 27523, "aliases": ["GSWS-322"]}
