{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5426"}, "description": "Violence against Women in Conflict: Sexuality, Terrorism, and Human Rights This course explores how women's experiences of violence in conflict are guided by traditional patriarchal views of femininity, and further how this violence impacts their human rights. Through academic texts, documents produced by the U.N. and NGOs globally, and documentaries, we will consider women's experiences of violence in contexts such as: how rape is used to decipher the borders and boundaries of emerging nations, as in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda; the highly complex experiences of women suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian and Sri Lankan conflicts; the relationship between domestic violence in the private/home space and the violence of war in the public space; and sexual violence against women in the U.S. military. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "QUEER AND FEMINIST FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30409/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "QUEER AND FEMINIST FILM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GSWS-322-401", "path": "/courses/30409/sections/401", "id": "30409-401", "aliases": ["GSWS-322-401", "CINE-322-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/30409/sections/401/reviews/6504-CATHERINE-NICOLE-HANNABACH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6504-CATHERINE-NICOLE-HANNABACH", "first_name": "CATHERINE NICOLE", "last_name": "HANNABACH", "id": "6504-CATHERINE-NICOLE-HANNABACH", "name": "CATHERINE NICOLE HANNABACH"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "30409-401-6504-CATHERINE-NICOLE-HANNABACH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSWS-322", "path": "/courses/30409", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30409/sections", "values": [{"name": "QUEER AND FEMINIST FILM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GSWS-322-401", "path": "/courses/30409/sections/401", "id": "30409-401", "aliases": ["GSWS-322-401", "CINE-322-401"]}]}, "id": 30409, "aliases": ["GSWS-322", "CINE-322"]}
