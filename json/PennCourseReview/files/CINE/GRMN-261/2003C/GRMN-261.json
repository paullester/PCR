{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2302"}, "description": "From the 1922 silent film \"Hungry Hearts\" through the first \"talkie,\" \"The Jazz Singer,\" produced in 1927, and beyond \"Schindler's List,\" Jewish characters have confronted the problems of their Jewishness on the silver screen for a general American audience. Alongside this Hollywood tradition of Jewish film, Yiddish film blossomed from independent producers between 1911 and 1939, and interpreted literary masterpieces, from Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" to Sholom Aleichem's \"Teyve the Dairyman,\" primarily for an immigrant, urban Jewish audience. In this course, we will study a number of films and their literary sources (in fiction and drama), focusing on English language and Yiddish films within the framework of three dilemmas of interpretation: a) the different ways we \"read\" literature and film, b) the various ways that the media of fiction, drama, and film \"translate\" Jewish culture, and c) how these translations of Jewish culture affect and are affected by their implied audience. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "JEWISH FILMS & LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4216/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "JEWISH FILMS & LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-261-401", "path": "/courses/4216/sections/401", "id": "4216-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-261-401", "FILM-251-401", "ENGL-287-401", "JWST-261-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/4216/sections/401/reviews/596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN", "first_name": "KATHRYN ANN", "last_name": "HELLERSTEIN", "id": "596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN", "name": "KATHRYN ANN HELLERSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "4216-401-596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-261", "path": "/courses/4216", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4216/sections", "values": [{"name": "JEWISH FILMS & LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-261-401", "path": "/courses/4216/sections/401", "id": "4216-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-261-401", "FILM-251-401", "ENGL-287-401", "JWST-261-401"]}]}, "id": 4216, "aliases": ["GRMN-261", "FILM-251", "ENGL-287", "JWST-261"]}
