{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5743"}, "description": "Students will learn the history of ecology in media and create works that inform the public about ecological policy questions, considering different institutions that must be navigated along the way: information sources to funding, production, and reception. We'll consider the grant proposals to fund a documentary film and placing op-eds in magazines and newspapers and experiments in online media. We will consider works such as Pare Lorentz's 1938 film The River to Silent Spring and Al Gore's various endeavors. We will talk with filmmakers such as Josh Fox, director of Gasland. We will take a specific issue, such as plastic waste, and look at examples of advocacy across different media platforms, from photography showing the carcasses of albatross chicks with stomachs burst full of plastic scraps to documentaries about the plastic zone in the Pacific--analyzing the rhetorical strategies and aesthetic and practical effects of different approaches. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "Documentary Media and Ecological Advocacy", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31068/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.20", "rCourseQuality": "1.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.20"}, "section": {"name": "Documentary Media and Ecological Advocacy", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "STSC-262-601", "path": "/courses/31068/sections/601", "id": "31068-601", "aliases": ["STSC-262-601", "CINE-262-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/31068/sections/601/reviews/4598-JASON-J--ZUZGA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4598-JASON-J--ZUZGA", "first_name": "JASON J.", "last_name": "ZUZGA", "id": "4598-JASON-J--ZUZGA", "name": "JASON J.
