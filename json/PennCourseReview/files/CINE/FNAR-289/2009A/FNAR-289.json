Real world techniques such as stop-motion, claymation, hand-drawn and multi-plane animation will be practiced in the studio. Other techniques, such as keyframe animation, editing and blue-screen composition compositing will be practiced in the digital labs. Both production teams and individuals will create short mixed-media animations in form, material and time. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15757/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.70", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/15757/sections/401", "id": "15757-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401", "CINE-289-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/15757/sections/401/reviews/4326-LELAND-E-BURKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4326-LELAND-E-BURKE", "first_name": "LELAND E", "last_name": "BURKE", "id": "4326-LELAND-E-BURKE", "name": "LELAND E BURKE"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "15757-401-4326-LELAND-E-BURKE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-289", "path": "/courses/15757", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15757/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/15757/sections/401", "id": "15757-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401", "CINE-289-401"]}]}, "id": 15757, "aliases": ["FNAR-289", "FNAR-589", "CINE-289"]}
