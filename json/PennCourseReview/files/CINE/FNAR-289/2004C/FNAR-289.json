Real world techniques such as stop-motion, claymation, hand-drawn and multi-plane animation will be practiced in the studio. Other techniques, such as keyframe animation, editing and blue-screen composition compositing will be practiced in the digital labs. Both production teams and individuals will create short mixed-media animations in form, material and time. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5338/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.11", "rDifficulty": "2.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/5338/sections/401", "id": "5338-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/5338/sections/401/reviews/2480-PAUL-S--FIERLINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2480-PAUL-S--FIERLINGER", "first_name": "PAUL S.", "last_name": "FIERLINGER", "id": "2480-PAUL-S--FIERLINGER", "name": "PAUL S.
