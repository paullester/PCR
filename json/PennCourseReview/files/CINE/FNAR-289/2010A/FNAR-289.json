{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1836"}, "description": "This animation course fuses hands-on studio drawing, modeling, and cinematic processes with digital tools. Real world techniques such as stop-motion, claymation, hand-drawn and multi-plane animation will be practiced in the studio. Other techniques, such as keyframe animation, editing and blue-screen composition compositing will be practiced in the digital labs. Both production teams and individuals will create short mixed-media animations in form, material and time. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26049/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/26049/sections/401", "id": "26049-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "CINE-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/26049/sections/401/reviews/4326-LELAND-E-BURKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4326-LELAND-E-BURKE", "first_name": "LELAND E", "last_name": "BURKE", "id": "4326-LELAND-E-BURKE", "name": "LELAND E BURKE"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "26049-401-4326-LELAND-E-BURKE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/26049/sections/401", "id": "26049-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "CINE-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/26049/sections/401/reviews/4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY", "first_name": "ERINN E", "last_name": "HAGERTY", "id": "4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY", "name": "ERINN E HAGERTY"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "26049-401-4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-289", "path": "/courses/26049", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26049/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/26049/sections/401", "id": "26049-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "CINE-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}]}, "id": 26049, "aliases": ["FNAR-289", "CINE-289", "FNAR-589"]}
