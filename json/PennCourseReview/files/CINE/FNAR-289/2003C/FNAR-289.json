Real world techniques such as stop-motion, claymation, hand-drawn and multi-plane animation will be practiced in the studio. Other techniques, such as keyframe animation, editing and blue-screen composition compositing will be practiced in the digital labs. Both production teams and individuals will create short mixed-media animations in form, material and time. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4130/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/4130/sections/401", "id": "4130-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/4130/sections/401/reviews/498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY", "first_name": "JOSHUA", "last_name": "MOSLEY", "id": "498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY", "name": "JOSHUA MOSLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "4130-401-498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-289", "path": "/courses/4130", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4130/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/4130/sections/401", "id": "4130-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}]}, "id": 4130, "aliases": ["FNAR-289", "FNAR-589"]}
