One student elaborated that the course, \u201coffers great experience and skills for doing any time-based art.\u201d However, other students expressed that they were generally dissatisfied with the content of the course and the way in which it was presented. In particular, one student explained that, \u201cclass time was just spent watching music clips, or sitting in 3 hour weekly, boring critiques.\u201d \r\n\r\nThere were not many comments on the instructor in this course.  One student felt the instruction was \u201cawesome,\u201d while another felt that although Professor Hagerty was \u201csometimes amusing to watch,\u201d Professor Hagerty\u2019s comments were less than constructive.
