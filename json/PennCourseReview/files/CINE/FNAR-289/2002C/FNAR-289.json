Real world techniques such as stop-motion, claymation, hand-drawn and multi-plane animation will be practiced in the studio. Other techniques, such as keyframe animation, editing and blue-screen composition compositing will be practiced in the digital labs. Both production teams and individuals will create short mixed-media animations in form, material and time. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2965/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.83", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/2965/sections/401", "id": "2965-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/2965/sections/401/reviews/498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY", "first_name": "JOSHUA", "last_name": "MOSLEY", "id": "498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY", "name": "JOSHUA MOSLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "2965-401-498-JOSHUA-MOSLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-289", "path": "/courses/2965", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2965/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIXED MEDIA ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-289-401", "path": "/courses/2965/sections/401", "id": "2965-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-289-401", "FNAR-589-401"]}]}, "id": 2965, "aliases": ["FNAR-289", "FNAR-589"]}
