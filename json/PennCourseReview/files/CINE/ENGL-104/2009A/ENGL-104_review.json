Some versions begin with traditional stories or poems, including a sampling of works in translation. Others focus exclusively on modern and contemporary American short fiction or poetry.\r\n\r\nStudents commented that although the assigned books were all American classics that one \u201chadn\u2019t necessarily ever read,\u201d the books focused more on minority feminist literature. The \u201cinsiders and outsiders\u201d theme Professor Park used was subtle and \u201cinteresting,\u201d yet at the same time too \u201ctrite\u201d and \u201cnarrow\u201d. Some students felt that some analyses of the material were forced due to the limiting theme.\r\nStudents described Professor Park as \u201cexcellent at communicating,\u201d stating that she was \u201csincerely committed in making the material interesting to her students.\u201dAccording to the students, Professor Park \u201cloves to teach and wants others to learn.\u201d\r\nThe course was described as \u201cpretty difficult\u201d and \u201ctime-consuming\u201d for students who did not possess a strong reading foundation before taking the course. However, students who took the course as a general requirement stated that the class was \u201cnot too fast, but not boring.\u201d Because the course is graded more on content and ideas rather than writing skills, it was generally recommended for those students who \u201cdon\u2019t have much background in English but (were) still looking for a challenge.\u201d", "num_students": 80, "path": "/courses/15626/sections/001/reviews/2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK", "first_name": "JOSEPHINE NOCK-HEE", "last_name": "PARK", "id": "2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK", "name": "JOSEPHINE NOCK-HEE PARK"}, "num_reviewers": 74, "id": "15626-001-2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK"}]
