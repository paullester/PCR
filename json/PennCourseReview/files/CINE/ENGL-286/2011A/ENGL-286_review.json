Critics have described the writers of this period as outsiders who both developed a uniquely American literary style and questioned stifling convention at every turn. In this class, students bring these forms of independence under close examination, focus on major movements within the \u201cAmerican Renaissance,\u201d and investigate changing notions of democracy, gender, and racial identity. Among other works, students read Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter, Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s short stories, Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Frederick Douglass\u2019s Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, Victor Sejour\u2019s \u201cThe Mulatto,\u201d poems by Emily Dickinson, and Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick. &#8232;&#8232;Students generally thought that the course provided room for great class discussion.
