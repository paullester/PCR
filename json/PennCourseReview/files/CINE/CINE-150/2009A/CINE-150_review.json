This introductory course in television studies begins with an overview of the medium\u2019s history and explores how technical and industrial changes correspond to developing conventions of genre, programming, and aesthetics. Along the way, it involves analysis of key concepts and theoretical debates that shaped the field. In particular, it focuses on approaches to textual analysis in combination with industry research, and critical engagements with the political, social and cultural dimensions of television as popular culture.\r\n\r\nMost students found the course material \u201cvery interesting.\u201d One wrote that it included \u201c[v]ery in-depth coverage of the history of broadcasting and television.\u201d The same student also stated, \u201cwe stayed on topics for too long,\u201d while another complained that \u201cthe material was somewhat dry.\u201d Several comments called for \u201cmuch more discussion in class.\u201d Students felt that they learned a moderate amount from this course.\r\n\r\nMost found that Professor Johnson was a good lecturer and one wrote that \u201clecture was always worthwhile.\u201d Others explained, however, that the professor \u201ccould have presented the information in a [better] way to keep attention during the class period.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe difficulty and amount of work required by this course was low.
