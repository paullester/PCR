{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3180"}, "description": "This course focuses on the artistic ways in which the city-be it Jerusalem, Haifa or Nazareth-is represented in Israeli literature and film. The emotional and physical connection between the writer or director and his/her place of dwelling is transformed in the artistic work. The depiction of the city in prose, poetry and film reflects the inner world as well as ideological and political conflicts. The \"city\" may become a locus for national expression, of gender identification, or even of pure aesthetic enchantment. We will analyze how, in a film split between Tel Aviv and Tiberias, Shlomo Zarhin pays homage to his hometown, how the Carmel Mountain and Haifa bay allow Yehudit Katzir to expresses the complex bond with her mother; how the city streets enable Dahlia Ravikovitch and Meir Wieseltier examine questions of national loyalty; and how the Jerusalems of Amos Oz, A.B. Yehoshua and Yehuda Amichai reflect their creators. THere will be 5-6 film screenings. The content of this course changes from year to year and therefore students may take it for credit more than once. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "MOD HEB LIT & CULT TRANS: Israeli Literary Auto/Biographies", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29370/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.91", "rTAQuality": "3.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "1.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39"}, "section": {"name": "MOD HEB LIT & CULT TRANS: Israeli Literary Auto/Biographies", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-159-401", "path": "/courses/29370/sections/401", "id": "29370-401", "aliases": ["NELC-159-401", "COML-282-401", "CINE-159-401", "JWST-102-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/29370/sections/401/reviews/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "first_name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF", "last_name": "GOLD", "id": "63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF GOLD"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "29370-401-63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-159", "path": "/courses/29370", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29370/sections", "values": [{"name": "MOD HEB LIT & CULT TRANS: Israeli Literary Auto/Biographies", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-159-401", "path": "/courses/29370/sections/401", "id": "29370-401", "aliases": ["NELC-159-401", "COML-282-401", "CINE-159-401", "JWST-102-401"]}]}, "id": 29370, "aliases": ["NELC-159", "COML-282", "CINE-159", "JWST-102"]}
