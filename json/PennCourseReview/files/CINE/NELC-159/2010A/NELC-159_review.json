Themes include conflicts, personal traumas, and nostalgia. Additionally, the course analyzes how film, poetry and prose use their respective languages to reconstruct the image of childhood; it discusses the authors\u2019 and directors\u2019 struggle to penetrate the psyche of a child and to retrieve fragments of past events, both personal and historical. There are five to six film screenings. \r\n\r\nAll students showed a moderate concern for the general structure of the course. Many students stated that the class was too big for in-depth discussions and suggested having \u201ctoo much to cover but not enough time to cover it\u201d as the main reason. Although many students enjoyed all the assigned readings which were able to \u201creally open [their] eyes to new ideas, concepts, and perspectives,\u201d some students also thought that some of the readings did not seem to fit the course theme, but \u201cwere stretched to fit it.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Gold, according to students, was \u201cable to stimulate interesting discussions, be incredibly informative, and also be incredibly entertaining\u201d at the same time. Most students described her as \u201cknowledgeable\u201d and \u201cspirited.\u201d Students often stated that the professor \u201csometimes seemed to incorporate her own thoughts into discussions,\u201d keeping students\u2019 actual opinions from being heard in class discussions.\r\n\r\nThe content of this course changes from year to year. Therefore, students may take the class for credit more than once. This course was recommended for majors and non-majors alike.", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/26476/sections/401/reviews/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "first_name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF", "last_name": "GOLD", "id": "63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF GOLD"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "26476-401-63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD"}]
