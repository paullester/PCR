{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3240"}, "description": "This course studies the cinematic representation of civil wars, ethnic conflicts, nationalistic doctrines, and genocidal policies. The focus is on the violent developments that took place in Russia and on the Balkans after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and were conditioned by the new geopolitical dynamics that the fall of communism had already created. We study media broadcasts, documentaries, feature films representing the Eastern, as well as the Western perspective. The films include masterpieces such as \"Time of the Gypsies\", \"Underground\", \"Prisoner of the Mountains\", \"Before the Rain\", \"Behind Enemy Lines\", and others. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ETHNIC CONFLICT IN FILM: NAT/ETHNIC CONFLICT FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26737/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.47", "rWorkRequired": "1.08", "rInstructorAccess": "2.36", "rReadingsValue": "1.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.18", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "ETHNIC CONFLICT IN FILM: NAT/ETHNIC CONFLICT FILM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "RUSS-430-601", "path": "/courses/26737/sections/601", "id": "26737-601", "aliases": ["RUSS-430-601", "CINE-430-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/26737/sections/601/reviews/1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "first_name": "VLADISLAV T.", "last_name": "TODOROV", "id": "1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "name": "VLADISLAV T.
