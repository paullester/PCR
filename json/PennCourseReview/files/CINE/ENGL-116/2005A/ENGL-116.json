{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/400"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10317/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.54", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/10317/sections/401", "id": "10317-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "FILM-116-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/10317/sections/401/reviews/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "first_name": "MARC", "last_name": "LAPADULA", "id": "431-MARC-LAPADULA", "name": "MARC LAPADULA"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "10317-401-431-MARC-LAPADULA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.81", "rCourseQuality": "3.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-402", "path": "/courses/10317/sections/402", "id": "10317-402", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-402", "FILM-116-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/10317/sections/402/reviews/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "first_name": "MARC", "last_name": "LAPADULA", "id": "431-MARC-LAPADULA", "name": "MARC LAPADULA"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "10317-402-431-MARC-LAPADULA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-116", "path": "/courses/10317", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10317/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/10317/sections/401", "id": "10317-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "FILM-116-401"]}, {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-402", "path": "/courses/10317/sections/402", "id": "10317-402", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-402", "FILM-116-402"]}]}, "id": 10317, "aliases": ["ENGL-116", "FILM-116"]}
