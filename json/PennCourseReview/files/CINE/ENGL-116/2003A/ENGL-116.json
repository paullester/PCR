{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/400"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1557/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.39", "rDifficulty": "2.39", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.72", "rWorkRequired": "2.72", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.39", "rCommAbility": "3.61", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-301", "path": "/courses/1557/sections/301", "id": "1557-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/1557/sections/301/reviews/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "first_name": "MARC", "last_name": "LAPADULA", "id": "431-MARC-LAPADULA", "name": "MARC LAPADULA"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "1557-301-431-MARC-LAPADULA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.56", "rDifficulty": "2.22", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-302", "path": "/courses/1557/sections/302", "id": "1557-302", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/1557/sections/302/reviews/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "first_name": "MARC", "last_name": "LAPADULA", "id": "431-MARC-LAPADULA", "name": "MARC LAPADULA"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "1557-302-431-MARC-LAPADULA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-116", "path": "/courses/1557", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1557/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-301", "path": "/courses/1557/sections/301", "id": "1557-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-301"]}, {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-302", "path": "/courses/1557/sections/302", "id": "1557-302", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-302"]}]}, "id": 1557, "aliases": ["ENGL-116"]}
