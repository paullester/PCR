{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/400"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5238/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.47", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.87", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/5238/sections/401", "id": "5238-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "FILM-116-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/5238/sections/401/reviews/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "first_name": "MARC", "last_name": "LAPADULA", "id": "431-MARC-LAPADULA", "name": "MARC LAPADULA"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "5238-401-431-MARC-LAPADULA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-116", "path": "/courses/5238", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5238/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/5238/sections/401", "id": "5238-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "FILM-116-401"]}]}, "id": 5238, "aliases": ["ENGL-116", "FILM-116"]}
