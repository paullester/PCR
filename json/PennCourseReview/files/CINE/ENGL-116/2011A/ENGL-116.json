{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/400"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21595/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "1.82", "rStimulateInterest": "3.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.76", "rReadingsValue": "3.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.47", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.84"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/21595/sections/401", "id": "21595-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "CINE-116-401"]}, "comments": "This is a workshop-style course for those who have thought they had a terrific idea for a movie but didn't know where to begin. The class focuses on learning the basic tenets of classical dramatic structure and how this (ideally) will serve as the backbone for the screenplay of the aforementioned terrific idea. Each student should, by the end of the semester, have at least thirty pages of a screenplay completed. Classic and not-so-classic screenplays will be required reading for every class, and students will also become acquainted with how the business of selling and producing one's screenplay actually happens. &#8232;&#8232;Students generally loved this course.
