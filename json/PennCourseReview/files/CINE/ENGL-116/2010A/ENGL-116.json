{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/400"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25924/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.76", "rCourseQuality": "3.81", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.35", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.81"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/25924/sections/401", "id": "25924-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "CINE-116-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/25924/sections/401/reviews/3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "first_name": "KATHLEEN DEMARCO", "last_name": "VAN CLEVE", "id": "3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "name": "KATHLEEN DEMARCO VAN CLEVE"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "25924-401-3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-116", "path": "/courses/25924", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25924/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-116-401", "path": "/courses/25924/sections/401", "id": "25924-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-116-401", "CINE-116-401"]}]}, "id": 25924, "aliases": ["ENGL-116", "CINE-116"]}
