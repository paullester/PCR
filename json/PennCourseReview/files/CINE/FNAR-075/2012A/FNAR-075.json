{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5414"}, "description": "This course presents an in-depth look at the storytelling power of image and sound in both narrative and documentary motion pictures. Students apply a theoretical framework in ongoing workshops, exploring practical approaches to picture editing and sound design. Students edit scenes with a variety of aesthetic approaches, and create story-driven soundtracks with the use of sound FX, dialogue replacement, foleys, music and mixing. Students not only learn critical skills that expand creative possibilities, but also broaden their understanding of the critical relationship between image and sound. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "IMAGE AND SOUND EDITING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27382/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rTAQuality": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.06", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "IMAGE AND SOUND EDITING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-075-401", "path": "/courses/27382/sections/401", "id": "27382-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-075-401", "CINE-075-401", "FNAR-675-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/27382/sections/401/reviews/6091-DAVID-W-NOVACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6091-DAVID-W-NOVACK", "first_name": "DAVID W", "last_name": "NOVACK", "id": "6091-DAVID-W-NOVACK", "name": "DAVID W NOVACK"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "27382-401-6091-DAVID-W-NOVACK"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rTAQuality": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.06", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "IMAGE AND SOUND EDITING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-075-401", "path": "/courses/27382/sections/401", "id": "27382-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-075-401", "CINE-075-401", "FNAR-675-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/27382/sections/401/reviews/6092-NANCY-I-LEVY-NOVACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6092-NANCY-I-LEVY-NOVACK", "first_name": "NANCY I", "last_name": "LEVY-NOVACK", "id": "6092-NANCY-I-LEVY-NOVACK", "name": "NANCY I LEVY-NOVACK"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "27382-401-6092-NANCY-I-LEVY-NOVACK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-075", "path": "/courses/27382", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27382/sections", "values": [{"name": "IMAGE AND SOUND EDITING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-075-401", "path": "/courses/27382/sections/401", "id": "27382-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-075-401", "CINE-075-401", "FNAR-675-401"]}]}, "id": 27382, "aliases": ["FNAR-075", "CINE-075", "FNAR-675"]}
