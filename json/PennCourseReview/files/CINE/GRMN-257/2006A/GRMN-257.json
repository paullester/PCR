As cinema enthusiasts, Goebbels and Hitler were among the first to realize the important ideological potential of film as a mass medium and saw to it that Germany remained a cinema powerhouse producing more than 1000 films during the Nazi era. This course explores the world of Nazi cinema ranging from infamous propaganda pieces such as The Triumph of the Will and The Eternal Jew to entertainments by important directors such as Pabst and Douglas Sirk. More than sixty years later, Nazi Cinema challenges us to grapple with issues of more subtle ideological insinuation than we might think. The course also includes film responses to developments in Germany by exiled German directors (Lubitsch, Wilder). All lectures and readings in English. Weekly screenings with subtitles. \n\nThis course explores the world of Nazi cinema ranging from infamous propaganda pieces such as \"The Triumph of the Will\" and \"The Eternal Jew\" to entertainments by important directors such as Helmut Kaeutner and Douglas Sirk.
