{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3361"}, "description": "This course offers students an opportunity to explore the relation between social institutions and culture, particularly how such institutions structure contemporary human society. Specific versions of this course such as \"Copyright and Culture,\" for example, teach students the specific concepts and principles of legal and literary analysis while exploring the history of how discrete interpretive systems have overlapped in their jurisdictional claims, have shared specific values while rejecting others, and have repeatedly come into conflict with one another over the definition, status, and function of art and intellectual property. In all its versions, this course will provide students with specific tools to understand and evaluate the behavior of human beings in contemporary cultures. At the same time, the subject matter of the course will render the conflict between different social institutions and between their different interpretive methods its centerpiece. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of our current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: DISABILITY NARRATIVE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25920/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.02", "rDifficulty": "2.49", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.37", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: DISABILITY NARRATIVE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-105-401", "path": "/courses/25920/sections/401", "id": "25920-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-105-401", "GSOC-105-401"]}, "comments": "This course will introduce key questions in the field of disability studies, including representation, stigma, access, civil rights, health care, institutionalization, employment, illness and disability, and conceptions of the human. It will also cover how disability is inflected by other dimensions of identity including race, class, gender, and sexuality. It will focus on disability and literature, with attention to questions of framing and narrative strategy. The literature will consist of a range of twentieth-century novels, memoirs, and autobiographies. Readings may include: Helen Keller, The Story of My Life; Carson McCullers, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter; Katherine Butler Hathaway, The Little Locksmith; Audre Lorde, The Cancer Journals; Ken Kesey, One Flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest; William Styron, Darkness Visible; Simi Linton, My Body Politic; Katherine Dunn, Geek Love; Eli Clare, Exile and Pride; Terry Galloway, Mean Little Deaf Queer.\r\n\r\nAll the students were completely satisfied with this course, labeling it \u201camazing\u201d and a \u201cfavorite class at Penn.\u201d The readings were \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cimportant,\u201d and \u201cunique.\u201d One student felt that though the \u201clarge lecture size can impede somewhat on having deep discussions,\u201d the \u201clectures were incredible.\u201d However, there was no \u201cactive participation.\u201d Overall, students claimed to have learned \u201cinformation that goes beyond just the English readings\u201d and learned things that they \u201cnever went into the course expecting to learn.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Love is \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cextremely passionate.\u201d She is very \u201centhusiastic about the material and was able to stimulate interest in the subject.\u201d Students agree she is a \u201cgood lecturer\u201d and \u201capproached the subject of disabled studies with sensitivity and enthusiasm.\u201d Students are not short of complimentary adjectives to describe Professor Love. She is \u201caccessible to discuss any questions\u201d and is \u201cvery willing to help on papers.\u201d\r\n\r\nVery few students discussed the amount of assigned work, though one student noted \u201cthe course was intense because of the amount of readings\u201d assigned. However, the students seemed satisfied with other aspects of the course, though one felt that the \u201cgrading system seemed a bit arbitrary and rather difficult for an introductory English class.\u201d This course fulfills the Humanities and Social Science Sector.\r\n", "num_students": 66, "path": "/courses/25920/sections/401/reviews/2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "first_name": "HEATHER K.", "last_name": "LOVE", "id": "2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "name": "HEATHER K.
