{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3361"}, "description": "This course offers students an opportunity to explore the relation between social institutions and culture, particularly how such institutions structure contemporary human society. Specific versions of this course such as \"Copyright and Culture,\" for example, teach students the specific concepts and principles of legal and literary analysis while exploring the history of how discrete interpretive systems have overlapped in their jurisdictional claims, have shared specific values while rejecting others, and have repeatedly come into conflict with one another over the definition, status, and function of art and intellectual property. In all its versions, this course will provide students with specific tools to understand and evaluate the behavior of human beings in contemporary cultures. At the same time, the subject matter of the course will render the conflict between different social institutions and between their different interpretive methods its centerpiece. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of our current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: THE WORLD OF WORK", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27303/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.47", "rCommAbility": "3.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: THE WORLD OF WORK", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ENGL-105-601", "path": "/courses/27303/sections/601", "id": "27303-601", "aliases": ["ENGL-105-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/27303/sections/601/reviews/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "first_name": "DEBORAH S", "last_name": "BURNHAM", "id": "437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "name": "DEBORAH S BURNHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "27303-601-437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-105", "path": "/courses/27303", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27303/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: THE WORLD OF WORK", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ENGL-105-601", "path": "/courses/27303/sections/601", "id": "27303-601", "aliases": ["ENGL-105-601"]}]}, "id": 27303, "aliases": ["ENGL-105"]}
