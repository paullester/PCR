These experiments in literature produced a wildly exotic mix of fiction and poetry, from Poe\u2019s thrilling accounts of the edge of the known world, to modern classics like Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse.  Along the way, these writers interrogated the role of fiction and language in the practice of science, and the relationship between objectivity, interrogation, and introspection.  Using a variety of perspectives, from Romantic theories of sensation, to nineteenth-century theories of mind, to theoretical physics, this course examines how literature can model formal experimentation.  In addition to the weekly seminars, the class involves several brief essays.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201creally interesting\u201d and one worth taking at Penn. &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Griffiths to be \u201centhusiastic,\u201d \u201ccompetent,\u201d and \u201cengaging\u201d in lecture, and \u201cvery approachable\u201d at any time outside of class. Majors and non-majors alike felt that he was able to stimulate class interest. Though students found him \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d some felt that \u201cit was difficult for him to relay the subject matter in an understandable way\u201d during lecture. Nevertheless, he had a good connection with students; one student commented, \u201cI heart Devin Griffiths [...] He is the man.\u201d&#8232;\r\n\r\n&#8232;Although students praised Professor Griffiths, most had issues with the class structure. Most students felt that there were too many readings, which meant that few could be covered in depth and that class discussion sometimes \u201cfelt scattered and disorganized.\u201d Students had split opinions about the weekly response papers and quizzes. Some felt that they were good for keeping \u201cup-to-date\u201d with the readings, but others felt that they \u201cdid not necessarily asses whether one had read or not.\u201d One student complained that they \u201cnever received one writing assignment back all semester,\u201d which made it difficult to figure out where they stood in the semester. Overall, students tended to agree that the workload was heavy, but \u201cnever overwhelming.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/22970/sections/001/reviews/5343-DEVIN-S-GRIFFITHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5343-DEVIN-S-GRIFFITHS", "first_name": "DEVIN S", "last_name": "GRIFFITHS", "id": "5343-DEVIN-S-GRIFFITHS", "name": "DEVIN S GRIFFITHS"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "22970-001-5343-DEVIN-S-GRIFFITHS"}]
