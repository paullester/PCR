{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4024"}, "description": "Haikai is a general term used to refer to all of the 'comic' genres in which Matsuo Basho and his disciples worked: haiku/hokku (seventeen-syllable verse), haibun (playful poetic prose), renku (comic linked verse), haiga (haiku painting), and hairon (haiku discussions). The course will explore the contributions of Basho and his disciples to each of these genres. It will function as an introduction to useful aspects of classical Japanese, and, given the allusive nature of haikai, to the reading of Japanese poetry more broadly. All pre-modern texts will be read through the intermediary of modern Japanese, including translations, notes, and commentary by Japanese scholars. The course is thus designed to improve students' reading and translation skills in Japanese. We will compare English translations of major works and examine briefly the social and intellectual contexts behind seventeenth century literature of the za (poetic community) and its experiments with revolutionary new aesthetic standards. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "READING BASHO'S HAIKU", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14312/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.80", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "READING BASHO'S HAIKU", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-151-401", "path": "/courses/14312/sections/401", "id": "14312-401", "aliases": ["EALC-151-401", "JPAN-493-401", "EALC-551-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/14312/sections/401/reviews/4154-HAROL-ELEANOR-KERKHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4154-HAROL-ELEANOR-KERKHAM", "first_name": "HAROL ELEANOR", "last_name": "KERKHAM", "id": "4154-HAROL-ELEANOR-KERKHAM", "name": "HAROL ELEANOR KERKHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "14312-401-4154-HAROL-ELEANOR-KERKHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-151", "path": "/courses/14312", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14312/sections", "values": [{"name": "READING BASHO'S HAIKU", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-151-401", "path": "/courses/14312/sections/401", "id": "14312-401", "aliases": ["EALC-151-401", "JPAN-493-401", "EALC-551-401"]}]}, "id": 14312, "aliases": ["EALC-151", "JPAN-493", "EALC-551"]}
