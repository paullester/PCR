{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2407"}, "description": "This course draws on fictional, dramatic and cinematic representations of Russian history based on Russian as well as non-Russian sources and interpretations. The analysis targets major modes of imagining, such as narrating, showing and reenacting historical events, personae and epochs justified by different, historically mutating ideological postulates and forms of national self-consciousness. Common stereotypes of picturing Russia from \"foreign\" perspectives draw special attention. The discussion involves the following themes and outstanding figures: the mighty autocrats Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great; the tragic ruler Boris Godunov; the brazen rebel and royal impostor Pugachev; the notorious Rasputin, his uncanny powers, sex-appeal, and court machinations; Lenin and the October Revolution; images of war; times of construction and times of collapse of the Soviet Colossus. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "RUSSIAN HISTORY IN FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5864/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "1.68", "rStimulateInterest": "2.48", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.84", "rWorkRequired": "1.36", "rInstructorAccess": "2.76", "rReadingsValue": "2.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "2.72", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "RUSSIAN HISTORY IN FILM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-275-401", "path": "/courses/5864/sections/401", "id": "5864-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-275-401", "FILM-253-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/5864/sections/401/reviews/1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "first_name": "VLADISLAV T.", "last_name": "TODOROV", "id": "1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "name": "VLADISLAV T.
