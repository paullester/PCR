{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3177"}, "description": "In the past two decades, films from the Middle East have gained exceptional international reception. This course is designed to explore the reasons behind this reception through a study of the prevalent social, political, and historical themes and issues in Middle Eastern cinema. Questions such as women's laws, literature and its function, familial issues and gender roles, historical legacies and political tensions, and religion, will be discussed. This course assumes no previous knowledge of film studies or languages of the region. Films from Israel, the Arab World, Turkey, and Iran will be shown in subtitled versions. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "MIDDLE EASTERN CINEMA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20551/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "1.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "MIDDLE EASTERN CINEMA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-119-401", "path": "/courses/20551/sections/401", "id": "20551-401", "aliases": ["NELC-119-401", "COML-119-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/20551/sections/401/reviews/2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR", "first_name": "PARDIS", "last_name": "MINUCHEHR", "id": "2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR", "name": "PARDIS MINUCHEHR"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "20551-401-2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-119", "path": "/courses/20551", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20551/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIDDLE EASTERN CINEMA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-119-401", "path": "/courses/20551/sections/401", "id": "20551-401", "aliases": ["NELC-119-401", "COML-119-401"]}]}, "id": 20551, "aliases": ["NELC-119", "COML-119"]}
