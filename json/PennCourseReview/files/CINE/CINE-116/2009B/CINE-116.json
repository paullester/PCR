{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4476"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16641/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-910", "path": "/courses/16641/sections/910", "id": "16641-910", "aliases": ["CINE-116-910", "ENGL-116-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/16641/sections/910/reviews/4628-JEFFREY-S-RUSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4628-JEFFREY-S-RUSH", "first_name": "JEFFREY S", "last_name": "RUSH", "id": "4628-JEFFREY-S-RUSH", "name": "JEFFREY S RUSH"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "16641-910-4628-JEFFREY-S-RUSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-116", "path": "/courses/16641", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16641/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-910", "path": "/courses/16641/sections/910", "id": "16641-910", "aliases": ["CINE-116-910", "ENGL-116-910"]}]}, "id": 16641, "aliases": ["CINE-116", "ENGL-116"]}
