{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4476"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27135/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "2.85", "rReadingsValue": "2.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.31", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-401", "path": "/courses/27135/sections/401", "id": "27135-401", "aliases": ["CINE-116-401", "ENGL-116-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/27135/sections/401/reviews/3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "first_name": "KATHLEEN DEMARCO", "last_name": "VAN CLEVE", "id": "3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "name": "KATHLEEN DEMARCO VAN CLEVE"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "27135-401-3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.15", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-402", "path": "/courses/27135/sections/402", "id": "27135-402", "aliases": ["CINE-116-402", "ENGL-116-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/27135/sections/402/reviews/5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ", "first_name": "KEIR A", "last_name": "POLITZ", "id": "5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ", "name": "KEIR A POLITZ"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "27135-402-5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-116", "path": "/courses/27135", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27135/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-401", "path": "/courses/27135/sections/401", "id": "27135-401", "aliases": ["CINE-116-401", "ENGL-116-401"]}, {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-402", "path": "/courses/27135/sections/402", "id": "27135-402", "aliases": ["CINE-116-402", "ENGL-116-402"]}]}, "id": 27135, "aliases": ["CINE-116", "ENGL-116"]}
