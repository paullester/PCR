{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4476"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21435/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-402", "path": "/courses/21435/sections/402", "id": "21435-402", "aliases": ["CINE-116-402", "ENGL-116-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/21435/sections/402/reviews/5311-CARL-M-HABER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5311-CARL-M-HABER", "first_name": "CARL M", "last_name": "HABER", "id": "5311-CARL-M-HABER", "name": "CARL M HABER"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "21435-402-5311-CARL-M-HABER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-116", "path": "/courses/21435", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21435/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-402", "path": "/courses/21435/sections/402", "id": "21435-402", "aliases": ["CINE-116-402", "ENGL-116-402"]}]}, "id": 21435, "aliases": ["CINE-116", "ENGL-116"]}
