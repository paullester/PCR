{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4476"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28308/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-910", "path": "/courses/28308/sections/910", "id": "28308-910", "aliases": ["CINE-116-910", "ENGL-116-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/28308/sections/910/reviews/5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ", "first_name": "KEIR A", "last_name": "POLITZ", "id": "5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ", "name": "KEIR A POLITZ"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "28308-910-5725-KEIR-A-POLITZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-116", "path": "/courses/28308", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28308/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-910", "path": "/courses/28308/sections/910", "id": "28308-910", "aliases": ["CINE-116-910", "ENGL-116-910"]}]}, "id": 28308, "aliases": ["CINE-116", "ENGL-116"]}
