{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4476"}, "description": "This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production. Several classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating \"believable\" cinematic dialogue, plot development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17114/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-601", "path": "/courses/17114/sections/601", "id": "17114-601", "aliases": ["CINE-116-601", "ENGL-116-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/17114/sections/601/reviews/3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "first_name": "KATHLEEN DEMARCO", "last_name": "VAN CLEVE", "id": "3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE", "name": "KATHLEEN DEMARCO VAN CLEVE"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "17114-601-3285-KATHLEEN-DEMARCO-VAN-CLEVE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-116", "path": "/courses/17114", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17114/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CINE-116-601", "path": "/courses/17114/sections/601", "id": "17114-601", "aliases": ["CINE-116-601", "ENGL-116-601"]}]}, "id": 17114, "aliases": ["CINE-116", "ENGL-116"]}
