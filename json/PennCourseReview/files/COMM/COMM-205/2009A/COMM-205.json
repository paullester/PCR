{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4204"}, "description": "This seminar is premised on the understanding that technology, society, law, and are in constant interplay, each reflecting, shaping, and reacting to the other. Values are embedded in the design choices of different technologies and are translated into, and changed by, law and society. In this class, we will integrate theories from law, communication, ethics, sociology, media theory, science and technology studies, and information science to build a conceptual framework for considering technology as a conduit for change. The The latter half of the course will focus on case studies such as iTunes, Wikipedia, and Facebook as a pivot point for discussing digital rights management, First Amendment speech, privacy, and reputation in an information age. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "VALUES IN TECHNOLOGY: TECHNOLOGY, SOCIETY, LAW, VALUES, AND DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15534/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "2.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "VALUES IN TECHNOLOGY: TECHNOLOGY, SOCIETY, LAW, VALUES, AND DESIGN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-205-301", "path": "/courses/15534/sections/301", "id": "15534-301", "aliases": ["COMM-205-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/15534/sections/301/reviews/4288-ANNE-H--CHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4288-ANNE-H--CHEN", "first_name": "ANNE H.", "last_name": "CHEN", "id": "4288-ANNE-H--CHEN", "name": "ANNE H.
