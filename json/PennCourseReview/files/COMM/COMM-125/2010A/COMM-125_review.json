They believed that lectures were disorganized and had difficulty taking notes. Students also complained that the lectures were not made available to them online. However, they enjoyed recitations and thought the TAs were very effective. \r\nOpinions about Professor Moehler were mixed. Some students said that she was an effective lecturer, while others thought that she spent too much time reading off of the slides. She was not a very accessible professor. \r\nThis class is recommended for majors.
