Several students described the course as \u201cdull\u201d and with \u201cthe potential to be much more interesting.\u201d Many students commented that the course only covered the \u201cbasics\u201d and \u201coversimplified\u201d complex theories. A few students commented on the redundancy of the information covered in the readings, lectures, and recitations, causing some students to feel that attendance was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d One student reported that the course material itself was \u201cinteresting\u201d and allowed them to \u201clearn a lot about mass media,\u201d and another noted that it provided a \u201cnice overview for a lot of communications-related topics.\u201d Recitations were reported to be more enjoyable than lectures. The course includes a midterm, final exam, and a paper.&#8232;&#8232;Students had mixed opinions about Professor Moehler. While one student described her as \u201centhusiastic and engaging,\u201d others faulted her for creating the dullness that characterized the course in most students\u2019 opinions.

This course fulfills the Society sector and is a requirement for the Communications major. Upperclassmen who took the course described it as easy. Students reported that the course \u201cheld students\u2019 hands the entire way\u201d and \u201cspoon-fed\u201d everything to them. While some students felt that the course was \u201cfair\u201d and described class expectations and goals as \u201cclearly outlined,\u201d several other students were frustrated by what they felt was a discrepancy between the oversimplification of the lectures and paper and the difficulty of the exam. One student described the exam as \u201castronomically harder\u201d than the readings and information discussed, and another agreed that what was learned in class had to be \u201cstretched for the exam.\u201d However, nearly all students agreed that the paper was \u201cpretty straightforward.\u201d One student noted that a \u201chelpful\u201d study guide was provided for both the midterm and final.
