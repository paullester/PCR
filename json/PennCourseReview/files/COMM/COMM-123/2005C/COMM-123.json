{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/292"}, "description": "Popular culture has been variously dismissed as mere trivia, \"just entertainment;\" it has been condemned as propaganda, a tool of mass deception; and its consumers have been dubbed fashion victims and couch potatoes. This course considers these critiques, as well as those that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. We will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture, including its effects on how we see ourselves, others, and American life; who makes distinctions between high, middlebrow, and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "COMM & POPULAR CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11597/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.53", "rDifficulty": "2.01", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.05", "rWorkRequired": "2.16", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.91", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "COMM & POPULAR CULTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-123-001", "path": "/courses/11597/sections/001", "id": "11597-001", "aliases": ["COMM-123-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 89, "path": "/courses/11597/sections/001/reviews/1334-KATHERINE-E--SENDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1334-KATHERINE-E--SENDER", "first_name": "KATHERINE E.", "last_name": "SENDER", "id": "1334-KATHERINE-E--SENDER", "name": "KATHERINE E.
