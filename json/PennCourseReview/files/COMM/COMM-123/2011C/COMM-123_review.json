It also examines evaluations that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. This course will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture, including its effects on how we see ourselves, others, and American life; who makes distinctions between high, middlebrow, and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts.\r\n\r\nMost students really enjoyed this \u201cinteresting, entertaining, and thought-provoking\u201d class. Considered by many to be one of the best classes they have taken at Penn, students still claimed that the workload for this course was \u201ca bit much for an introductory Communications course\u201d and that the grading on the tests and papers was \u201charsh.\u201d Overall, students found the readings and lectures \u201cextremely engaging\u201d and claimed that they were \u201cnever bored.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Paxton was viewed by her students as \u201cexciting,\u201d for she \u201cfrequently had the class in laughter.\u201d She was able to keep students awake and present in class because the material and the way it was presented was \u201ceducationally stimulating, while still being entertaining.\u201d Most students also commented on Professor Paxton\u2019s approachability or willingness to help them with the material on her own time. It was noted, however, that she is \u201cdemanding of her students\u201d and \u201cexpects a lot.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course is recommended for students interested in pop culture or communications, but is \u201cchallenging for an introductory course.\u201d Many students felt that they had to work hard to get an A in this class and that the grading was purposefully difficult. With two papers, three tests, and many readings, students often felt overwhelmed with work that ultimately didn\u2019t pay off due to the harsh grading. However, students commented that they generally \u201cenjoyed the readings\u201d and the \u201ccurve for the course helped.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 109, "path": "/courses/24215/sections/001/reviews/1770-FELICITY-PAXTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1770-FELICITY-PAXTON", "first_name": "FELICITY", "last_name": "PAXTON", "id": "1770-FELICITY-PAXTON", "name": "FELICITY PAXTON"}, "num_reviewers": 106, "id": "24215-001-1770-FELICITY-PAXTON"}]
