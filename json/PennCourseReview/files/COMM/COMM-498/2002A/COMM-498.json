{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/307"}, "description": "The main goal of this course is to familiarize students with experiments, quasi-experiments, population-based survey experiments and field experiments as they are widely used in the social sciences. By the end of the course, students will be expected to understand what it is about a study that allows for a strong causal inference. Whether one is reading about studies in a newspaper or reading academic journal articles, it is important to know how to distinguish convincing versus unconving evidence of any given claim. As a final project, students will be expected either to develop their own original experimental design or to analyze the evidence pertaining to a causal claim of their choosing based on what they have learned in class. Throughout the course of the semester, we will also consider how to deal with the issue of causality as it occurs in observational studies, and draw parallels between experimental and observational research. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CONTMP POL PLCY PRESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/307/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.79", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.64", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "CONTMP POL PLCY PRESS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-498-301", "path": "/courses/307/sections/301", "id": "307-301", "aliases": ["COMM-498-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/307/sections/301/reviews/295-ALBERT-HUNT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/295-ALBERT-HUNT", "first_name": "ALBERT", "last_name": "HUNT", "id": "295-ALBERT-HUNT", "name": "ALBERT HUNT"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "307-301-295-ALBERT-HUNT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-498", "path": "/courses/307", "sections": {"path": "/courses/307/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTMP POL PLCY PRESS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-498-301", "path": "/courses/307/sections/301", "id": "307-301", "aliases": ["COMM-498-301"]}]}, "id": 307, "aliases": ["COMM-498"]}
