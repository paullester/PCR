{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4209"}, "description": "This course will examine the nature of local news in the 21st century and the the ways in which local news coverage influences urban policies, the actions of local officials, and the image of the city. The course will begin with an examination of how economic forces influence local news coverage in particular, the importance of political geography. We will look at how suburbanization and the rise of local television newscasts affected metropolitan newspapers in the 20th century, and how the more recent emergence of the Internet now affects what is considered \"local news.\" The class will also consider innovations in local news, including citizen journalism and \"hyperlocalism,\" ,\" blogs and free dailies targeted to youth. At the same time, the course will examine the changing professional values and \"standard operating procedures\" of local journalists in the face of new competition. We will also consider how local news is influenced by the media strategies of local public officials, and how these local officials-in particular, big-city mayors-play a role in the local news media's fortunes. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "LOCAL NEWS MEDIA & URBN: Local News Media and Urban Policy", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19974/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "LOCAL NEWS MEDIA & URBN: Local News Media and Urban Policy", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-336-001", "path": "/courses/19974/sections/001", "id": "19974-001", "aliases": ["COMM-336-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/19974/sections/001/reviews/3249-PHYLLIS-C-KANISS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3249-PHYLLIS-C-KANISS", "first_name": "PHYLLIS C", "last_name": "KANISS", "id": "3249-PHYLLIS-C-KANISS", "name": "PHYLLIS C KANISS"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "19974-001-3249-PHYLLIS-C-KANISS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-336", "path": "/courses/19974", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19974/sections", "values": [{"name": "LOCAL NEWS MEDIA & URBN: Local News Media and Urban Policy", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-336-001", "path": "/courses/19974/sections/001", "id": "19974-001", "aliases": ["COMM-336-001"]}]}, "id": 19974, "aliases": ["COMM-336"]}
