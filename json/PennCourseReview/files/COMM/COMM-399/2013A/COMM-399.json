Its structure and purpose is different from the internship experience. Students must also complete and file a designated form, approved and signed by the supervising faculty member and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies, which includes a topic proposal. This form must be received in the Undergraduate Office during the Add period of the semester during which the independent study will be conducted. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INDEPENDENT STUDY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30111/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "INDEPENDENT STUDY", "sectionnum": "007", "primary_alias": "COMM-399-007", "path": "/courses/30111/sections/007", "id": "30111-007", "aliases": ["COMM-399-007"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/30111/sections/007/reviews/291-DWIGHT-D--EISENHOWER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/291-DWIGHT-D--EISENHOWER", "first_name": "DWIGHT D.", "last_name": "EISENHOWER", "id": "291-DWIGHT-D--EISENHOWER", "name": "DWIGHT D.
