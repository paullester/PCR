{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4925"}, "description": "Media and Politics will examine multiple issues specific to the past and present political media environment in the United States. Focus will be primarily, though not exclusively on the contemporary news media (as opposed to political advertising and other marketing-oriented communications). Topics will include the rise of partisan media, selective exposure, news as entertainment, etc. Reading expectations will be relatively heavy, and under the supervision of the professor, students will be expected to write a research paper on a topic not directly a part of the course material. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MEDIA AND POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21506/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.08", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "MEDIA AND POLITICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-404-401", "path": "/courses/21506/sections/401", "id": "21506-401", "aliases": ["COMM-404-401", "PSCI-404-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/21506/sections/401/reviews/2814-DIANA-C-MUTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2814-DIANA-C-MUTZ", "first_name": "DIANA C", "last_name": "MUTZ", "id": "2814-DIANA-C-MUTZ", "name": "DIANA C MUTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "21506-401-2814-DIANA-C-MUTZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-404", "path": "/courses/21506", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21506/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDIA AND POLITICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-404-401", "path": "/courses/21506/sections/401", "id": "21506-401", "aliases": ["COMM-404-401", "PSCI-404-401"]}]}, "id": 21506, "aliases": ["COMM-404", "PSCI-404"]}
