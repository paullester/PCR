{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5641"}, "description": "This class will survey research and theory on attitudes, persuasion, and behavior change. I have selected readings that highlight important and interesting aspects of this fascinating field. We cover some of the basic concepts of the psychology of attitudes, including attitude structure and measurement at both conscious and unconscious levels. After this introduction, we will review persuasion and propaganda approaches, the role of affect and fear in communication, to finally turn to models that explain behavioral change and allow researchers and practitioners to design ways of modifying recipients' actions. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ATTITUDES AND PERSUASION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30114/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rTAQuality": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.19", "rRecommendMajor": "2.63", "rCourseQuality": "2.38", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "2.19", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "2.69", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "ATTITUDES AND PERSUASION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-406-301", "path": "/courses/30114/sections/301", "id": "30114-301", "aliases": ["COMM-406-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30114/sections/301/reviews/6476-DOLORES-ALBARRACIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6476-DOLORES-ALBARRACIN", "first_name": "DOLORES", "last_name": "ALBARRACIN", "id": "6476-DOLORES-ALBARRACIN", "name": "DOLORES ALBARRACIN"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "30114-301-6476-DOLORES-ALBARRACIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-406", "path": "/courses/30114", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30114/sections", "values": [{"name": "ATTITUDES AND PERSUASION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-406-301", "path": "/courses/30114/sections/301", "id": "30114-301", "aliases": ["COMM-406-301"]}]}, "id": 30114, "aliases": ["COMM-406"]}
