{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5530"}, "description": "This undergraduate seminar explores the intersections of communication theory and fine art. The course evolves in three units: the relationship between images and ideas in art-making and art history; curatorial practice as communication and exhibitions as messages; and art institutions as dialogic spaces. We will explore the relationship between semiotics, visual communication, and and art, with attention to contemporary social issues. Several class sessions will take place at local institutions including the Institute for Contemporary Art and the Slought Foundation. For the final project, students will work in groups to re-envision the public art on Penn's campus as dialogic space by creating podcasts, guided walking tours, and/or performances. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SPECIAL TOPICS IN COMM: Non-Profit Media Strategy", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28766/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.56", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.94", "rCourseQuality": "3.65", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.13", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "SPECIAL TOPICS IN COMM: Non-Profit Media Strategy", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-390-001", "path": "/courses/28766/sections/001", "id": "28766-001", "aliases": ["COMM-390-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/28766/sections/001/reviews/5603-JOAN-M-GARRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5603-JOAN-M-GARRY", "first_name": "JOAN M", "last_name": "GARRY", "id": "5603-JOAN-M-GARRY", "name": "JOAN M GARRY"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "28766-001-5603-JOAN-M-GARRY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-390", "path": "/courses/28766", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28766/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPECIAL TOPICS IN COMM: Non-Profit Media Strategy", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-390-001", "path": "/courses/28766/sections/001", "id": "28766-001", "aliases": ["COMM-390-001"]}]}, "id": 28766, "aliases": ["COMM-390"]}
