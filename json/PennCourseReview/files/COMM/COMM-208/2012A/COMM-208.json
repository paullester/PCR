{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5400"}, "description": "Communication is central to health promotion and disease prevention efforts. In this course, students gain a deep understanding of the major theories that guide health communication research and real-world application. A particular focus is placed on how innovative communication technologies are currently being used to change attitudes and behavior. Each week, students will interact with (and critique) new media platforms such as video games, blogs, YouTube channels, and Facebook applications geared towards health. A series of Skype guest lectures provide students with the opportunity to interact with some of the field's leading health communication scholars and scholars and software developers. Students also gain hands on research experience by completing a collaborative final project in which they conduct an online experiment comparing various health messages. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "HEALTH COMM DIGITAL AGE: Health Communication in the Digital Age", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27203/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "1.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.81", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH COMM DIGITAL AGE: Health Communication in the Digital Age", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-208-301", "path": "/courses/27203/sections/301", "id": "27203-301", "aliases": ["COMM-208-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/27203/sections/301/reviews/6076-JOHNNIE-LEE-CHRISTENSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6076-JOHNNIE-LEE-CHRISTENSEN", "first_name": "JOHNNIE LEE", "last_name": "CHRISTENSEN", "id": "6076-JOHNNIE-LEE-CHRISTENSEN", "name": "JOHNNIE LEE CHRISTENSEN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "27203-301-6076-JOHNNIE-LEE-CHRISTENSEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-208", "path": "/courses/27203", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27203/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTH COMM DIGITAL AGE: Health Communication in the Digital Age", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-208-301", "path": "/courses/27203/sections/301", "id": "27203-301", "aliases": ["COMM-208-301"]}]}, "id": 27203, "aliases": ["COMM-208"]}
