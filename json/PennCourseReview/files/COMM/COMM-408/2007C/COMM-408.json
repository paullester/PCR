{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2499"}, "description": "This seminar is designed to investigate the relationships between children's cognitive development and their use of media (i.e., television, computers, the Internet, video games, electronic toys). We will examine normal patterns of children's thinking and how these patterns are situated in children's lives (e.g., contextual factors that mediate cognitive functioning). Then, students will apply these concepts to understand both the creation of and the effects associated with media. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "Children and Media: Cognitive Development", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13077/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "3.23", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "Children and Media: Cognitive Development", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-408-301", "path": "/courses/13077/sections/301", "id": "13077-301", "aliases": ["COMM-408-301"]}, "comments": "Students enjoyed the course, but many left suggestions for the professor.
