{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2498"}, "description": "This course seeks to trace the evolving relationship between new media and the political process from three perspectives: the voter, the political campaigns, and the news media. It will trace these changes beginning with the 1996 presidential campaign and end with the 2010 midterm campaigns and suggest implications going into the 2012 campaign. \n\nIn traditional media research, studies were either about \"what media do to people\" (effects studies) or \"what people do to media\" (Use and Gratifications). This course will discuss how changes in technology in the 21st century re-examines the relationship between media and the audience and how this change in media landscape may affect politics in ways that previous studies never examined and understood before the popularization of the Internet, email, texting, blogging, social media and twitter. Assignments will include: weekly paper and a final paper. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "NEW MEDIA AND POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30110/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rTAQuality": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "2.84", "rWorkRequired": "1.81", "rInstructorAccess": "2.81", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.31", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "NEW MEDIA AND POLITICS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "COMM-397-601", "path": "/courses/30110/sections/601", "id": "30110-601", "aliases": ["COMM-397-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/30110/sections/601/reviews/5327-KENNETH-WINNEG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5327-KENNETH-WINNEG", "first_name": "KENNETH", "last_name": "WINNEG", "id": "5327-KENNETH-WINNEG", "name": "KENNETH WINNEG"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "30110-601-5327-KENNETH-WINNEG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-397", "path": "/courses/30110", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30110/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEW MEDIA AND POLITICS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "COMM-397-601", "path": "/courses/30110/sections/601", "id": "30110-601", "aliases": ["COMM-397-601"]}]}, "id": 30110, "aliases": ["COMM-397"]}
