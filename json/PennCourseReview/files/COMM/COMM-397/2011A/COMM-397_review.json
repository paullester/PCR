The course begins with a broad overview of the main theories of political communication and U.S. political campaigns leading up to 1996, the year the internet debuted in a presidential campaign. It will then follow this evolution from the 1996 presidential campaign through the 2010 midterm campaigns and suggest implications going into the 2012 campaign. In addition, the course will examine issues of new media and activism, governance and transparency.&#8232;Students highly praised this course and said that they learned a lot.
