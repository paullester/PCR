{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4212"}, "description": "This course explores the significance of rituals as communicative events in American culture. We will examine both the \"how\" and the \"what\" of ritual communication and, with the aid of several ritual theorists, we will come to better understand the unique language of ritual. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which rituals contribute to the making and re-making of social groups, be they religious, political, familial or institutional. And we will necessarily attend to the obverse: the ways in which rituals create and perpetuate boundaries between \"us\" and \"them\" and between \"appropriate\" and \"deviant\" social behavior. Starting with birth and ending with death, this course will focus largely on what are called \"lifecycle\" rituals or \"rites de passage\". We will look at rituals that focus on individual transitions -- the quinceanera for example -- as well as those that mark transitions on a far larger scale such as presidential elections. We will explore rituals that unfold at the local level and are experienced \"up close\" as well as those that most Americans experience only via the media. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "RITUAL COMMUNICATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15548/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.59", "rStimulateInterest": "3.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.62", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.23", "rCommAbility": "3.77", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "RITUAL COMMUNICATION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-388-301", "path": "/courses/15548/sections/301", "id": "15548-301", "aliases": ["COMM-388-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/15548/sections/301/reviews/1770-FELICITY-PAXTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1770-FELICITY-PAXTON", "first_name": "FELICITY", "last_name": "PAXTON", "id": "1770-FELICITY-PAXTON", "name": "FELICITY PAXTON"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "15548-301-1770-FELICITY-PAXTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-388", "path": "/courses/15548", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15548/sections", "values": [{"name": "RITUAL COMMUNICATION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-388-301", "path": "/courses/15548/sections/301", "id": "15548-301", "aliases": ["COMM-388-301"]}]}, "id": 15548, "aliases": ["COMM-388"]}
