{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5100"}, "description": "This course offers students the opportunity to explore the relationship between the media industry and the public and the role groups and movements can play in holding the media accountable to serve the public interest. We will wrestle with what that responsibility looks like by engaging the following questions: What obligations do media outlets have to offer fair, accurate, unbiased and inclusive representations in news and entertainment? How do media \"insiders\" understand this responsibility? Is it clear when a talk show host \"crosses the line?\" How do we define balance? Are there really two sides to every issue? What is media advocacy? What does it look like? What are the strategies and tactics employed by media activists? How do media insiders effectively contend with media outsiders lobbying for change? These questions will be explored in historically contextualized ways, using a diverse menu of social and political movements and examining the issues with recourse to all sides of the political spectrum. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Media Advocacy and Social Change", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27214/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.35", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "Media Advocacy and Social Change", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-385-301", "path": "/courses/27214/sections/301", "id": "27214-301", "aliases": ["COMM-385-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/27214/sections/301/reviews/5603-JOAN-M-GARRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5603-JOAN-M-GARRY", "first_name": "JOAN M", "last_name": "GARRY", "id": "5603-JOAN-M-GARRY", "name": "JOAN M GARRY"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "27214-301-5603-JOAN-M-GARRY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-385", "path": "/courses/27214", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27214/sections", "values": [{"name": "Media Advocacy and Social Change", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-385-301", "path": "/courses/27214/sections/301", "id": "27214-301", "aliases": ["COMM-385-301"]}]}, "id": 27214, "aliases": ["COMM-385"]}
