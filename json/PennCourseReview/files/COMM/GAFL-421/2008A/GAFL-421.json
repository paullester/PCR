It will examine the complexities of the Iraq war, Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian issue, and radical Islam, and how foreign correspondents gather the material that goes into their stories. The course is designed for students who want the tools to evaluate news from the Middle East and to understand what goes into producing that news. Assignments will be designed to help students learn how to dissect tough issues and produce essays that go to the core of difficult problems. Trudy Rubin writes the Worldview column for The Philadelphia Inquirer, travels to Iraq and Iran, and has covered the Middle East for thirty years. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "COVERING THE MIDDLE EAST: Reporting on the Middle East: Challenge of World's most Controversial Beat", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20234/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "2.64", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.21", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.79"}, "section": {"name": "COVERING THE MIDDLE EAST: Reporting on the Middle East: Challenge of World's most Controversial Beat", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GAFL-421-401", "path": "/courses/20234/sections/401", "id": "20234-401", "aliases": ["GAFL-421-401", "COMM-421-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/20234/sections/401/reviews/5159-GERTRUDE-S--RUBIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5159-GERTRUDE-S--RUBIN", "first_name": "GERTRUDE S.", "last_name": "RUBIN", "id": "5159-GERTRUDE-S--RUBIN", "name": "GERTRUDE S.
