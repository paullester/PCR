Case studies will cover a diverse set of environmental topics, including the global industrial food system, the environmental impacts of digital communication technologies, political controversy in energy development, corporate greening efforts, environmental journalism and public understandings of scientific risk. Course materials will include interdisciplinary readings - drawn from communication and media studies, political science, geography, the natural sciences and other fields - as well as relevant films, television shows and other multimedia materials. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "Engaging Hearts and Minds: Comm & Citizen Involvement in Public Affairs", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30103/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "Engaging Hearts and Minds: Comm & Citizen Involvement in Public Affairs", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-290-301", "path": "/courses/30103/sections/301", "id": "30103-301", "aliases": ["COMM-290-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/30103/sections/301/reviews/6474-SUSANNA-DILLIPLANE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6474-SUSANNA-DILLIPLANE", "first_name": "SUSANNA", "last_name": "DILLIPLANE", "id": "6474-SUSANNA-DILLIPLANE", "name": "SUSANNA DILLIPLANE"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "30103-301-6474-SUSANNA-DILLIPLANE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-290", "path": "/courses/30103", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30103/sections", "values": [{"name": "Engaging Hearts and Minds: Comm & Citizen Involvement in Public Affairs", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-290-301", "path": "/courses/30103/sections/301", "id": "30103-301", "aliases": ["COMM-290-301"]}]}, "id": 30103, "aliases": ["COMM-290"]}
