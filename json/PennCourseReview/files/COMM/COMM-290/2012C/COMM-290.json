{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5529"}, "description": "This course will examine the role of communication in shaping various forms of citizen involvement in the public sphere, from voting in elections and volunteering for a cause to boy/buycotting and posting on Facebook. What purposes do \"new\" and \"old\" media serve in facilitating (or discouraging) participation? What motivates us, as individual citizens, to participate in efforts to solve pressing social and political issues in society? How do different types of messages influence our emotions (e.g., empathy, fear, enthusiasm), cognitions (e.g., perceptions, beliefs, opinions), and actions (e.g., donating time or money, forwarding/posting messages online, voting, choosing products)? We will combine insights from theoretical models, empirical studies, and real-world examples to explore these and other questions about how communication factors into citizen involvement in the public sphere. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SPECIAL TOPICS IN COMM: Gays, Media and Politics", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28762/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "SPECIAL TOPICS IN COMM: Gays, Media and Politics", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-290-001", "path": "/courses/28762/sections/001", "id": "28762-001", "aliases": ["COMM-290-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/28762/sections/001/reviews/6077-SETH-K--GOLDMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6077-SETH-K--GOLDMAN", "first_name": "SETH K.", "last_name": "GOLDMAN", "id": "6077-SETH-K--GOLDMAN", "name": "SETH K.
