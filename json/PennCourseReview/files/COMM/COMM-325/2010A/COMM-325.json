{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5313"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to examine the role of media in adolescent development and behavior. We will review current research several topic areas and use various theoretical perspectives to consider how adolescent interact with media and how media influence adolescents' self and behavior. The course is divided into 3 sections. First we focus on the adolescent as a consumer/audience by addressing such issues as why adolescence is a unique developmental stage, how adolescents use media, and understanding their media habits with regards to different media and technologies. The next section of the course will be devoted to reviewing relevant theoretical perspectives on how media influence self and behavior, followed by exploring the effects of media across several areas of research including violence, sex, body image, obesity, and smoking. Finally, the course will conclude with a discussion of the potential for media as a positive factor in adolescent lives with an emphasis on media interventions and campaigns for self (e.g. attitudinal) and behavior change. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ADOLESCENT MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25840/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "1.74", "rStimulateInterest": "2.95", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.68", "rWorkRequired": "1.84", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.84", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.21", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.16"}, "section": {"name": "ADOLESCENT MEDIA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-325-301", "path": "/courses/25840/sections/301", "id": "25840-301", "aliases": ["COMM-325-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/25840/sections/301/reviews/3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY", "first_name": "AMY", "last_name": "BLEAKLEY", "id": "3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY", "name": "AMY BLEAKLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "25840-301-3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-325", "path": "/courses/25840", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25840/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADOLESCENT MEDIA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-325-301", "path": "/courses/25840/sections/301", "id": "25840-301", "aliases": ["COMM-325-301"]}]}, "id": 25840, "aliases": ["COMM-325"]}
