{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2255"}, "description": "This course will examine the relationship between the modern American corporation and the media. It will provide an overview of the issues that face corporate leaders, who must manage in a media world that now treats big business as it does politics, sports or entertainment. The course will look at how the new media landscape has changed the roles that Wall Street and Washington, DC play in the ways today's corporations are managed. Through readings, case studies and visiting lecturers from business and journalism, the course will explore the implications of these changes for business and the larger US society. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "THE BUSINESS OF TV: The Business of Television", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7507/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.90", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "1.65", "rRecommendMajor": "1.69", "rCourseQuality": "1.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "1.77", "rReadingsValue": "1.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.17", "rCommAbility": "1.48", "rInstructorQuality": "1.46"}, "section": {"name": "THE BUSINESS OF TV: The Business of Television", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-310-001", "path": "/courses/7507/sections/001", "id": "7507-001", "aliases": ["COMM-310-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/7507/sections/001/reviews/2901-HOWARD-J--BLUMENTHAL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2901-HOWARD-J--BLUMENTHAL", "first_name": "HOWARD J.", "last_name": "BLUMENTHAL", "id": "2901-HOWARD-J--BLUMENTHAL", "name": "HOWARD J.
