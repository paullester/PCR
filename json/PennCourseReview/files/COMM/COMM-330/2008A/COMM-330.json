Readings included social histories of advertising, economic examinations of advertising\\'s role in society, and critical analyses of the ad industry\\'s power over the media. The course relied on readings from multiple sources, but students especially enjoyed the \u201cwonderful\u201d primary textbook \u201cAdvertising and Culture: Theoretical Perspectives\u201d by Mary Cross. \r\n\r\nStudents reported strong positive impressions of the class material. Most of them characterized it as relevant, easily understandable, yet edifying at the same time. \u201cThis course opened my eyes to much of the world of advertising,\u201d one student wrote.  The course required extensive reading (some complained it was too much) for each class. Graded assignments for the course were two exams and one paper.\r\n\r\nIn general, students enjoyed coming to Professor Turow\u2019s lectures, pointing out his \u201cnerdy\u201d in-class jokes, the fact that his lecture material was up-to-date, and his enthusiasm for the subject matter, as ample reason to come to class. \r\n\r\nStudents characterized the course as particularly worthwhile for anyone already interested in advertising, \u201cotherwise, you may hate it.\u201d  Freshmen may wish to consider taking lower-level Communications courses before taking this one: \u201cAs a freshman, I felt challenged in this course. The material was dense, seeing as this wasn\u2019t an introductory course, but I still learned a lot and felt taking a prior Comm class would have helped me.\u201d  Students strongly criticized Professor Turow\u2019s tests. \u201cI really enjoy the class, and understand the material,\u201d one student wrote, \u201cHowever, the exams seem to trick you, and test you on specific random sections rather than broad theories discussed in class.\u201d Many students echoed this sentiment, using words like \u201charsh\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d to characterize the grading of the exams. Some students were also concerned about the standard lecture format, as well as the amount of reading required for the course.\r\n", "num_students": 114, "path": "/courses/19973/sections/001/reviews/287-JOSEPH-G--TUROW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/287-JOSEPH-G--TUROW", "first_name": "JOSEPH G.", "last_name": "TUROW", "id": "287-JOSEPH-G--TUROW", "name": "JOSEPH G.
