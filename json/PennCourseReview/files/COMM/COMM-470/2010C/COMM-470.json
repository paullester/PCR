{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5102"}, "description": "In life as in fashion, either you are in or you are out. Except in life, the inside and the outside are always changing, depending on who makes the rules, where the inside is situated, who is doing the displaying. In this course, we will explore who the freaks are and who who they were, where they can be found, how they came to be defined, and how this changed. Starting with the nineteenth-century freakshow, we move through time charting outsiders and their representations, including male and female hysterics, war wounded, medical \"cases,\" and the mentally ill. As we progress through the twentieth century, will discuss subcultures and alternative communities, thinking through the rise of \"geek chic\" and the dominance of the computer geek as a reversal of traditional trends. We will discuss current models of the exhibition of human types, including bodyworlds and The Learning Channel programming. As we circle around our own moment in time, we will ask: who are the freaks today? This interdisciplinary course will incorporate historical primary source documents, scholarly secondary works, a range of creative materials including films , plays, television shows, and works of art. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "Freaks and Geeks: People on Display", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22884/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.72", "rCourseQuality": "3.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.61", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.61", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "Freaks and Geeks: People on Display", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-470-301", "path": "/courses/22884/sections/301", "id": "22884-301", "aliases": ["COMM-470-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22884/sections/301/reviews/4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "first_name": "SHARRONA HYLA", "last_name": "PEARL", "id": "4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "name": "SHARRONA HYLA PEARL"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "22884-301-4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-470", "path": "/courses/22884", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22884/sections", "values": [{"name": "Freaks and Geeks: People on Display", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-470-301", "path": "/courses/22884/sections/301", "id": "22884-301", "aliases": ["COMM-470-301"]}]}, "id": 22884, "aliases": ["COMM-470"]}
