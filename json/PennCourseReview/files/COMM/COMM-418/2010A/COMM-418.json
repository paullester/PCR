Following a brief look at early cave writing and papyrus, we move to early modern developments in print-making. We will analyze different methods of image reproduction, focusing in particular on the printing press and its social and cultural impact. We will discuss the implications of the printing press for literacy, political life, democracy, the post, and visual culture. We track track changes in print culture through the nineteenth century, thinking about the relationship between the explosion in printed material and the development of the middle class. We will connect changes in print culture to early photography, film, and radio, thinking about how this history created the conditions of possibility for \"new media.\" In this class, we search for continuities that will help us frame current debates and scholarship on new media and its implications. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HISTORY OF 'OLD MEDIA'", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25845/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "HISTORY OF 'OLD MEDIA'", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-418-301", "path": "/courses/25845/sections/301", "id": "25845-301", "aliases": ["COMM-418-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/25845/sections/301/reviews/4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "first_name": "SHARRONA HYLA", "last_name": "PEARL", "id": "4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "name": "SHARRONA HYLA PEARL"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "25845-301-4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-418", "path": "/courses/25845", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25845/sections", "values": [{"name": "HISTORY OF 'OLD MEDIA'", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-418-301", "path": "/courses/25845/sections/301", "id": "25845-301", "aliases": ["COMM-418-301"]}]}, "id": 25845, "aliases": ["COMM-418"]}
