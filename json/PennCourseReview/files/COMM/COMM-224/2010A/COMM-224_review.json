To that end, during the first part of the course we will explore the idea of childhood including infancy, middle childhood, and the invention of adolescence; changing notions of child-rearing (e.g., \u201cexperts\u201d, discipline, place in society); schooling; vulnerable children; the child and the state; and the child\u2019s world (e.g., relationships with parents and peers; consumer culture; media; play). During the second part of the course, we will explore play in more detail including the culture of play; theories of play; artifacts used in play; and ways to study play. Course activities include lectures and group discussions; reading book chapters and empirical journal articles; examining children\u2019s artwork and writing samples; observing children at play; exploring children\u2019s artifacts (e.g., video games, board games, toys, videos, TV shows, books); and examining representations of childhood in popular culture. There will be several small writing projects (i.e., 3-5 pages); a mid-term and final (i.e., multiple choice, short-answer, and essay questions); and a final project designed in consultation with the instructor and/or TA.\r\nA number of students felt that the course was not accurately represented by the title and that it should be listed in the Psychology department rather than the Communications department. That said, many described the material as \u201cinteresting and fun.\u201d\r\nReviews of Professor Linenbarger\u2019s style were mixed. Some students really enjoyed being able to have such a great deal of discussion and sharing of personal experience despite the 90-person class size. Most found this to be frustrating, however, with students complaining that all the discussion was \u201cnot really necessary, particularly since there were many times when the professor could not finish the lecture.\u201d Furthermore, students agreed that Professor Linenbarger\u2019s tardiness led to an overall decrease in class productivity. Nevertheless, they conceded that Professor Linenbarger \u201cknows how to engage a class and encourage participation.\u201d\r\nStudents found the workload to be manageable but noted that since so much class time is devoted to discussion, exams tend to test material that was only covered in the reading. Students found that the papers were \u201cnot very taxing\u201d and somewhat unique.
