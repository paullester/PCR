{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4013"}, "description": "This course is designed to explore the history and construction of childhood and investigate the importance of play. To that end, during the first part of the course we will explore the idea of childhood including infancy, middle childhood, and the invention of adolescence; changing notions of child-rearing (e.g., \"experts\", discipline, place in society); schooling; vulnerable children; the child and the state; and the child's world (e.g. relationships with parents and peers; consumer culture; media; play). During the second part of the course, we will explore play in more detail including the culture of play; theories of play; artifacts used in play; and ways to study play. Course activities include lectures and group discussions; reading book chapters and empirical journal articles; examining chidren's artwork and writing samples; observing children at play; exploring children's artifacts (e.g., video games, board games, toys, videos, TV shows, books); and examining representations fo childhood in popular culture. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "Communication, Childhood, and Play", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14272/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.66", "rDifficulty": "1.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.03", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.34", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "Communication, Childhood, and Play", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-224-301", "path": "/courses/14272/sections/301", "id": "14272-301", "aliases": ["COMM-224-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/14272/sections/301/reviews/1814-DEBORAH-L--LINEBARGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1814-DEBORAH-L--LINEBARGER", "first_name": "DEBORAH L.", "last_name": "LINEBARGER", "id": "1814-DEBORAH-L--LINEBARGER", "name": "DEBORAH L.
