{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3620"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the history, modes, and aesthetics of documentary film and video, with an emphasis on US-produced works. The first half of the class traces the development of non-narrative film forms from the late 1900s to the early 2000s through two frames: the relationship between film/video, historical events, and social change; and the technological, political, and critical contexts that gave rise to different aesthetic modes in documentary works. The second half of the semester concentrates on topical issues: historical films, womens and gay \"liberation\" films, black filmmaking traditions, and autobiographical and family films. Each week we will view clips from classic examples of the period/mode/topic, plus one feature-length screening of a recent exemplar. By comparing the historical with the contemporary examples, students can see the legacy of past modes and styles in films made within the last 10 years. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "HIST OF THE DOCUMENTARY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10214/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "3.05", "rStimulateInterest": "2.52", "rRecommendMajor": "2.62", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "2.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.24", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.81", "rCommAbility": "2.81", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "HIST OF THE DOCUMENTARY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-316-301", "path": "/courses/10214/sections/301", "id": "10214-301", "aliases": ["COMM-316-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/10214/sections/301/reviews/1334-KATHERINE-E--SENDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1334-KATHERINE-E--SENDER", "first_name": "KATHERINE E.", "last_name": "SENDER", "id": "1334-KATHERINE-E--SENDER", "name": "KATHERINE E.
