{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3863"}, "description": "Is journalism the same all over the world? Do press systems and practices differ in fundamental ways that affect how we evaluate them politically, morally, aesthetically, epistemologically and economically? Where does U.S. journalism fit among the models? This new undergraduate seminar will introduce students to concrete differences in journalism around the world, but it won't only be an empirical look at how various press systems operate. We will also examine and argue about which journalistic practices and systems work best for which purposes, and explore the distinctive journalistic and philosophical assumptions and histories that undergird diverse practices and systems. Asian, European, African and Mideast journalism will all be attended to. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "Transnational Communication and Global Media", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13081/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.06", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.28", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.06", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "2.11", "rInstructorQuality": "2.39"}, "section": {"name": "Transnational Communication and Global Media", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-490-301", "path": "/courses/13081/sections/301", "id": "13081-301", "aliases": ["COMM-490-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/13081/sections/301/reviews/3926-CATHERINE-N--COYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3926-CATHERINE-N--COYER", "first_name": "CATHERINE N.", "last_name": "COYER", "id": "3926-CATHERINE-N--COYER", "name": "CATHERINE N.
