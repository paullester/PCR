{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5200"}, "description": "This course takes a philosophical, historical, and practical approach to understanding why and how the US media industries are regulated. It begins by examining the philosophical tension regarding free speech rights vs. child protection obligations and the media effects beliefs that would drive media regulation. Next, it examines the process of media policy formation and implementation, including the role of regulatory agencies, industry lobbyists, academic researchers and child advocates in advancing distinct policy agendas. Throughout the course we survey a range of policy actions, from legislatively required parental monitoring tools (such as the V-Chip) to voluntary industry efforts (such as network restriction of junk food advertising). We consider evidence of the success of these efforts in limiting children's exposure to damaging content and in improving parents' ability to supervise their children's media use. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CHILDREN'S MEDIA POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24222/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.77"}, "section": {"name": "CHILDREN'S MEDIA POLICY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-341-301", "path": "/courses/24222/sections/301", "id": "24222-301", "aliases": ["COMM-341-301"]}, "comments": "*Communications 341 takes a philosophical, historical, and practical approach to understanding why and how the US media industries are regulated.
