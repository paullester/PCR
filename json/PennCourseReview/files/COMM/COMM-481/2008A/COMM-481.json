{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3332"}, "description": "Social network analysis is the study of the patterns of social relations. It has applications in the study of friendship, social support, Internet use, organizational behavior, mental and physical health, and the diffusion of information. This upper level seminar is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of social structure, including: network size, diversity, frequency of contact, tie duration, and tie strength. The course focuses on how network structure is related to everyday life, such as health, access to social support, and job attainment. Particular attention is given to the role of communication media in facilitating interpersonal connectivity (face-to-face, over the telephone, and over the Internet), and the role of information and communication technologies (i.e. the Internet) in social support. Students participate through in-depth seminars and independendant projects. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "SOCIAL NETWORKS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19980/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "3.24", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.88", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.76"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIAL NETWORKS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-481-301", "path": "/courses/19980/sections/301", "id": "19980-301", "aliases": ["COMM-481-301", "SOCI-481-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/19980/sections/301/reviews/3252-KEITH-N--HAMPTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3252-KEITH-N--HAMPTON", "first_name": "KEITH N.", "last_name": "HAMPTON", "id": "3252-KEITH-N--HAMPTON", "name": "KEITH N.
