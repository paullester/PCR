{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4477"}, "description": "Contentious battles among media owners, content creators, advertisers, and advocates play an important role in influencing the structure and content of contemporary communications -- broadcasting, cable T.V., and now broadband. These struggles take place across a spectrum of sites in Washington, from the halls and hearing rooms of Congress, to regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission to the plush offices of K Street lobbying firms. Through a series of case studies and guest speakers, we will examine a variety of policy and programming issues,as well as political, economic, and social forces, that are having a major impact on the media landscape. Topics to be covered will include: minority and female media ownership, public interest content and news programming, broadband access, interactive advertising, public media, newspaper ownership, and digital music distribution. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "Communications, Policy , Advocacy, and Media Market Structure", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16655/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "1.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "Communications, Policy , Advocacy, and Media Market Structure", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "COMM-305-920", "path": "/courses/16655/sections/920", "id": "16655-920", "aliases": ["COMM-305-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/16655/sections/920/reviews/4635-DANIEL-BERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4635-DANIEL-BERGER", "first_name": "DANIEL", "last_name": "BERGER", "id": "4635-DANIEL-BERGER", "name": "DANIEL BERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "16655-920-4635-DANIEL-BERGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-305", "path": "/courses/16655", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16655/sections", "values": [{"name": "Communications, Policy , Advocacy, and Media Market Structure", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "COMM-305-920", "path": "/courses/16655/sections/920", "id": "16655-920", "aliases": ["COMM-305-920"]}]}, "id": 16655, "aliases": ["COMM-305"]}
