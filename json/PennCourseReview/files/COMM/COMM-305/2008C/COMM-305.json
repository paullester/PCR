{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4477"}, "description": "Contentious battles among media owners, content creators, advertisers, and advocates play an important role in influencing the structure and content of contemporary communications -- broadcasting, cable T.V., and now broadband. These struggles take place across a spectrum of sites in Washington, from the halls and hearing rooms of Congress, to regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission to the plush offices of K Street lobbying firms. Through a series of case studies and guest speakers, we will examine a variety of policy and programming issues,as well as political, economic, and social forces, that are having a major impact on the media landscape. Topics to be covered will include: minority and female media ownership, public interest content and news programming, broadband access, interactive advertising, public media, newspaper ownership, and digital music distribution. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "COMM POL, ADV, & MEDIA: COMMUNICATIONS POLICY, ADVOCACY, AND MEDIA MARKET STRUCTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18483/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.08", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "COMM POL, ADV, & MEDIA: COMMUNICATIONS POLICY, ADVOCACY, AND MEDIA MARKET STRUCTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-305-301", "path": "/courses/18483/sections/301", "id": "18483-301", "aliases": ["COMM-305-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/18483/sections/301/reviews/5032-JEFFREY-A--CHESTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5032-JEFFREY-A--CHESTER", "first_name": "JEFFREY A.", "last_name": "CHESTER", "id": "5032-JEFFREY-A--CHESTER", "name": "JEFFREY A.
