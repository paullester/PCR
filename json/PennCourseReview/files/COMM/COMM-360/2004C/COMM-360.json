{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/303"}, "description": "This course explores uses of language, conversation, and discourse in diverse situations. It introduces several language-based concepts and critically examines with them a variety of social phenomena whose existence we tend to take for granted, human communication included. The course invokes a paradigm shift from conceptualizing language as a system of representations and control to regarding language as a joint effort of (re)constructing the very realities we inhabit, observe, and actively maintain. Students research a topic on their own. Readings, lectures, seminar-type discussions, and individual student's contributions are intended to facilitate the use of a vocabulary that enables the conduct of social research and everyday life. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL: Language in the Social Construction of Realities", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5137/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.93", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL: Language in the Social Construction of Realities", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-360-301", "path": "/courses/5137/sections/301", "id": "5137-301", "aliases": ["COMM-360-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/5137/sections/301/reviews/290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF", "first_name": "KLAUS", "last_name": "KRIPPENDORFF", "id": "290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF", "name": "KLAUS KRIPPENDORFF"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "5137-301-290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-360", "path": "/courses/5137", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5137/sections", "values": [{"name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL: Language in the Social Construction of Realities", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-360-301", "path": "/courses/5137/sections/301", "id": "5137-301", "aliases": ["COMM-360-301"]}]}, "id": 5137, "aliases": ["COMM-360"]}
