{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/303"}, "description": "This course explores uses of language, conversation, and discourse in diverse situations. It introduces several language-based concepts and critically examines with them a variety of social phenomena whose existence we tend to take for granted, human communication included. The course invokes a paradigm shift from conceptualizing language as a system of representations and control to regarding language as a joint effort of (re)constructing the very realities we inhabit, observe, and actively maintain. Students research a topic on their own. Readings, lectures, seminar-type discussions, and individual student's contributions are intended to facilitate the use of a vocabulary that enables the conduct of social research and everyday life. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3940/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-360-301", "path": "/courses/3940/sections/301", "id": "3940-301", "aliases": ["COMM-360-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/3940/sections/301/reviews/290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF", "first_name": "KLAUS", "last_name": "KRIPPENDORFF", "id": "290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF", "name": "KLAUS KRIPPENDORFF"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "3940-301-290-KLAUS-KRIPPENDORFF"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-360", "path": "/courses/3940", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3940/sections", "values": [{"name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-360-301", "path": "/courses/3940/sections/301", "id": "3940-301", "aliases": ["COMM-360-301"]}]}, "id": 3940, "aliases": ["COMM-360"]}
