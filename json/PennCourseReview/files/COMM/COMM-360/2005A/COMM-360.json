{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/303"}, "description": "This course explores uses of language, conversation, and discourse in diverse situations. It introduces several language-based concepts and critically examines with them a variety of social phenomena whose existence we tend to take for granted, human communication included. The course invokes a paradigm shift from conceptualizing language as a system of representations and control to regarding language as a joint effort of (re)constructing the very realities we inhabit, observe, and actively maintain. Students research a topic on their own. Readings, lectures, seminar-type discussions, and individual student's contributions are intended to facilitate the use of a vocabulary that enables the conduct of social research and everyday life. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10220/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "3.55", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.55", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "COMM-360-601", "path": "/courses/10220/sections/601", "id": "10220-601", "aliases": ["COMM-360-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/10220/sections/601/reviews/2429-ROSA-GROSS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2429-ROSA-GROSS", "first_name": "ROSA", "last_name": "GROSS", "id": "2429-ROSA-GROSS", "name": "ROSA GROSS"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "10220-601-2429-ROSA-GROSS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-360", "path": "/courses/10220", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10220/sections", "values": [{"name": "LANG SOC CONSTRUCT REAL", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "COMM-360-601", "path": "/courses/10220/sections/601", "id": "10220-601", "aliases": ["COMM-360-601"]}]}, "id": 10220, "aliases": ["COMM-360"]}
