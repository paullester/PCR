{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4927"}, "description": "This course will examine trends in international and transnational communications. In an era of satellites and the Internet, traditional ways of thinking about the relationship of the state to the circulation of images and ideas are altering in important ways. In the course we look at questions of state sovereignty, the rise of new information powers and shifting modes of thinking about media and power. The course will deal with media in conflict zones, public diplomacy, international broadcasting, competing ideas of structuring the Internet, and changes and pressures on international norms of free expression. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "International Communication", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21509/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.63", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "International Communication", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-464-301", "path": "/courses/21509/sections/301", "id": "21509-301", "aliases": ["COMM-464-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/21509/sections/301/reviews/5328-MONROE-E-PRICE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5328-MONROE-E-PRICE", "first_name": "MONROE E", "last_name": "PRICE", "id": "5328-MONROE-E-PRICE", "name": "MONROE E PRICE"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "21509-301-5328-MONROE-E-PRICE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-464", "path": "/courses/21509", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21509/sections", "values": [{"name": "International Communication", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-464-301", "path": "/courses/21509/sections/301", "id": "21509-301", "aliases": ["COMM-464-301"]}]}, "id": 21509, "aliases": ["COMM-464"]}
