{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1762"}, "description": "This course aims to provide students with a critical understanding of journalism. It combines theoretical perspectives on the making of news with primary source material produced by and about journalists. Students will analyze theoretical material on journalism -- about how news is made, shaped, and performed -- alongside articles and broadcasts appearing in the media, interviews with journalists in the trade press, and professional reviews. Topics include models of journalistic practice, journalistic values and norms, gatekeeping and sourcing practices, storytelling formats in news, and ethical problems related to misrepresentation, plagiarism, and celebrity. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "CRIT PERSPECT IN JOURNAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9696/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "CRIT PERSPECT IN JOURNAL", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "COMM-339-910", "path": "/courses/9696/sections/910", "id": "9696-910", "aliases": ["COMM-339-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/9696/sections/910/reviews/3537-MATTHEW-A--CARLSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3537-MATTHEW-A--CARLSON", "first_name": "MATTHEW A.", "last_name": "CARLSON", "id": "3537-MATTHEW-A--CARLSON", "name": "MATTHEW A.
