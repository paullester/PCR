{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4543"}, "description": "New technologies can be \"technologies of freedom\"or they may be technologies of or they may be technologies of control. Throughout history, different social actors (e.g. politicians, social movements corporations, etc) have sought to leverage the new information technology of the moment in service of different outcomes. Governments have tried to control the Internet and/or mobile phone usage in order to win re-election. Activists have used text messaging to organize social movements and/or bypass state censorship. Bloggers and citizen journalists now use Twitter and other social media applications to make their stories heard around the world. Each new generation of technology may challenge and/or reinforce existing power structures. This course will examine the evolution of communication technologies, their physical characteristics, and their impact on politics, society and culture in the context of theories of communication and power. We will also explore a series of case studies that explore how and why states, citizens, and the media utilize new technologies. Topics will include: the Internet crack down in Burma, internet rumors in the US presidential campaign, the use of social media technology (Ushahidi) by Kenyan activists to document election violence in 2008. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "NEW TECH, COMM & CONTROL: New Technology, Communication, and Control", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17168/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.87", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06"}, "section": {"name": "NEW TECH, COMM & CONTROL: New Technology, Communication, and Control", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-303-301", "path": "/courses/17168/sections/301", "id": "17168-301", "aliases": ["COMM-303-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/17168/sections/301/reviews/4769-AMELIA-H-ARSENAULT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4769-AMELIA-H-ARSENAULT", "first_name": "AMELIA H", "last_name": "ARSENAULT", "id": "4769-AMELIA-H-ARSENAULT", "name": "AMELIA H ARSENAULT"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "17168-301-4769-AMELIA-H-ARSENAULT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-303", "path": "/courses/17168", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17168/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEW TECH, COMM & CONTROL: New Technology, Communication, and Control", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-303-301", "path": "/courses/17168/sections/301", "id": "17168-301", "aliases": ["COMM-303-301"]}]}, "id": 17168, "aliases": ["COMM-303"]}
