{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1764"}, "description": "Criticism has at its core an assumption of judgment about the target or performance being evaluated. Yet whose judgment is being articulated? On which basis and authority? To which ends? And with which effects? This course examines the shape of contemporary media criticism, focusing on its meaning function in different domains of popular culture (including music, television, news, and film) and the patterns by which it is produced. Students will become acquainted with theories and ongoing debates about contemporary media criticism themselves. The course aims to sensitize students to the nuances of their own consumption of criticism and patterns by which it is typically produced. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "MEDIA CRITICISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2787/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.77", "rDifficulty": "2.61", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.78", "rCommAbility": "2.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "MEDIA CRITICISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-439-301", "path": "/courses/2787/sections/301", "id": "2787-301", "aliases": ["COMM-439-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/2787/sections/301/reviews/1343-BARBIE-ZELIZER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1343-BARBIE-ZELIZER", "first_name": "BARBIE", "last_name": "ZELIZER", "id": "1343-BARBIE-ZELIZER", "name": "BARBIE ZELIZER"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "2787-301-1343-BARBIE-ZELIZER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-439", "path": "/courses/2787", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2787/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDIA CRITICISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-439-301", "path": "/courses/2787/sections/301", "id": "2787-301", "aliases": ["COMM-439-301"]}]}, "id": 2787, "aliases": ["COMM-439"]}
