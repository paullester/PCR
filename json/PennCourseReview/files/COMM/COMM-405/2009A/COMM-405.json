{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4213"}, "description": "Is race imaginary? If so, who invented facial distinctions and why can we see them? Do pictures change the way we think? How do artists think about the people they draw and satirize? This course will explore the relationship between caricature and perceptions of racial difference in modern western culture. We will interrogate the role that visual images play in framing our perceptions of groups and their defining characteristics. Broadly historical, this interdisciplinary course will introduce students to scholarship in visual culture, media studies, science studies, and race theory. Students will develop skills in primary source analysis, historical methodology, and visual analysis. Assignments will include a visual analysis, 4 short papers, and a final exam. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "FACING RACE: RACE AND CARICATURE IN THE HISTORICAL IMAGINATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15550/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.55", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "FACING RACE: RACE AND CARICATURE IN THE HISTORICAL IMAGINATION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-405-301", "path": "/courses/15550/sections/301", "id": "15550-301", "aliases": ["COMM-405-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/15550/sections/301/reviews/4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "first_name": "SHARRONA HYLA", "last_name": "PEARL", "id": "4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL", "name": "SHARRONA HYLA PEARL"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "15550-301-4291-SHARRONA-HYLA-PEARL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-405", "path": "/courses/15550", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15550/sections", "values": [{"name": "FACING RACE: RACE AND CARICATURE IN THE HISTORICAL IMAGINATION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-405-301", "path": "/courses/15550/sections/301", "id": "15550-301", "aliases": ["COMM-405-301"]}]}, "id": 15550, "aliases": ["COMM-405"]}
