{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4863"}, "description": "This course is designed to enhance students' understanding of the role the media plays influencing the course of public policy in the nation's capital. It will provide students with opportunities to assess major issues, currently in the news, from multiple perspectives (those of Congress, the President, interest groups, the old and new media, lobbyists, political consultants and others). They will explore the emergence of multiple \"narratives\" the media uses to frame policy debates,how these are formed, and how they change over time. Readings and class discussions will be supplemented by appearances by guests who have had participated in important ongoing and past policy debates.\" \n\n", "semester": "2010B", "name": "WASH POL AND THE MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20999/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.67", "rDifficulty": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.25", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "1.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.17", "rCommAbility": "1.92", "rInstructorQuality": "1.92"}, "section": {"name": "WASH POL AND THE MEDIA", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "COMM-309-900", "path": "/courses/20999/sections/900", "id": "20999-900", "aliases": ["COMM-309-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/20999/sections/900/reviews/3924-ALVIN-S--FELZENBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3924-ALVIN-S--FELZENBERG", "first_name": "ALVIN S.", "last_name": "FELZENBERG", "id": "3924-ALVIN-S--FELZENBERG", "name": "ALVIN S.
