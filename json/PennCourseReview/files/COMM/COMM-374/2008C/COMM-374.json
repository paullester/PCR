{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3861"}, "description": "This course will examine how Congress goes about the business of translating the public's concerns into legislation and keeps the public informed of its progress. It will examine how the two chambers interact in this process, what role the media plays in shaping Congress's agenda and vice versa, and what impact the advent of 24 hour news, C-SPAN and the internet have had on Congressional deliberations. A historical approach will be taken in considering the evolution of both chambers and the media's coverage of them. Students will examine differences between the House and Senate in both their institutional development and how they go about communicating with each other, the general public, and the other branches and levels of government. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "COMMUNICATION & CONGRESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18485/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "2.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.37", "rWorkRequired": "2.68", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.68", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "COMMUNICATION & CONGRESS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-374-401", "path": "/courses/18485/sections/401", "id": "18485-401", "aliases": ["COMM-374-401", "PSCI-374-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/18485/sections/401/reviews/3924-ALVIN-S--FELZENBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3924-ALVIN-S--FELZENBERG", "first_name": "ALVIN S.", "last_name": "FELZENBERG", "id": "3924-ALVIN-S--FELZENBERG", "name": "ALVIN S.
