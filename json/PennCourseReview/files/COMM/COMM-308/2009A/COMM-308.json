{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3327"}, "description": "This course is designed to explore the unique issues that arise for communications researchers who work with children. We begin by considering the role of theory in designing research by providing examples of theoretical paradigms that shape research programs (e.g., developmental theory, critical theory, ecological theory). We next review the major methodological approaches communications researchers in this field use, including lab and field experiments, surveys and interviews, naturalistic and ethnographic research and secondary data analysis. We examine the variety of contexts in which such research is employed (e.g., audience research, market research, and social research) and consider the unique ethical issues and protective mechanisms in place. The course culminates in group-based, supervised research wherein students have an opportunity to design and implement a child-focused study. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "COMM RES W/CHILD & FAM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15541/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.39", "rDifficulty": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.39", "rRecommendMajor": "2.74", "rCourseQuality": "2.58", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "2.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.35", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "COMM RES W/CHILD & FAM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-308-301", "path": "/courses/15541/sections/301", "id": "15541-301", "aliases": ["COMM-308-301"]}, "comments": "This course is designed to explore the unique issues that arise for communications researchers who work with children.
