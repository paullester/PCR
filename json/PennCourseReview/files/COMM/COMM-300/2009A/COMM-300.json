It is the intersection of the individual life and the communal life, where societies express their character. Public space is the physical medium that we all share. It is a rich environment that gives relevance to our common understanding and to our memory of what takes place and what we say to each other - a physical reference for the action of life. This course will survey and discuss the scope of public space, with the objective of finding its definition\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that the course was interesting and liked that it offered something different from the other communications courses. One student called it \u201can introduction to a new way of thinking\u201d and another liked that it \u201ccrossed into many areas of study like art history and psychology\u201d and \u201cchallenged you to think outside the box.\u201d While most people saw the slightly different perspective as a benefit, some thought that it focused too much on urban studies instead of communication.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kelley was considered by some to be \"opinionated\" and spent too much of the lecture time talking rather than having class discussions. Other however felt he \"kept the class interesting\" and was very intelligent and thoughtful with \u201can excellent attitude and good goals for the class.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the amount of work was overwhelming at times and the journal was hard to keep up with. You need to watch movies, go downtown, do papers and keep a journal for the course.", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/15539/sections/001/reviews/2900-DANIEL-KELLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2900-DANIEL-KELLEY", "first_name": "DANIEL", "last_name": "KELLEY", "id": "2900-DANIEL-KELLEY", "name": "DANIEL KELLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "15539-001-2900-DANIEL-KELLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-300", "path": "/courses/15539", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15539/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC SPACE,PUBLIC LIFE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-300-001", "path": "/courses/15539/sections/001", "id": "15539-001", "aliases": ["COMM-300-001"]}]}, "id": 15539, "aliases": ["COMM-300"]}
