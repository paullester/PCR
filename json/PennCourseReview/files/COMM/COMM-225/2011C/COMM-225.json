{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/295"}, "description": "This course examines children's relationship to media in its historic, economic, political and social contexts. The class begins with an exploration of the ways in which \"childhood\" is created and understood as a time of life that is qualitatively unique and socially constructed over time. It continues with a review of various theories of child development as they inform children's relationship with and understanding of television and other household media. It next reviews public policies designed to empower parents and limit children's exposure to potentially problematic media content and simultaneously considers the economic forces that shape what children see and buy. Children and Media concludes with a critical examination of research on the impact of media on children's physical, cognitive, social and psychological development. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CHILDREN & MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24219/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.48", "rStimulateInterest": "3.45", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.23", "rWorkRequired": "2.66", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.78", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "CHILDREN & MEDIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-225-001", "path": "/courses/24219/sections/001", "id": "24219-001", "aliases": ["COMM-225-001"]}, "comments": "Communications 225 focuses on children's relationship to media throughout history.  The class has four aims. First, it explores how the notion of childhood was formed. Second, it examines different explanations of child development and the role of media. Third, it studies economic forces and public policies. Finally, it explores research concerning the effects of media on children. \r\n\r\nOverall, students found this course very engaging. The amount of work, however, discouraged some. Some students felt that the final exam and term paper were scheduled too close together.  Others thought the term paper was overly long. Overall though, students enjoyed the material.\r\n\r\nStudents heap praises on Professor Jordan. One student described her as \u201cfriendly and accessible,\u201d while another said her lectures were \u201cfun, relevant, and engaging.\u201d There were no negative comments about Professor Jordan.\r\n\r\nThis class caters towards Communications majors and minors. Students described the course as \u201cfun,\u201d but \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201ctime-consuming.\u201d Generally, students considered the weekly homework light, but the big assignments significant. There is a comprehensive final, as well as a term paper.\r\n", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/24219/sections/001/reviews/281-AMY-B--JORDAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/281-AMY-B--JORDAN", "first_name": "AMY B.", "last_name": "JORDAN", "id": "281-AMY-B--JORDAN", "name": "AMY B.
