{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/295"}, "description": "This course examines children's relationship to media in its historic, economic, political and social contexts. The class begins with an exploration of the ways in which \"childhood\" is created and understood as a time of life that is qualitatively unique and socially constructed over time. It continues with a review of various theories of child development as they inform children's relationship with and understanding of television and other household media. It next reviews public policies designed to empower parents and limit children's exposure to potentially problematic media content and simultaneously considers the economic forces that shape what children see and buy. Children and Media concludes with a critical examination of research on the impact of media on children's physical, cognitive, social and psychological development. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "CHILDREN & MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10210/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "CHILDREN & MEDIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COMM-225-001", "path": "/courses/10210/sections/001", "id": "10210-001", "aliases": ["COMM-225-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/10210/sections/001/reviews/281-AMY-B--JORDAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/281-AMY-B--JORDAN", "first_name": "AMY B.", "last_name": "JORDAN", "id": "281-AMY-B--JORDAN", "name": "AMY B.
