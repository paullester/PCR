{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5404"}, "description": "This course explores the role of communication in theories of political change and democratic development. It addresses the questions: What are the major hypotheses about the relationship between communication and regime type? How have our hypotheses about communication evolved over time in response to changes in prominent development theories, policy trends, technical developments, and empirical evidence? What kinds of media threaten or enhance authoritarian control? How might the communication strategies of activists facilitate revolution and democratization? How have the media and citizen engagement been employed to enhance good governance? To what extent are democracy and media assistance programs supported by theory and empirical evidence? The course is designed to provide a greater understanding of the relationship between communication and democratization, as well as to develop social science reasoning and methodology. The readings, class discussions, and assignments focus on developing countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "COMM & DEMOCRATIZATION:  Communication and Democratization", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27218/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.69", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "COMM & DEMOCRATIZATION:  Communication and Democratization", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-433-401", "path": "/courses/27218/sections/401", "id": "27218-401", "aliases": ["COMM-433-401", "PSCI-415-401"]}, "comments": "This course explores the role of communication in theories of political change and democratic development.

One student mentioned that she \u201cwas good one on one, especially in office hours.\u201d However, some students stated that \u201cin class she wasn\u2019t very engaging,\u201d and \u201cneeds to do a better job of facilitating discussion,\u201d because they could often go off-topic, which would waste valuable class time. One student also mentioned that she was very micromanaging on the research paper.\r\n\r\nThe course is composed of a lot of reading and a final research paper.
