{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2501"}, "description": "This upper level undergraduate research course examines the ways in which public policy alternatives are introduced into public discourse. Informed by an emerging literature within communication, sociology, and political science that examines the framing of social issues, students will select an issue of public concern of a contemporary or historical nature and will produce an analysis of policy frames and their sponsors. Students may, for example, choose to examine the ways in which the framing of environmental policy issues have changed over a specific period of time, or in response to critical events. Alternatively, students may choose to examine the ways in which public policies such as Affirmative Action have been framed in different regions of the country. Policy discourse can be examined in a wide variety of contexts including news and editorials, congressional testimony, and legislative debates as well as in presidential speeches. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "FRAMING PUBLIC POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11610/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "FRAMING PUBLIC POLICY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-454-301", "path": "/courses/11610/sections/301", "id": "11610-301", "aliases": ["COMM-454-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/11610/sections/301/reviews/288-OSCAR-HOWARD-GANDY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/288-OSCAR-HOWARD-GANDY", "first_name": "OSCAR HOWARD", "last_name": "GANDY", "id": "288-OSCAR-HOWARD-GANDY", "name": "OSCAR HOWARD GANDY"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "11610-301-288-OSCAR-HOWARD-GANDY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-454", "path": "/courses/11610", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11610/sections", "values": [{"name": "FRAMING PUBLIC POLICY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-454-301", "path": "/courses/11610/sections/301", "id": "11610-301", "aliases": ["COMM-454-301"]}]}, "id": 11610, "aliases": ["COMM-454"]}
