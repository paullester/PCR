{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5403"}, "description": "This course explores major themes in the study of political communication from a comparative perspective. It focuses on how communication affects political behavior, attitudes, and outcomes. In doing so we question the forces that shape media institutions and how different political and social institutions shape individual-level communication effects. The course is designed to provide a greater understanding of comparative political communication theories, as well as to develop social science reasoning and methodology. Readings, class discussions, and assignments move back and forth between theories, empirical evidence, and public policies. The readings include research from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and North America though Europe receives somewhat more attention due to the richness of comparative data and research for that region. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "COMPARATIVE POL COMM: Comparative Political Communication", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30112/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.83", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "COMPARATIVE POL COMM: Comparative Political Communication", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-403-401", "path": "/courses/30112/sections/401", "id": "30112-401", "aliases": ["COMM-403-401", "PSCI-410-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/30112/sections/401/reviews/5325-DEVRA-C--MOEHLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5325-DEVRA-C--MOEHLER", "first_name": "DEVRA C.", "last_name": "MOEHLER", "id": "5325-DEVRA-C--MOEHLER", "name": "DEVRA C.
