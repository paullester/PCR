{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5401"}, "description": "The way outgroups (e.g, African Americans, gays and lesbians, women, etc.) are portrayed in the media is widely assumed to have consequences for levels of prejudice and stereotyping in the mass public. The visual nature of television and its heavy viewership make it a particularly important source of information for impressions that ingroup members may have of other social groups. This class will evaluate: 1) analytical frameworks used to examine media content about outgroups, 2) theoretical frameworks that may be useful for understanding how media exposure influences outgroup attitudes, and 3) prior empirical evidence attesting to the causal impact of media exposure on outgroup attitudes. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "The Effects of Mass Media on Stereotyping and Prejudice", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27206/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "2.26", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.61", "rWorkRequired": "2.37", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.22", "rCommAbility": "2.72", "rInstructorQuality": "2.65"}, "section": {"name": "The Effects of Mass Media on Stereotyping and Prejudice", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-278-301", "path": "/courses/27206/sections/301", "id": "27206-301", "aliases": ["COMM-278-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/27206/sections/301/reviews/6077-SETH-K--GOLDMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6077-SETH-K--GOLDMAN", "first_name": "SETH K.", "last_name": "GOLDMAN", "id": "6077-SETH-K--GOLDMAN", "name": "SETH K.
