{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3331"}, "description": "This course provides an overview of recent research on the social implications of new media. The focus is on how recent technological innovations such as the Internet and mobile phones may be changing the way we interact with our environments and those around us. This seminar takes students beyond basic questions of \"are virtual communities real communities?\" and \"does the Internet damage community?\" to an in-depth discussion of how networks of community relations are maintained and transformed on and offline as a result of new media. The course is based around the argument that computer networks are inherently social networks, linking people, organizations and communities. This subject is weighted towards the evaluation of empirical studies, the use of social network analysis, and studies that address sociological research questions. Students will learn to critically examine the impact of new media on society through seminars and independent research. \n\n", "semester": "2011B", "name": "New Media and Community Life", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25306/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "New Media and Community Life", "sectionnum": "935", "primary_alias": "COMM-410-935", "path": "/courses/25306/sections/935", "id": "25306-935", "aliases": ["COMM-410-935"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/25306/sections/935/reviews/5929-LAUREN-SESSIONS-GOULET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5929-LAUREN-SESSIONS-GOULET", "first_name": "LAUREN", "last_name": "SESSIONS GOULET", "id": "5929-LAUREN-SESSIONS-GOULET", "name": "LAUREN SESSIONS GOULET"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "25306-935-5929-LAUREN-SESSIONS-GOULET"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-410", "path": "/courses/25306", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25306/sections", "values": [{"name": "New Media and Community Life", "sectionnum": "935", "primary_alias": "COMM-410-935", "path": "/courses/25306/sections/935", "id": "25306-935", "aliases": ["COMM-410-935"]}]}, "id": 25306, "aliases": ["COMM-410"]}
