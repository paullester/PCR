{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5642"}, "description": "This discussion-oriented course examines key digital media policy debates and their underlying politics. We will examine policies affecting news and entertainment media, social media, telecommunications, and the Internet. Drawing from major texts within this growing sub-field, we will formulate analyses about the future trajectory of U.S. and global digital media and evaluate relevant policies in relation to democratic theory and ethical concerns. In particular, we will focus on how media policy is shaped by political processes in and outside Washington, D.C., and consider to what extent new digital media have disrupted pre-existing policy regimes. Students will choose one specific case study of a digital media policy debate to explore throughout the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "The Politics of Digital Media Policy", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30115/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "1.94", "rTAQuality": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.28", "rCourseQuality": "3.16", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.16"}, "section": {"name": "The Politics of Digital Media Policy", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-417-301", "path": "/courses/30115/sections/301", "id": "30115-301", "aliases": ["COMM-417-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/30115/sections/301/reviews/6473-VICTOR-PICKARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6473-VICTOR-PICKARD", "first_name": "VICTOR", "last_name": "PICKARD", "id": "6473-VICTOR-PICKARD", "name": "VICTOR PICKARD"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30115-301-6473-VICTOR-PICKARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-417", "path": "/courses/30115", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30115/sections", "values": [{"name": "The Politics of Digital Media Policy", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-417-301", "path": "/courses/30115/sections/301", "id": "30115-301", "aliases": ["COMM-417-301"]}]}, "id": 30115, "aliases": ["COMM-417"]}
