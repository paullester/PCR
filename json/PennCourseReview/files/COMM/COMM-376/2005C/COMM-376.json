{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3330"}, "description": "This course will take a detailed look at rhetorical practices of the United States Supreme Court. Students learn how cases come before the High Court, constraints on judicial decision making, and how the Court is selected. By following a current Supreme Court case, we will examine petitions for certiorari, main and amicus briefs, oral arguments and judicial decisions and learn persuasion and argumentation skills. Students will write an amicus brief, prepare and deliver an oral argument and both argue and decide the case in a moot court proceeding. For the final exam, students will write the opinion in the case as if a sitting Justice. The class will travel either to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to hear an oral argument and will attend at least one taping of NPR's Justice Talking at the National Constitution Center. Class attendance is mandatory. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "SUPREME COURT ADVOCACY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11608/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.65", "rDifficulty": "3.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.35", "rCommAbility": "3.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "SUPREME COURT ADVOCACY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-376-301", "path": "/courses/11608/sections/301", "id": "11608-301", "aliases": ["COMM-376-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/11608/sections/301/reviews/280-KATHRYN-KOLBERT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/280-KATHRYN-KOLBERT", "first_name": "KATHRYN", "last_name": "KOLBERT", "id": "280-KATHRYN-KOLBERT", "name": "KATHRYN KOLBERT"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "11608-301-280-KATHRYN-KOLBERT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-376", "path": "/courses/11608", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11608/sections", "values": [{"name": "SUPREME COURT ADVOCACY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-376-301", "path": "/courses/11608/sections/301", "id": "11608-301", "aliases": ["COMM-376-301"]}]}, "id": 11608, "aliases": ["COMM-376"]}
