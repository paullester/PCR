{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5640"}, "description": "This seminar provides an introduction to the politics and tactics underlying various types of media activism. The class will examine interventions aimed at media representations, labor relations in media production, media policy reform, activists' strategic communications, and \"alternative\" media making. The course will draw from an overview of the existing scholarship on media activism, as well as close analyses of actual activist practices within both old and new media at local, national, and global levels. We will study how various political groups, past and present, use media to advance their interests and effect social change. Each member of the class will choose one case study of an activist group or campaign to explore throughout the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MEDIA ACTIVISM STUDIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30099/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "1.13", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "1.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "MEDIA ACTIVISM STUDIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-112-301", "path": "/courses/30099/sections/301", "id": "30099-301", "aliases": ["COMM-112-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/30099/sections/301/reviews/6473-VICTOR-PICKARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6473-VICTOR-PICKARD", "first_name": "VICTOR", "last_name": "PICKARD", "id": "6473-VICTOR-PICKARD", "name": "VICTOR PICKARD"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "30099-301-6473-VICTOR-PICKARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-112", "path": "/courses/30099", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30099/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDIA ACTIVISM STUDIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-112-301", "path": "/courses/30099/sections/301", "id": "30099-301", "aliases": ["COMM-112-301"]}]}, "id": 30099, "aliases": ["COMM-112"]}
