{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/493"}, "description": "\"Fieldwork\" is the term folklorists and scholars in related fields use to describe the process by which they arrive at their discipline's subject matter. This includes everything from the pragmatic issues of collecting and documenting materials to the complex relations involved whken people study people. Readings, short writing assignments, and class discussions will probe this spectrum of concerns comprehensively. Brief exercises are planned to experience different aspects of fieldwork. On this background of theory and practice, students will work toward designing a fieldwork based project and draft a funding proposal. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ISSUES FOLKLORE THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1662/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "ISSUES FOLKLORE THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FOLK-503-401", "path": "/courses/1662/sections/401", "id": "1662-401", "aliases": ["FOLK-503-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/1662/sections/401/reviews/1441-MARY-T--HUFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1441-MARY-T--HUFFORD", "first_name": "MARY T.", "last_name": "HUFFORD", "id": "1441-MARY-T--HUFFORD", "name": "MARY T.
