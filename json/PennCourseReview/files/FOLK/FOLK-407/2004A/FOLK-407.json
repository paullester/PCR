{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2823"}, "description": "The title of the course reflects its dual goals: on the one hand, we wish to explore how folklore and folklore research, especially in Europe, have been connected histortically to a territory language, and national belonging. Toward this end, we will examine various attemps to find in national wisdom evidence of ancient origin, glorious history, and cultural uniqueness. On the other hand, we want to understand the process of establishing a national folklore. We will examine various cultural expressions and/or inventions of the national \"us\" perspective. Specifically, we will explore the roles of notions such as 'tradition\" and authenticiy in elevating elements of an ethnic group's folklore to the favored status of national folklore. In this context, we will consider wha account for the endurance of some nationlistic representations as opposed to others in a world that is constantly changing. We will us the Balken Slavic countries (Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro,Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) as case studies, though students will be expected to bring their own ethnic/national background and experience to the class discussions. Reading will be from both conteemporary and historical sources, and will concern both practical problems and theoretical issues. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "NATL & FOLK WORLD CHANGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6568/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "NATL & FOLK WORLD CHANGE", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "FOLK-407-640", "path": "/courses/6568/sections/640", "id": "6568-640", "aliases": ["FOLK-407-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/6568/sections/640/reviews/2768-IVETA-TODOROVA-PIRGOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2768-IVETA-TODOROVA-PIRGOVA", "first_name": "IVETA", "last_name": "TODOROVA-PIRGOVA", "id": "2768-IVETA-TODOROVA-PIRGOVA", "name": "IVETA TODOROVA-PIRGOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "6568-640-2768-IVETA-TODOROVA-PIRGOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FOLK-407", "path": "/courses/6568", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6568/sections", "values": [{"name": "NATL & FOLK WORLD CHANGE", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "FOLK-407-640", "path": "/courses/6568/sections/640", "id": "6568-640", "aliases": ["FOLK-407-640"]}]}, "id": 6568, "aliases": ["FOLK-407"]}
