What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? How did practitioners of \u201cnon-Western\u201d medicine carve out places for themselves? How do today\u2019s medical problems grow out of this history? This is a fascinating history of race and gender, of pathogens and conquerors, of science and the body. It tells about the historical and regional roots of today\u2019s problems in international medicine.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nOverall, students gave Professor Feierman\u2019s course very positive feedback, appreciating especially the wealth of knowledge Professor Feierman provided. One student stated that the course \u201ctouched on a huge amount of issues.\u201d Another student called it \u201cone of my favorite courses I\u2019ve taken in 6 semesters at Penn.\u201d However, while students found the readings incredibly relevant and applicable, they also said that the workload could have probably been trimmed down.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nOnce again, students greatly appreciated the great deal of knowledge Professor Feierman presented to the class based upon his own experiences. Despite this, students also acknowledged that because of all of the information pertaining to the subject matter, sometimes lectures were too long for the course time allocated each session. Several students also made specific note to thank the TA\u2019s, who were \u201cincredibly valuable.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nThe one consistent complaint students had about this course was the amount of required readings that were critical to doing well in the class. Students stated they felt \u201crushed to finish all readings,\u201d and that some were \u201ctoo long and repetitive,\u201d despite the general interest they rendered. \r\n", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/17538/sections/401/reviews/666-STEVEN-FEIERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/666-STEVEN-FEIERMAN", "first_name": "STEVEN", "last_name": "FEIERMAN", "id": "666-STEVEN-FEIERMAN", "name": "STEVEN FEIERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 68, "id": "17538-401-666-STEVEN-FEIERMAN"}]
