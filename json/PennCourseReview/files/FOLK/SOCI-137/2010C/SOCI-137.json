One student said, \"I loved this course--I definitely learned a lot. Despite being a long class at the end of the day, paying attention in class was never an issue.\" However, there was some mention of the course material being out of date. One student noted, \"The material could be updated. Pop culture today is not the same as pop culture in the 80s.\"\r\n\r\nStudents by and large liked Professor Rubin. Professor Rubin ensures that students keep up with course content throughout the semester by consistently giving quizzes. \u201cWhile demanding, it is effective.\u201d Many found her to be \u201ca great instructor.\u201d On the other hand, some criticized her teaching method because of the volume of reading and the weight of the quizzes on one's overall grade. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of reading every week, but it is said to be manageable. There were four quizzes (15% of the overall grade) on the reading so students did have to pay attention to detail. This course has no prerequisite and fulfills the Society Sector requirement.\r\n", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/23793/sections/601/reviews/5678-MOLLIE-RUBIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5678-MOLLIE-RUBIN", "first_name": "MOLLIE", "last_name": "RUBIN", "id": "5678-MOLLIE-RUBIN", "name": "MOLLIE RUBIN"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "23793-601-5678-MOLLIE-RUBIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-137", "path": "/courses/23793", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23793/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOC.
