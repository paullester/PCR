{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/490"}, "description": "This course focuses on the transnational ethnicity of Latino American memoir and literature from the Spanish Caribbean. The landscapes of the islands of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic act as tropes for situating history and identity for Caribe-Flo-American authors. The tropicality of the islands serve as a way of situating the present and the past in its contrast tothe urban-American sites of New York, Miami, and New Jersey. Authors explored in the course include among others, Esmeralda Santiago, Christina Garcia, Julia Alvarez and Junot D-Ebaz. Their writings show the bifurcated and flucating nature of Latino Amrican identity in relation to language, religion, and quotidian life. The textualization of an \"imagined\" history through metaphores of la isla / the island, illustrates the precarious, yet rich nature of \"alternate\" American narratives in ethnic literature. In assessing how these narratives of home identity and place add to urban American milieus we will point towards processes evident in the construction and experience of current global identities. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "DREAMING THE ISLAND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/490/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.80", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "DREAMING THE ISLAND", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "FOLK-227-601", "path": "/courses/490/sections/601", "id": "490-601", "aliases": ["FOLK-227-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/490/sections/601/reviews/526-SOLIMAR-OTERO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/526-SOLIMAR-OTERO", "first_name": "SOLIMAR", "last_name": "OTERO", "id": "526-SOLIMAR-OTERO", "name": "SOLIMAR OTERO"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "490-601-526-SOLIMAR-OTERO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FOLK-227", "path": "/courses/490", "sections": {"path": "/courses/490/sections", "values": [{"name": "DREAMING THE ISLAND", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "FOLK-227-601", "path": "/courses/490/sections/601", "id": "490-601", "aliases": ["FOLK-227-601"]}]}, "id": 490, "aliases": ["FOLK-227"]}
