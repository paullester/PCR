{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3552"}, "description": "How do words transform people, places, and events in ways that bring about social change? What are the motivations, methods, politics and implications of \"doing good work?\" How does an understanding of doing good work depend on ones position: as non-profit worker, social justice advocate, community activist, business person? In this interdisciplinary seminar we will cover current issues surrounding social initiatives in many forms of literature: from fiction and non-fiction, to exhibits, web-sites, on-line journals, grant-proposals, and ethnographic documentaries. Students will be given an opportunity to do participatory research on local concerns: witnessing, critiquing, and putting words into action and thereby gain pratical knowledge about how artists express themselves in ways that impact and empower local community arts, cultural and education programs. Students may, for example work in programs to learn about how art and community performance can bring people together through location, spirit and tradition ccan empower people to adress difficult social issues. And, as art, after all, is not only created by artist and craftsperons, but disseminated bothe informally and formally -- through schools, museums and programs -- we will also explore how particular policies affect society and local culture. \n\n", "semester": "2005B", "name": "LITERATURE AND ACTIVISM: Bread and Roses: Artistic Expression and Community Activism", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11196/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "LITERATURE AND ACTIVISM: Bread and Roses: Artistic Expression and Community Activism", "sectionnum": "940", "primary_alias": "FOLK-580-940", "path": "/courses/11196/sections/940", "id": "11196-940", "aliases": ["FOLK-580-940"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/11196/sections/940/reviews/3560-NANCY-WATTERSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3560-NANCY-WATTERSON", "first_name": "NANCY", "last_name": "WATTERSON", "id": "3560-NANCY-WATTERSON", "name": "NANCY WATTERSON"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "11196-940-3560-NANCY-WATTERSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FOLK-580", "path": "/courses/11196", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11196/sections", "values": [{"name": "LITERATURE AND ACTIVISM: Bread and Roses: Artistic Expression and Community Activism", "sectionnum": "940", "primary_alias": "FOLK-580-940", "path": "/courses/11196/sections/940", "id": "11196-940", "aliases": ["FOLK-580-940"]}]}, "id": 11196, "aliases": ["FOLK-580"]}
