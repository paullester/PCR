{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2109"}, "description": "This course will examine traditional systems of supernatural belief with an emphasis on the role of personal experience in their development and maintenance. The course will focus on subjects of belief generally conceived of as being \"folk\" in some sense (e.g., beliefs in ghosts), but will not exclude a consideration of popular and academic beliefs where appropriate (e.g., popular beliefs about UFO's and theological doctrines of the immortality of the soul). The course will be multidisciplinary in scope. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "ETHNOGRAPHY OF BELIEF", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3462/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "ETHNOGRAPHY OF BELIEF", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-507-401", "path": "/courses/3462/sections/401", "id": "3462-401", "aliases": ["RELS-507-401", "FOLK-510-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/3462/sections/401/reviews/531-DAVID-J-HUFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/531-DAVID-J-HUFFORD", "first_name": "DAVID J", "last_name": "HUFFORD", "id": "531-DAVID-J-HUFFORD", "name": "DAVID J HUFFORD"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "3462-401-531-DAVID-J-HUFFORD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-507", "path": "/courses/3462", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3462/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHNOGRAPHY OF BELIEF", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-507-401", "path": "/courses/3462/sections/401", "id": "3462-401", "aliases": ["RELS-507-401", "FOLK-510-401"]}]}, "id": 3462, "aliases": ["RELS-507", "FOLK-510"]}
