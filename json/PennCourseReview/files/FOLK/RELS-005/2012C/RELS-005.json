By using historical, psychoanalytical and anthropological tools, we will explore the various ways in which religion shapes gender roles and vice-versa. Aspects considered will include the representation of the divine, the role of women in religious institutions, and rules regarding the human body, marriage and sexuality. We will also take into consideration contemporary women's self-representation in religious literature, art, and film. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "WOMEN AND RELIGION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29597/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN AND RELIGION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-005-401", "path": "/courses/29597/sections/401", "id": "29597-401", "aliases": ["RELS-005-401", "FOLK-029-401", "GSWS-109-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/29597/sections/401/reviews/6398-TAMMIE-R-WANTA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6398-TAMMIE-R-WANTA", "first_name": "TAMMIE R", "last_name": "WANTA", "id": "6398-TAMMIE-R-WANTA", "name": "TAMMIE R WANTA"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "29597-401-6398-TAMMIE-R-WANTA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-005", "path": "/courses/29597", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29597/sections", "values": [{"name": "WOMEN AND RELIGION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-005-401", "path": "/courses/29597/sections/401", "id": "29597-401", "aliases": ["RELS-005-401", "FOLK-029-401", "GSWS-109-401"]}]}, "id": 29597, "aliases": ["RELS-005", "FOLK-029", "GSWS-109"]}
