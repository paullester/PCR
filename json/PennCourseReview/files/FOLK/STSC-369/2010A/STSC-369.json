{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3982"}, "description": "One nanometer is about ten hydrogen atoms long. So \"nanotechnology\" is the art of building useful tools out of very small numbers of atoms. This class will investigate what is being done in nanotechnology, and what is being forecast for its potential. We will take a long look at the prehistory of nanotechnology, then map out what institutions and groups have a stake in the field. Throughout the course, will discuss the ways that nanotechnology is a product of society, and the ways its products in turn change society. Topics include: microelectronics and Moore's Law; futurism and science fiction; controversies and public perception; government sponsorship of nano; universities and commerce. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "NANOTECHNOLOGY AND SOCIE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26825/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.15", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "2.70", "rCourseQuality": "2.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.55", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.45", "rInstructorQuality": "2.52"}, "section": {"name": "NANOTECHNOLOGY AND SOCIE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-369-401", "path": "/courses/26825/sections/401", "id": "26825-401", "aliases": ["STSC-369-401", "HSOC-369-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/26825/sections/401/reviews/3909-JODY-A-ROBERTS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3909-JODY-A-ROBERTS", "first_name": "JODY A", "last_name": "ROBERTS", "id": "3909-JODY-A-ROBERTS", "name": "JODY A ROBERTS"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "26825-401-3909-JODY-A-ROBERTS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-369", "path": "/courses/26825", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26825/sections", "values": [{"name": "NANOTECHNOLOGY AND SOCIE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-369-401", "path": "/courses/26825/sections/401", "id": "26825-401", "aliases": ["STSC-369-401", "HSOC-369-401"]}]}, "id": 26825, "aliases": ["STSC-369", "HSOC-369"]}
