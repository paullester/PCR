{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3406"}, "description": "This course will explore the history of America's use and fascination with material goods between 1600 and 1860. We will examine such issues as the transferal of European traditions of material culture to the New World, the creation of American creolized forms, the impact of reformers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and the development of regional landscapes. Thematic issues will include consumerism, objects as symbolic communication and metaphor, and the complementary issues of archaeology and history of art in material culture study. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "MATERIAL LIFE IN AMER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9068/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "MATERIAL LIFE IN AMER", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-323-401", "path": "/courses/9068/sections/401", "id": "9068-401", "aliases": ["HIST-323-401", "FOLK-323-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/9068/sections/401/reviews/639-ROBERT-B--ST-GEORGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/639-ROBERT-B--ST-GEORGE", "first_name": "ROBERT B.", "last_name": "ST.GEORGE", "id": "639-ROBERT-B--ST-GEORGE", "name": "ROBERT B.
