Film is arguably the most powerful medium for reflecting changes in modern society. This course will examine Russia's transition to democracy and market economy through the eyes of its most creative and controversial cinematographers. The course will focus on the often agonizing process of changing values and attitudes as the country moves from Soviet to Post-Soviet society. Russian films with English subtitles will be supplemented by readings from contemporary Russian media sources. The course provides an excellent visual introduction to the problems of contemporary Russia society. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "POST-SOV RUSSIA IN FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16434/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "POST-SOV RUSSIA IN FILM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-460-001", "path": "/courses/16434/sections/001", "id": "16434-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-460-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/16434/sections/001/reviews/1068-MARIA-V--BOURLATSKAYA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1068-MARIA-V--BOURLATSKAYA", "first_name": "MARIA V.", "last_name": "BOURLATSKAYA", "id": "1068-MARIA-V--BOURLATSKAYA", "name": "MARIA V.
