{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/998"}, "description": "This course explores the ways Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881) portrays the \"inner world(s)\" of his characters. Dostoevsky's psychological method will be considered against the historical, ideological, and literary contexts of middle to late nineteenth-century Russia. The course consists of three parts External World (the contexts of Dostoevsky), \"Inside\" Dostoevsky's World (the author's technique and ideas) and The World of Text (close reading of Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov). Students will write three essays on various aspects of Dostoevsky's \"spiritual realism.\" \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DOSTOEVSKY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29614/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64", "rCommAbility": "3.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "DOSTOEVSKY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-201-301", "path": "/courses/29614/sections/301", "id": "29614-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-201-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/29614/sections/301/reviews/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "first_name": "ILYA", "last_name": "VINITSKY", "id": "2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "name": "ILYA VINITSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "29614-301-2325-ILYA-VINITSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-201", "path": "/courses/29614", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29614/sections", "values": [{"name": "DOSTOEVSKY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-201-301", "path": "/courses/29614/sections/301", "id": "29614-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-201-301"]}]}, "id": 29614, "aliases": ["RUSS-201"]}
