{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2114"}, "description": "How can Russia's past help us to understand Russia today? How do such deeply rooted traditions as autocracy, rebellion, reform, religion and folk ways continue to influence modern Russian society, political thought, and culture? This course will investigate such questions by looking at the roots and development of Russian society. It will examine a wide range of cultural expression that spans the period from the origins of Rus' through the early Nineteenth century. Particular emphasis will be placed on the interconnections between art, architecture, literature, religion, and thought. Attention will also be paid to the myth, ritual, and world-view of the Russian peasantry and its role in modern Russian life. Topics to be addressed include views of national and cultural identity, ethnicities, westernization, the dialogue between \"high culture\" and \"folk culture,\" religion, and the cult of personality. Films will be used occasionally. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "INTRO TO RUSS CIV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3470/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "2.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO RUSS CIV", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-105-001", "path": "/courses/3470/sections/001", "id": "3470-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-105-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/3470/sections/001/reviews/1706-ZINAIDA-P-VAGANOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1706-ZINAIDA-P-VAGANOVA", "first_name": "ZINAIDA P", "last_name": "VAGANOVA", "id": "1706-ZINAIDA-P-VAGANOVA", "name": "ZINAIDA P VAGANOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "3470-001-1706-ZINAIDA-P-VAGANOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-105", "path": "/courses/3470", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3470/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO RUSS CIV", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-105-001", "path": "/courses/3470/sections/001", "id": "3470-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-105-001"]}]}, "id": 3470, "aliases": ["RUSS-105"]}
