{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5355"}, "description": "This course continues developing students advanced skills in Russian. Since th e breakup of the Soviet Union twenty years ago, Russians have been intensively re-digesting their history. Both the more distant past (the era of princes, t sars and emperors) and the recent past (the times of communist leaders Lenin and Stalin) have gained new meanings in light of the post-Soviet transformation of Russian politics. What is the meaning of Russias religious heritage in the t wenty-first century? What is the nature of Russias relationship to Europe? Was Stalins murderous suppression of millions a fair price for the modernization of Russia into the Soviet superpower? Who in the present day should bear the guilt for Soviet-era abuses and war crimes? These are some of the questions we will study, by means of examinations of contemporary Russian journalism, literature and film. All class discussions and primary sources will be in Russian. Some secondary readings will be in English. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "POLITICS OF RUSS HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26736/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "POLITICS OF RUSS HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-409-301", "path": "/courses/26736/sections/301", "id": "26736-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-409-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/26736/sections/301/reviews/1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "first_name": "KEVIN M.F.", "last_name": "PLATT", "id": "1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "name": "KEVIN M.F.
