{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2403"}, "description": "In this course, we will read and discuss ghost stories written by some of the most well-known Russian writers. The goal of the course is threefold: to familiarize the students with brilliant and thrilling texts which represent various periods of Russian literature; to examine the artistic features of ghost stories and to explore their ideological implications. With attention to relevant scholarship (Freud, Todorov, Derrida, Greenblatt), we will pose questions about the role of the storyteller in ghost stories, and about horror and the fantastic. We will also ponder gender and class, controversy over sense and sensation, spiritual significance and major changes in attitudes toward the supernatural. \n\nWe will consider the concept of the apparition as a peculiar cultural myth, which tells us about the \"dark side\" of the Russian literary imagination and about the historical and political conflicts which have haunted Russian minds in previous centuries. Readings will include literary works by Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov, and Bulgakov, as well as works by some lesser, yet extremely interesting, authors. We will also read excerpts from major treatises regarding spiritualism, including Swedenborg, Kant, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Mme Blavatsky. The course consists of 28 sessions (\"nights\") and includes film presentations and horrifying slides. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "RUSSIAN GHOST STORIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25073/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.41", "rDifficulty": "1.44", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "RUSSIAN GHOST STORIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-130-301", "path": "/courses/25073/sections/301", "id": "25073-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-130-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/25073/sections/301/reviews/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "first_name": "ILYA", "last_name": "VINITSKY", "id": "2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "name": "ILYA VINITSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "25073-301-2325-ILYA-VINITSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-130", "path": "/courses/25073", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25073/sections", "values": [{"name": "RUSSIAN GHOST STORIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-130-301", "path": "/courses/25073/sections/301", "id": "25073-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-130-301"]}]}, "id": 25073, "aliases": ["RUSS-130"]}
