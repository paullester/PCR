{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/997"}, "description": "The collapse of communism in the world's largest country and the transition to new political, social, and economic modes have resulted in profound changes for the people in Russia and in the rest of the world -- changes that have brought an unprecedented diversity of opportunity for some, and for others, severe restrictions. \n\nHow do 19th and 20th century Russia and the Soviet Union give meaning to 21st century Russia? This course investigates this question by looking at the interconnections between literature, the visual and theater arts, religion and society. Film, works of art, literary texts, manifestoes, ethnographies, and memoirs will be used in examining such topics as art in society, revolutionary thought, utopian and distopian visions, mythmaking, the status of women, youth culture, and changing values in post-communist society. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "INTRO TO RUSSIAN CIV II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/997/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "2.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.46", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO RUSSIAN CIV II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-106-001", "path": "/courses/997/sections/001", "id": "997-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-106-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/997/sections/001/reviews/1064-DARIA-A-KIRJANOV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1064-DARIA-A-KIRJANOV", "first_name": "DARIA A", "last_name": "KIRJANOV", "id": "1064-DARIA-A-KIRJANOV", "name": "DARIA A KIRJANOV"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "997-001-1064-DARIA-A-KIRJANOV"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-106", "path": "/courses/997", "sections": {"path": "/courses/997/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO RUSSIAN CIV II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-106-001", "path": "/courses/997/sections/001", "id": "997-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-106-001"]}]}, "id": 997, "aliases": ["RUSS-106"]}
