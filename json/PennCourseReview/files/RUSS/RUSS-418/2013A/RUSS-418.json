{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4411"}, "description": "This course continues developing students' advanced skills in Russian, while surveying main social, political and cultural developments in Russia since 1991. In these two turbulent decades Russia has undergone colossal changes ranging from disintegration of the Soviet Empire to the rapid development of new gastronomical tastes and new trends in literature and culture. The course will explore diverse and often conflicting cultural sensibilities in contemporary Russian fiction, poetry, journalism, scholarly writing, performance art, as well as in pop-culture and film. Topics under consideration will include reassessing Russia's luminous cultural heritage as well as traumatic periods in Soviet history; search for identity and the recent drift towards neo-nationalism; gender issues and the contemporary focus on fatherlessness; changing attitudes towards former cultural taboos; dealing with Russia's current political and cultural dilemmas. The course also incorporates two advanced Russian colloquiums with guest appearances of Prof. Kevin Platt and Ilya Vinitsky. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "RUSS CULT&SOCIETY NOW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30974/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "RUSS CULT&SOCIETY NOW", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-418-001", "path": "/courses/30974/sections/001", "id": "30974-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-418-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/30974/sections/001/reviews/5869-MARIA-ALLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5869-MARIA-ALLEY", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "ALLEY", "id": "5869-MARIA-ALLEY", "name": "MARIA ALLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "30974-001-5869-MARIA-ALLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-418", "path": "/courses/30974", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30974/sections", "values": [{"name": "RUSS CULT&SOCIETY NOW", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-418-001", "path": "/courses/30974/sections/001", "id": "30974-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-418-001"]}]}, "id": 30974, "aliases": ["RUSS-418"]}
