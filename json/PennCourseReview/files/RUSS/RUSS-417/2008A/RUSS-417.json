{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3239"}, "description": "This course continues developing students' advanced skills in Russian, while closely studying a representative selection of texts from the modernist period. The course will explore central issues of the period, such as the relationship between literature and revolution, reconceptualizations of society, history and the self. Of particular interest will be authors' experimentation in form and language in order to present afresh the experience of life. Textual study is combined with a general overview of the period, including reference to parallel trends in the visual arts, architecture and music, as well as contemporary intellectual movements. Principal writers studied will include Belyi, Sologub, Remizov, Andreev, Artsybashev, Gorky, Zamiatin, Pilnyak, Platonov, Zoshchenko, Babel, Olesha, and Kharms. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "Russian Modernism: Literature, Music and Visual Arts", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20804/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "Russian Modernism: Literature, Music and Visual Arts", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-417-001", "path": "/courses/20804/sections/001", "id": "20804-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-417-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/20804/sections/001/reviews/2677-MARIA-A-SHARDAKOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2677-MARIA-A-SHARDAKOVA", "first_name": "MARIA A", "last_name": "SHARDAKOVA", "id": "2677-MARIA-A-SHARDAKOVA", "name": "MARIA A SHARDAKOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "20804-001-2677-MARIA-A-SHARDAKOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-417", "path": "/courses/20804", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20804/sections", "values": [{"name": "Russian Modernism: Literature, Music and Visual Arts", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-417-001", "path": "/courses/20804/sections/001", "id": "20804-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-417-001"]}]}, "id": 20804, "aliases": ["RUSS-417"]}
