To an extent, humor is a gateway to national mentality. In the present course we will examine Russian cultural history, from the sixteenth through the twenty-first centuries, through the vehicle of Russian humor. How does Russian humor depend on religion and history? What was considered funny in various cultural trends? What are the peculiarities of Russian humorist tradition? Students will be familiarized with different Russian theories of humor (Bakhtin, Likhachev, Panchenko, Tynianov, etc.) and, of course, with a variety of works by Russian kings of humor Pushkin and Gogol, Chekhov and Zoshchenko, Bulgakov and Ilf and Petrov, Erofeev and Kibirov, etc. Class lectures will be supplemented by frequent video and musical presentations ranging from contemporary cartoons to high comedies and from comic songs (Chaliapins The Flea) to the music of Shostakovich (The Nose). \n\nThis course is intended for students who have spoken Russian at home and seek to improve their capabilities in formal and professional uses of the Russian language. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "RUSSIAN HUMOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23755/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "1.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.81", "rRecommendMajor": "3.81", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "RUSSIAN HUMOR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-464-301", "path": "/courses/23755/sections/301", "id": "23755-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-464-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/23755/sections/301/reviews/3177-SVETLANA-KORSHUNOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3177-SVETLANA-KORSHUNOVA", "first_name": "SVETLANA", "last_name": "KORSHUNOVA", "id": "3177-SVETLANA-KORSHUNOVA", "name": "SVETLANA KORSHUNOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "23755-301-3177-SVETLANA-KORSHUNOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-464", "path": "/courses/23755", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23755/sections", "values": [{"name": "RUSSIAN HUMOR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-464-301", "path": "/courses/23755/sections/301", "id": "23755-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-464-301"]}]}, "id": 23755, "aliases": ["RUSS-464"]}
