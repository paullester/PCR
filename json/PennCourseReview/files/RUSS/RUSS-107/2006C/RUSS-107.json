{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2676"}, "description": "The goal of RUSS107 is to provide students of Russian language and students who spoke Russian at home with formalized opportunities to improve their conversation and comprehension skills while experiencing various aspects of Russian culture. There will be no weekly assignments or readings, but all students will be expected to contribute at a level equivalent to their Russian-speaking abilities both in class and on the newsletter final project. The course consists of attending regular conversation hours in addition to a tea-drinking hour in the department (F 4-5pm), film viewings, and a single outside cultural event (e.g., a concert of Russian music at the Kimmel Center). \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "Russian Outside the Classroom I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9512/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "Russian Outside the Classroom I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-107-301", "path": "/courses/9512/sections/301", "id": "9512-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-107-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/9512/sections/301/reviews/3178-ALINA-Y-YAKUBOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3178-ALINA-Y-YAKUBOVA", "first_name": "ALINA Y", "last_name": "YAKUBOVA", "id": "3178-ALINA-Y-YAKUBOVA", "name": "ALINA Y YAKUBOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "9512-301-3178-ALINA-Y-YAKUBOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-107", "path": "/courses/9512", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9512/sections", "values": [{"name": "Russian Outside the Classroom I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-107-301", "path": "/courses/9512/sections/301", "id": "9512-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-107-301"]}]}, "id": 9512, "aliases": ["RUSS-107"]}
