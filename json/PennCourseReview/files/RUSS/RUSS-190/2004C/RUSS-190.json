{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2405"}, "description": "This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods, causes, various codes, and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism, anarchism, and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate, delegitimize and ultimately neutralize terrorist networks in late imperial Russia. \n\nThe discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation, terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking, the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers, their maniacal self-denial, revolutionary asceticism, underground mentality, faceless omnipotence, and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. \n\nWe analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate asymmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe, the Balkans, and America. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "TERRORISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5861/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.02", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.94", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "TERRORISM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "RUSS-190-001", "path": "/courses/5861/sections/001", "id": "5861-001", "aliases": ["RUSS-190-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/5861/sections/001/reviews/1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "first_name": "VLADISLAV T.", "last_name": "TODOROV", "id": "1066-VLADISLAV-T--TODOROV", "name": "VLADISLAV T.
