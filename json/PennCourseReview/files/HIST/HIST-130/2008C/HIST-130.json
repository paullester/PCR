{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2309"}, "description": "Globalization seems the essence of modernity, but it is not a new phenomena. The world has already witnessed several eras of globalization, each of which transformed and changed the world in often similar but sometime unique fashions. This course will look at continuing trends towards globalization and consider its rich history and the contentious arguments that it has always provoked. Although the focus of the course will be on globalization during the 19th and 20th centuries, we will also consider earlier episodes of globalization, to fully appreciate its evolution and importance. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "HISTORY OF GLOBALIZATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18806/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.39", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.12", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "HISTORY OF GLOBALIZATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-130-001", "path": "/courses/18806/sections/001", "id": "18806-001", "aliases": ["HIST-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/18806/sections/001/reviews/614-JERRY-DREW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/614-JERRY-DREW", "first_name": "JERRY", "last_name": "DREW", "id": "614-JERRY-DREW", "name": "JERRY DREW"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "18806-001-614-JERRY-DREW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-130", "path": "/courses/18806", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18806/sections", "values": [{"name": "HISTORY OF GLOBALIZATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-130-001", "path": "/courses/18806/sections/001", "id": "18806-001", "aliases": ["HIST-130-001"]}]}, "id": 18806, "aliases": ["HIST-130"]}
