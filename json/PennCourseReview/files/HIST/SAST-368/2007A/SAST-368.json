{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4128"}, "description": "This course introduces advanced undergraduates and graduate students to methodsof doing and writing history that intervene within dominant historical narratives and frameworks by redefining historians' relationships with sources and the questions asked of them. The Subaltern Studies collective that emergedin South Asia in the 1980s and 1990s is now recognized as one of the more important historical interventions in recent years. Subaltern Studies' historiographic writing has questioned dominant nationalist narratives by that they represent only the history of elites. The objective of this course is to draw attention to differing understandings of colonialism and nationalism by laying out the perspectives of \"subalterns\"-untouchables, tribals, peasants, workers, women and other marginalized groups. In addition, \"subaltern\" perspectives will also be applied to the study of themes like democracy, politics, modernity, development, cities, the environment, and the mass media in South Asia. The interventions made by the Subaltern Studies collective will be situated in relationship to developments in European historiography, with special attention to the unique departures of this new school. Debates within and critiques of the collective's approach will also be examined. A background in South Asian history or culture is not a prerequisite; \n\nhowever some exposure to historiography or current debates in cultural theory is desirable \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "History from Below: Colonialism, Nationalism & Subalterns in South Asia", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15146/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "History from Below: Colonialism, Nationalism & Subalterns in South Asia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-368-401", "path": "/courses/15146/sections/401", "id": "15146-401", "aliases": ["SAST-368-401", "HIST-382-401", "SAST-568-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/15146/sections/401/reviews/4095-RAMNARAYAN-SINGH-RAWAT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4095-RAMNARAYAN-SINGH-RAWAT", "first_name": "RAMNARAYAN SINGH", "last_name": "RAWAT", "id": "4095-RAMNARAYAN-SINGH-RAWAT", "name": "RAMNARAYAN SINGH RAWAT"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "15146-401-4095-RAMNARAYAN-SINGH-RAWAT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-368", "path": "/courses/15146", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15146/sections", "values": [{"name": "History from Below: Colonialism, Nationalism & Subalterns in South Asia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-368-401", "path": "/courses/15146/sections/401", "id": "15146-401", "aliases": ["SAST-368-401", "HIST-382-401", "SAST-568-401"]}]}, "id": 15146, "aliases": ["SAST-368", "HIST-382", "SAST-568"]}
