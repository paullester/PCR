It considers the civil rights movement, the New Frontier and Great Society, the Supreme Court and right politics, the rise of the New Right, the debate over Vietnam, student radicalism, sexual liberation movements, black power, the counterculture, the urban crisis, and white backlash. The course emphasizes the transformation of liberalism and the revitalization of conservatism, and the tensions between integration and separatism, between libertarianism and communitarianism that shaped the social movements of the sixties.\r\n\r\nStudents expressed immense satisfaction with this course.  Class members appreciated both the content as well as the manner in which it was presented.  A few students noted that the breadth of material occasionally made certain topics seem \u201crushed,\u201d however, more students praised the \u201clevel of depth\u201d of the lectures and readings, alike.  Students claimed that class meetings appeared \u201cto fly by.\u201d  \r\n\r\nProfessor Sugrue received tremendous praise as an \u201centhusiastic,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201cdynamic\u201d professor.  Students valued his use of \u201chumor and anecdotes\u201d to enhance the concepts.  He was further described as \u201cknowledgeable and passionate\u201d about his subject matter.  Students regretted that the course was so large, which hindered their ability to develop personal relationships with Professor Sugrue, despite his availability and approachability.\r\n\r\nStudents found the workload \u201cchallenging, but worthwhile.\u201d  Readings were \u201cquite lengthy\u201d, but were not considered too burdensome because they were \u201cso interesting.\u201d  Students expressed a bit of frustration that there were not frequent assessments \u2013 just a midterm and final.  However, students found the tests fair, so long as readings had been completed and class had been attended.  As the course is a higher-level course, many students were history majors, but a considerable number of non-majors took the course as well.  Both categories overwhelmingly recommended the course to others.\r\n", "num_students": 145, "path": "/courses/27589/sections/401/reviews/2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE", "first_name": "THOMAS J.", "last_name": "SUGRUE", "id": "2779-THOMAS-J--SUGRUE", "name": "THOMAS J.
