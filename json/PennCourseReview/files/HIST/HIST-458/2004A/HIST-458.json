{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2846"}, "description": "The civil war in China from 1945-1949 was one of the most important events in twentieth century Chinese history, for it brought the Communists to power in Beijing and drove the previous Nationalist government to Taiwan, creating a situation, and unresolved tensions, that persist to this day. Yet historians have never been able to agree abouth the character of the war--was it a true revolutionary \"people's war\" or a \"peasant rebellion\" as many argued in the 1960s and early 1970s? Or is it better analyzed as a military struggle, in which comparable armies fight, and win or lose based on the Clausewitzian trinity of passion, reason and chance? Much new material has come to light over the past decade, particularly in China and Professor Waldron is completing an edition of Mao Zedong's writings during the war. This course, a seminar, will look at the war very broadly. Of course we will consider the military campaigns, but we will also look at society at the time, the international background (especially US and Soviet roles), and reporting of the war, reading some of the classic journalistic accounts. Finally, we will look at how scholarly understanding of the war has developed and changed both inside China and out during the half century since its end. Open to qualified, serious students, especially those interested in China or military \n\nstrategy and war broadly understood. English alone will get you through the course fine, but knowledge of Chinese is certainly desirable. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6697/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.33", "rCommAbility": "2.53", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HIST-458-301", "path": "/courses/6697/sections/301", "id": "6697-301", "aliases": ["HIST-458-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/6697/sections/301/reviews/628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON", "first_name": "ARTHUR N.", "last_name": "WALDRON", "id": "628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON", "name": "ARTHUR N.
