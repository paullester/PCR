{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1899"}, "description": "The course follows the evolution of industrial capitalism since the beginning of the English industrial revolution in the late 18th century. It ranges from the problems of the industrial revolution in England to problems of building a market economy in eastern Europe today. In particular, it examines industrialization and explores the sources of sustained economic growth from a comparative perspective. Most of the world, especially in so-called emerging economies, is still confronted with the challenge, and often pain, of creating a modern industrial capitalist society. The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law, anti-trust, corporate forms, banking institutions, industrial relations, etc. By definition, the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world, but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27560/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.48", "rRecommendMajor": "3.79", "rCourseQuality": "3.41", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.61", "rInstructorQuality": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-107-001", "path": "/courses/27560/sections/001", "id": "27560-001", "aliases": ["HIST-107-001"]}, "comments": "The course follows the evolution of industrial capitalism since the beginning of the English industrial revolution in the late 18th century.

As one student explained, \u201cThe course taught me a lot of interesting and valuable knowledge about economic history that I have been able to apply in other areas of study.\u201d Many students admitted that they had originally been skeptical, but were pleasantly surprised by the course. The major critique\u2014voiced by many students\u2014was that the course focused on presentations and discussion, while many students would have preferred more lecture and more explanation of overarching concepts. Although a few students felt that the class lacked organization, most students felt they learned a lot. According to one student, \u201cThis class blended history and economics in a way that was interesting and accessible to students from a variety of academic backgrounds. I felt that this class encouraged the development of critical thinking skills and the ability to summarize long, complex readings... This has been one of the most interesting and engaging classes I've taken at Penn.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll students surveyed enjoyed Professor Drew\u2019s teaching. Students felt that he was engaging, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and able to present the content in an interesting and engaging manner. \u201cProfessor Drew was a reasonable and knowledgeable professor whose excitement and enthusiasm for the course really grasped my interest. I will certainly be back for more classes taught by him,\u201d one student wrote. A couple of students remarked that Professor Drew was a favorite professor at Penn. As one explained, \u201cHis personable approach to teaching and his availability outside of class, particularly his interest in our paper topics and research help, has created a strong bond between Professor Drew and his students.\u201d Professor Drew also actively engages the class through participation and presentations, which allows students to reflect on their own learning and develop important presentation skills for the future.\r\n\r\nThis class requires presentation and class participation, which the majority of students felt helped them learn the material. As one student wrote, \u201cthe professor's idea to do presentations has been very useful in helping his students learn to discuss material in front of an audience, which is a necessary skill.\u201d", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/27560/sections/001/reviews/614-JERRY-DREW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/614-JERRY-DREW", "first_name": "JERRY", "last_name": "DREW", "id": "614-JERRY-DREW", "name": "JERRY DREW"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "27560-001-614-JERRY-DREW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-107", "path": "/courses/27560", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27560/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-107-001", "path": "/courses/27560/sections/001", "id": "27560-001", "aliases": ["HIST-107-001"]}]}, "id": 27560, "aliases": ["HIST-107"]}
