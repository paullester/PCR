{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1899"}, "description": "The course follows the evolution of industrial capitalism since the beginning of the English industrial revolution in the late 18th century. It ranges from the problems of the industrial revolution in England to problems of building a market economy in eastern Europe today. In particular, it examines industrialization and explores the sources of sustained economic growth from a comparative perspective. Most of the world, especially in so-called emerging economies, is still confronted with the challenge, and often pain, of creating a modern industrial capitalist society. The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law, anti-trust, corporate forms, banking institutions, industrial relations, etc. By definition, the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world, but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11946/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.35", "rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.35", "rWorkRequired": "3.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.68", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-107-001", "path": "/courses/11946/sections/001", "id": "11946-001", "aliases": ["HIST-107-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/11946/sections/001/reviews/614-JERRY-DREW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/614-JERRY-DREW", "first_name": "JERRY", "last_name": "DREW", "id": "614-JERRY-DREW", "name": "JERRY DREW"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "11946-001-614-JERRY-DREW"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.93", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.40", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "HIST-107-002", "path": "/courses/11946/sections/002", "id": "11946-002", "aliases": ["HIST-107-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/11946/sections/002/reviews/614-JERRY-DREW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/614-JERRY-DREW", "first_name": "JERRY", "last_name": "DREW", "id": "614-JERRY-DREW", "name": "JERRY DREW"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "11946-002-614-JERRY-DREW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-107", "path": "/courses/11946", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11946/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-107-001", "path": "/courses/11946/sections/001", "id": "11946-001", "aliases": ["HIST-107-001"]}, {"name": "COMP CAPITALIST SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "HIST-107-002", "path": "/courses/11946/sections/002", "id": "11946-002", "aliases": ["HIST-107-002"]}]}, "id": 11946, "aliases": ["HIST-107"]}
