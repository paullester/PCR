{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/566"}, "description": "This course examines American history from the first contacts of the indigenous peoples of North America with European settlers to our own times by focusing on a few telling moments in this history. The course treats twelve of these moments. Each unit begins with a specific primary document, historical figure, image, location, year, or cultural artifact to commence the delving into the American past. Some of these icons are familiar, but the ensuing deciphering will render them as more complicated; some are unfamiliar, but they will emerge as absolutely telling. The course meets each week for two 50-minute team-taught lectures and once recitation session. Course requirements include: in-class midterm and final exams; three short paper assignments; and punctual attendance and participation in recitations. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "LECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/566/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.04", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.09", "rCommAbility": "3.39", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-011-001", "path": "/courses/566/sections/001", "id": "566-001", "aliases": ["HIST-011-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/566/sections/001/reviews/609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "first_name": "ELISA", "last_name": "VON JOEDEN-FORGEY", "id": "609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "name": "ELISA VON JOEDEN-FORGEY"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "566-001-609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-011", "path": "/courses/566", "sections": {"path": "/courses/566/sections", "values": [{"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-011-001", "path": "/courses/566/sections/001", "id": "566-001", "aliases": ["HIST-011-001"]}]}, "id": 566, "aliases": ["HIST-011"]}
