{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2437"}, "description": "This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to various perspectives and philosophies that have dominated the discourse on urban poverty throughout history. The course is primarily concerned with the ways in which historical, cultural, political, racial, social, geographical, and economic forces have either shaped or been left out of contemporary debates on urban poverty. Of great importance, the course will evaluate competing knowledge systems and their respective implications in terms of the questions of what can be known about urban poverty in the contexts of policy circles, academic literature, and the broader social imaginary. We will critically analyze a wide body of literature seeking to theorize urban poverty, ranging from sociological, anthropological/ethnographic, geographical, Marxist, historical, social welfare, and cultural analyses. Primacy will be granted to critical analysis of course readings, particularly with regard to the ways in which various knowledge systems - or \"regimes of truth\" - create, sustain, and constrict meaning in reference to urban poverty. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "PERSP ON URBAN POVERTY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15265/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "3.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.95", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "PERSP ON URBAN POVERTY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-420-401", "path": "/courses/15265/sections/401", "id": "15265-401", "aliases": ["URBS-420-401", "SOCI-420-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/15265/sections/401/reviews/1974-TODD-A--WOLFSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1974-TODD-A--WOLFSON", "first_name": "TODD A.", "last_name": "WOLFSON", "id": "1974-TODD-A--WOLFSON", "name": "TODD A.
