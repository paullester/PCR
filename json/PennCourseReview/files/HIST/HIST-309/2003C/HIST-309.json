{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1909"}, "description": "The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century was a watershed in European history. It marked the culmination of centuries of religious, political and social change and had profound institutional and intellectual consequences. We will examine the central teachings and activities of the Protestant reformers against this broad background. Topics will include: medieval traditions of religious protest and reform; social and political changes in the period of the Reformation; the changing role of the Papacy; and the impact of the new technology of printing. Readings will be both primary texts and secondary sources and discussions will be an integral part of the class. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "AGE OF REFORMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4264/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "AGE OF REFORMATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-309-001", "path": "/courses/4264/sections/001", "id": "4264-001", "aliases": ["HIST-309-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/4264/sections/001/reviews/2179-DEBRA-KAPLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2179-DEBRA-KAPLAN", "first_name": "DEBRA", "last_name": "KAPLAN", "id": "2179-DEBRA-KAPLAN", "name": "DEBRA KAPLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "4264-001-2179-DEBRA-KAPLAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-309", "path": "/courses/4264", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4264/sections", "values": [{"name": "AGE OF REFORMATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-309-001", "path": "/courses/4264/sections/001", "id": "4264-001", "aliases": ["HIST-309-001"]}]}, "id": 4264, "aliases": ["HIST-309"]}
