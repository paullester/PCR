{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1902"}, "description": "On one level Chicano History is the history of Mexican-origin peoples in the United States since 1848. But Chicano also refers to the emergence of a specific historical identity grounded in the protest movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Both definitions are part of the project of this course. We will survey the histories of the many Mexican American people who might (or might not) consider themselves Chicano ? from the Mexican American War to the Zoot Suit Riots, from El Plan Espiritual de Aztl?n to Selena. The class will also explore issues of ethnicity, immigration past and present, class and gender differences, cultural conflict and exchange, transnational economies and identities, popular cultural images and production, family life and community building, struggles for equality, the relationship of Mexican Americans to Latino/as, and the controversies raised by the emergence of an increasingly multi-ethnic, multilingual society. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "CHICANO HISTY OF THE US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3082/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "CHICANO HISTY OF THE US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-136-401", "path": "/courses/3082/sections/401", "id": "3082-401", "aliases": ["HIST-136-401", "LTAM-136-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/3082/sections/401/reviews/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "first_name": "PHOEBE S", "last_name": "KROPP", "id": "641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "name": "PHOEBE S KROPP"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "3082-401-641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-136", "path": "/courses/3082", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3082/sections", "values": [{"name": "CHICANO HISTY OF THE US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-136-401", "path": "/courses/3082/sections/401", "id": "3082-401", "aliases": ["HIST-136-401", "LTAM-136-401"]}]}, "id": 3082, "aliases": ["HIST-136", "LTAM-136"]}
