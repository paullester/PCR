Readings include fictional as well as analytical representations, and a film series will accompany the course.\r\n\r\nAll students surveyed reported learning a lot from this course while enjoying the semester.

Many students describe the course as \u201cgreat\u201d and enjoyed how much they learned, which one student described as an \u201camazing\u201d amount of information.

A few describe the class as \u201ceasy\u201d noting that \u201c[t]here isn\u2019t too much extra work required.\u201d The course allows students to select four essays to write throughout the semester, which students found helpful because they could select essays that fit into their schedules and particular interests.
