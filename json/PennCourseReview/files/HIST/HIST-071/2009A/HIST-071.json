It examines the legacy of Spanish colonialism and slavery, movements for national and cultural independence, twentieth-century radicalism, and the politics of race in contemporary Latin America. Readings include fictional as well as analytical representations, and a film series.\r\n\r\nMost students--many interested in Latin American history--were only moderately satisfied by this course. As one student put it, \u201cIt is supposed to do the impossible task of covering 2 centuries of history of an entire region.\u201d Several students mentioned that they left class more confused than when they came in. \u201cI feel like I\\'m well-read on a small handful of events in Latin America,\u201d another student wrote, \u201cBut I don\\'t really have a sense of the history of the region holistically.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Farnsworth-Alvear was described as \u201cwonderfully entertaining\u201d and someone who \u201cclearly really knows her Latin American history.\u201d However some said her familiarity with the subject matter was a hindrance to some extent. \u201cIt is her brilliance that made it impossible for me and many other students to get anything out of this course,\u201d one student wrote. Her tendency to speak too fast during lecture was also troubling to many students in this course.\r\n\r\nThe class consisted of a mix of history majors as well as other students. One history major was displeased with the construction of assignments, since \u201cthey seemed dumbed down.\u201d Other students did appreciate the creativity of their paper topics.", "num_students": 71, "path": "/courses/15889/sections/401/reviews/1511-ANN-C--FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1511-ANN-C--FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR", "first_name": "ANN C.", "last_name": "FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR", "id": "1511-ANN-C--FARNSWORTH-ALVEAR", "name": "ANN C.
