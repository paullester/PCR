{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1907"}, "description": "This course will trace the history of the American South from the end of the Civil War to the present. It will investigate Reconstruction, the New South, Populism, racial disfranchisement and the rise of Jim Crow, the politics of the One-Party South, the South in the Progressive era and its role in the New Deal and World War II, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and the rise of the Republican South. While following the narrative of politics and economic development,we will pay particular attention to race relations and will be more than casually interested in gender roles. In addition, we will take frequent peeks at the evolving Southern identity as reflected in popular culture and literature as well as in other corners of the public sphere. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "LECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3088/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.16", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "3.46", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39", "rReadingsValue": "2.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.36", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.66"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-171-001", "path": "/courses/3088/sections/001", "id": "3088-001", "aliases": ["HIST-171-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 98, "path": "/courses/3088/sections/001/reviews/653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY", "first_name": "FRANCIS SHELDON", "last_name": "HACKNEY", "id": "653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY", "name": "FRANCIS SHELDON HACKNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 56, "id": "3088-001-653-FRANCIS-SHELDON-HACKNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-171", "path": "/courses/3088", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3088/sections", "values": [{"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-171-001", "path": "/courses/3088/sections/001", "id": "3088-001", "aliases": ["HIST-171-001"]}]}, "id": 3088, "aliases": ["HIST-171"]}
