{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5547"}, "description": "Ideas play an intangible role in defining culture and politics. In the contemporary Middle East, mass movements and revolutions have become a familiar feature of social and political life. This course surveys some of the major revolutions and ideologies that have caused significant change in the Middle East over the last century. We will examine icons of imperialism and consider varying sources of conflict within and between states. Novels, essays, and secondary works will comprise the bulk of the readings. The weekly assignments will focus on particular themes or on works that show the nature of political change in various contexts and geographic settings. Thematic texts will be supplemented with some factual information to help the students put the ideas of revolt and protest in the proper historical context. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "Mass Movements & Contemporary Politics in Mid East & N Africa", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29089/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.36"}, "section": {"name": "Mass Movements & Contemporary Politics in Mid East & N Africa", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-188-401", "path": "/courses/29089/sections/401", "id": "29089-401", "aliases": ["HIST-188-401", "NELC-188-401", "SOCI-231-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/29089/sections/401/reviews/617-FIROOZEH-KASHANI-SABET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/617-FIROOZEH-KASHANI-SABET", "first_name": "FIROOZEH", "last_name": "KASHANI-SABET", "id": "617-FIROOZEH-KASHANI-SABET", "name": "FIROOZEH KASHANI-SABET"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "29089-401-617-FIROOZEH-KASHANI-SABET"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-188", "path": "/courses/29089", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29089/sections", "values": [{"name": "Mass Movements & Contemporary Politics in Mid East & N Africa", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-188-401", "path": "/courses/29089/sections/401", "id": "29089-401", "aliases": ["HIST-188-401", "NELC-188-401", "SOCI-231-401"]}]}, "id": 29089, "aliases": ["HIST-188", "NELC-188", "SOCI-231"]}
