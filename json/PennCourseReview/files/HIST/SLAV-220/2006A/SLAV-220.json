{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3244"}, "description": "The course is a one-semester survey of literary, philosophical, political and socio-religious issues in Ukraine from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 21st century. Its goal is to introduce students to an understanding of individual and collective thought in Ukrainian history and enable them to determine Ukraine's role in the making of contemporary Europe. Interdisciplinary in nature and comparative in methodology, the survey focuses on the principal works of imaginative literature and philosophical writings. \n\nFollowing a theoretical and historical introduction and placing the subject matter within the European context, selected works of Ukrainian classicism and romanticism will be analyzed and interpreted as roots of modern Ukrainian identity. An attempt will be made to point out the elective affinities of Ukrainian intellectuals with their European counterparts and to demonstrate the organic unity of Ukraine's culture with that of Western Europe. The survey will conclude with an analysis of post-modernistic intellectual currents and intellectual life in Ukraine following the Orange Revolution of 2004/05. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "Poets, Priests and Politicians: An Intellectual History of Modern Ukraine", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8348/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "Poets, Priests and Politicians: An Intellectual History of Modern Ukraine", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "SLAV-220-601", "path": "/courses/8348/sections/601", "id": "8348-601", "aliases": ["SLAV-220-601", "HIST-218-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/8348/sections/601/reviews/2683-LEO-D--RUDNYTZKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2683-LEO-D--RUDNYTZKY", "first_name": "LEO D.", "last_name": "RUDNYTZKY", "id": "2683-LEO-D--RUDNYTZKY", "name": "LEO D.
