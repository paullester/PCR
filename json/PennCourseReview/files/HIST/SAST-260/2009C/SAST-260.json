{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4125"}, "description": "This course is designed as an introduction to the contemporary history of Afghanistan and Pakistan, with an emphasis on the intertwined history of both countries; their other regional neighbors; and global politics. The course focuses on global trends such as empire, nationalism, the Cold War, superpower competition, and transnational Islamism. At the same time, participants will explore how local people viewed their lives amidst these trends, and how local dynamics on this northwestern fringe of the Subcontinent changed the face of global politics. The readings supplement political and economic history with primary sources drawn from popular poetry, oral narrative, and memoir. Finally, we'll be following current events in the region, and placing them in their sociohistorical context. Therefore, there are two main goals for this course: (1) to introduce the specific history of Afghanistan and Pakistan up to present, and (2) to introduce typologies of social institutions and events, assisting class participants to develop their own frameworks for interpreting current events in the region after the end of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "MDRN HIST AFGHAN/PKSTN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18050/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "MDRN HIST AFGHAN/PKSTN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-260-401", "path": "/courses/18050/sections/401", "id": "18050-401", "aliases": ["SAST-260-401", "HIST-384-401", "SAST-560-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/18050/sections/401/reviews/4974-JAMES-CARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4974-JAMES-CARON", "first_name": "JAMES", "last_name": "CARON", "id": "4974-JAMES-CARON", "name": "JAMES CARON"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "18050-401-4974-JAMES-CARON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-260", "path": "/courses/18050", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18050/sections", "values": [{"name": "MDRN HIST AFGHAN/PKSTN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-260-401", "path": "/courses/18050/sections/401", "id": "18050-401", "aliases": ["SAST-260-401", "HIST-384-401", "SAST-560-401"]}]}, "id": 18050, "aliases": ["SAST-260", "HIST-384", "SAST-560"]}
