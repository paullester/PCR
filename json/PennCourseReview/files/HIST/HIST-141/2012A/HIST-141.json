However, a number of students felt that the course was \u201ctoo broad\u201d and that it would have been nice for it to have been \u201cnarrowed down to focus on certain topics.\u201d  A couple of students appreciated being assigned source materials instead of secondary sources as they were \u201cvery valuable in grasping the material,\u201d but wished there could have been recitation sections where they would \u201cbe able to discuss certain issues and themes.\u201d \r\n\r\n\tStudents liked Professor Wenger, finding her \u201cpassion for the course content obvious.\u201d  One student found that Professor Wenger \u201cgave very useful feedback when discussing essays or course material,\u201d and said Professor Wenger had the \u201cability to communicate the subject so fluidly.\u201d  Still, one student commented that Professor Wenger \u201ccould have done a better job engaging students vis-\u00e0-vis multimedia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tThis course fulfills History and Tradition and Cross-Cultural Analysis for College students.  Students found the work for this course to be \u201cmanageable,\u201d with \u201ctwo papers, one midterm, and a final,\u201d but at least one student stated that there was so much material that \u201cabsorbing the content and keeping up with the readings seemed difficult.\u201d  Though it is a Jewish history course, one student commented that \u201cthe course would also be stimulating for non-Jews.\u201d", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/27564/sections/401/reviews/1488-BETH-S--WENGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1488-BETH-S--WENGER", "first_name": "BETH S.", "last_name": "WENGER", "id": "1488-BETH-S--WENGER", "name": "BETH S.
