{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3913"}, "description": "This is the second half of the Near East sequence. This course surveys Islamic civilization from circa 600 (the rise of Islam) to the start of the modern era and concentrates on political, social, and cultural trends. Although the emphasis will be on Middle Eastern societies, we will occasionally consider developments in other parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and Spain, where Islamic civilization was or has been influential. Our goal is to understand the shared features that have distinguished Islamic civilization as well as the varieties of experience that have endowed it with so much diversity. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTRO TO MIDDLE EAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13622/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "2.05", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.05", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.95", "rCommAbility": "3.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO MIDDLE EAST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NELC-102-001", "path": "/courses/13622/sections/001", "id": "13622-001", "aliases": ["NELC-102-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/13622/sections/001/reviews/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "first_name": "HEATHER", "last_name": "SHARKEY", "id": "1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "name": "HEATHER SHARKEY"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "13622-001-1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-102", "path": "/courses/13622", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13622/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO MIDDLE EAST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NELC-102-001", "path": "/courses/13622/sections/001", "id": "13622-001", "aliases": ["NELC-102-001"]}]}, "id": 13622, "aliases": ["NELC-102"]}
