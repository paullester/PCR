Although the emphasis is on Middle Eastern societies, this course occasionally considers developments in other parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and Spain, where Middle Eastern cultures are or have been influential. The goal of this course is to understand the shared features that have distinguished Middle Eastern societies under the aegis of Islamic civilization, as well as the varieties of experience that have endowed the region with so much cultural diversity. The course leads up to the present in order to understand the political and social strains that are affecting the Middle East today. &#8232;&#8232;Overall, students loved this course.
