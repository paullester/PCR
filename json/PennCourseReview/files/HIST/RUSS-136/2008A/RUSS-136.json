{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4114"}, "description": "This course covers 19C Russian cultural and social history. Each week-long unit is organized around a single medium-length text (novella, play, memoir) which opens up a single scene of social historybirth, death, duel, courtship, tsar, and so on. Each of these main texts is accompanied by a set of supplementary materialspaintings, historical readings, cultural-analytical readings, excerpts from other literary works, etc. The object of the course is to understand the social codes and rituals that informed nineteenth-century Russian life, and to apply this knowledge in interpreting literary texts, other cultural objects, and even historical and social documents (letters, memoranda, etc.). We will attempt to understand social history and literary interpretation as separate disciplinesyet also as disciplines that can inform one another. In short: we will read the social history through the text, and read the text against the social history. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "Portraits of Russian Society: Art, Fiction, Drama", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20795/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.46", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "3.32", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.39", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "Portraits of Russian Society: Art, Fiction, Drama", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-136-401", "path": "/courses/20795/sections/401", "id": "20795-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-136-401", "HIST-047-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/20795/sections/401/reviews/1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "first_name": "KEVIN M.F.", "last_name": "PLATT", "id": "1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "name": "KEVIN M.F.
