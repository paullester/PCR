{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4057"}, "description": "In this seminar we will study modern genocide with an emphasis on the causes of genocidal processes, possible preventative measures, and social healing after the fact. Particular focus will be on the Holocaust, Rwanda, Bosnia- Herzegovina and Darfur, but other cases will also be examined, including the Herero and Armenian genocides, the genocide of Iraqi Kurds, Guatemala and Cambodia. Using scholarly texts, fiction, film and other media, we will discuss the definition of genocide and its representation, the long- and short-term historical contexts that enable genocide, the question of the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the value of comparative genocide studies,the problem of international response, and the relationship between genocide and other forms of social and political violence. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "COMP HISTORY OF GENOCIDE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23242/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.15", "rCommAbility": "3.77", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "COMP HISTORY OF GENOCIDE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HIST-474-601", "path": "/courses/23242/sections/601", "id": "23242-601", "aliases": ["HIST-474-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/23242/sections/601/reviews/609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "first_name": "ELISA", "last_name": "VON JOEDEN-FORGEY", "id": "609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "name": "ELISA VON JOEDEN-FORGEY"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "23242-601-609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-474", "path": "/courses/23242", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23242/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP HISTORY OF GENOCIDE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HIST-474-601", "path": "/courses/23242/sections/601", "id": "23242-601", "aliases": ["HIST-474-601"]}]}, "id": 23242, "aliases": ["HIST-474"]}
