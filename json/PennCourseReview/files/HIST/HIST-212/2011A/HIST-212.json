The focus of our discussion will be analytic and comparative. We'll be interested in what views an author holds of human nature and possibility, of society, of motivation, of ethics, of history, and so on. \"Classical Liberal Thought\" is, in briefest form, a belief in minimal government and maximal individual rights and choice, consistent with peace and order. The function of our discussion will be to analyze individual thinkers, and, as we read past our first, to compare our thinkers, looking both for agreements and, above all, disagreements. &#8232;&#8232;Students thoroughly enjoyed this course. They described the class as \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d. One student in particular described the course as a \u201cwonderful, educational, experience\u201d. Many students commented on how enjoyable they found the reading. &#8232;&#8232;Students raved about Professor Kors. One student said he \u201cclearly cares a great deal about student learning\u201d. Others noted his great quality of stimulating lively discussion. Several students said he was the best professor they\u2019ve had at Penn. &#8232;&#8232;This course was a Ben Franklin Seminar.
