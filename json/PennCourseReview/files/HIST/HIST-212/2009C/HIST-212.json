They appreciated the engaging lectures and interesting subject matter, but many emphasized that there was a lot of reading required. One student noted that \u201cthe reading (most of it spectacular) took over 50% of all the time I devoted to academics this semester,\u201d but he added that, \u201cI do not regret it since I had the opportunity to read astonishing material and to participate in a seminar with such high quality of students.\u201d Reviews mentioned that students should be prepared to think critically about the reading but that \u201cyou come away having extracted knowledge for life.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents really appreciate Professor Kors\u2019s in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.
