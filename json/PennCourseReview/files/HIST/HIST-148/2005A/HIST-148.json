Some of the topics covered include: mass consumption and leisure, the Great Depression, the rise of fascism, changing social relations between the sexes and the impact of technology on work and everyday life. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "THE GREAT WAR & SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10531/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-148", "path": "/courses/10531", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10531/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE GREAT WAR & SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HIST-148-601", "path": "/courses/10531/sections/601", "id": "10531-601", "aliases": ["HIST-148-601"]}]}, "id": 10531, "aliases": ["HIST-148"]}
