{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2593"}, "description": "This course explores the use of film as a medium for interpreting the past, using American, Soviet and European films of the 1920s and 30s. Feature films, documentaries and avant-garde films will be viewed and discussed as both expressions and reflections of the interwar years, a period fraught with political, economic and cultural tensions. Some of the topics covered include: mass consumption and leisure, the Great Depression, the rise of fascism, changing social relations between the sexes and the impact of technology on work and everyday life. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "WW I: STATE AND SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5437/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.55", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.65", "rCourseQuality": "3.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.40", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "WW I: STATE AND SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-148-001", "path": "/courses/5437/sections/001", "id": "5437-001", "aliases": ["HIST-148-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/5437/sections/001/reviews/609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "first_name": "ELISA", "last_name": "VON JOEDEN-FORGEY", "id": "609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY", "name": "ELISA VON JOEDEN-FORGEY"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "5437-001-609-ELISA-VON-JOEDEN-FORGEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-148", "path": "/courses/5437", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5437/sections", "values": [{"name": "WW I: STATE AND SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-148-001", "path": "/courses/5437/sections/001", "id": "5437-001", "aliases": ["HIST-148-001"]}]}, "id": 5437, "aliases": ["HIST-148"]}
