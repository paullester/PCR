{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3751"}, "description": "Beginning with Christopher Columbus' eager description of them as \"Indians\"m to the Spanish monarchs, the native inhabitants of the Americas have beennta- the subject of representations that often reveal more about outsiders thanome about indigenous people themselves. In this course we look at how outsiders have characterized some of the indigenous groups of North, Central and South America, from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. We will compare various strategies of conquest and control devised by English, Spanish and other European conquerors and their later counterparts. Using historical and anthropological sources as well as literature, film and other visual depictions, we will analyze some of the legal, ontological, moral and philosophical frameworks devised to describe and categorize Indians. We will examine the present-day legacies of cultural differences among indigenous people as well as among their conquerors, and attend to the ways Indians have used new technologies and strategies to represent themselves. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "Religion and Society in Early Modern Iberian World", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11963/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "Religion and Society in Early Modern Iberian World", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-313-401", "path": "/courses/11963/sections/401", "id": "11963-401", "aliases": ["HIST-313-401", "RELS-313-401", "LTAM-313-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/11963/sections/401/reviews/2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "first_name": "ANTONIO", "last_name": "FEROS", "id": "2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "name": "ANTONIO FEROS"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "11963-401-2775-ANTONIO-FEROS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-313", "path": "/courses/11963", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11963/sections", "values": [{"name": "Religion and Society in Early Modern Iberian World", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-313-401", "path": "/courses/11963/sections/401", "id": "11963-401", "aliases": ["HIST-313-401", "RELS-313-401", "LTAM-313-401"]}]}, "id": 11963, "aliases": ["HIST-313", "RELS-313", "LTAM-313"]}
