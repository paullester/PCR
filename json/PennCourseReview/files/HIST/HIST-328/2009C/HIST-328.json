This course will examine the cold War as a global phenomenon, covering not only the military and diplomatic history of the period, but also examining the social and cultural impact of the superpower confrontation. We will cover the origins of the conflict, the interplay between periods of tension and detente, the relative significance of disagreements within the opposing blocs, and the relationship between the \"center\" of the conflict in the North Atlantic/European area and the global \"periphery\". \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "COLD WAR: AN INTRNL HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17513/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.94", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.51"}, "section": {"name": "COLD WAR: AN INTRNL HIST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-328-001", "path": "/courses/17513/sections/001", "id": "17513-001", "aliases": ["HIST-328-001"]}, "comments": "This course examines the Cold War as a global phenomenon, covering not only the military and diplomatic history of the period, but the social and cultural impact of the superpower confrontation, from both the Western and Eastern perspectives.
