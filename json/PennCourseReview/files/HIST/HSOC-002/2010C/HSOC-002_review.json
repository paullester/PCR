The course takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient, the physician, and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to \"treat\" healthy people as well as the sick. Rather than history \"from the \u201ctop down\" or \"from the \u201cbottom up,\u201d this course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means, first, that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. Required readings consist largely of primary sources, from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments encourage students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents raved about the course. They thought that the lectures were interesting and that the course \u201creally took advantage of Philadelphia\u2019s rich medical history,\u201d and that the interesting readings complemented the lectures.
