{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/581"}, "description": "This course, designed for first and second year students, continues the history of modern Europe from the high point of Empire and world domination at the end of the nineteenth century to collapse and ruin in 1945. The grand societies and rich states which composed the European state system in 1890 destroyed themselves in these fifty-five years. As many as eighty million Russians, Germans, Poles, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Italians and other Europeans died in slavelabor camps, and six million Jews were systematically murdered. Europe's flourishing Jewish community east of the Rhine was wiped out. On the 9th of May 1945, the day Nazi Germany surrended, the once prosperous continent was a smoking ruin, covered by rubble, pock-marked by craters and full of miserable starving people. This course will try to explain how and why Europe committed suicide in such a horrific way. It will cover Fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, the two world wars, the great economic depression and the Holocaust. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "EUROPE: 1890-1945", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9050/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.03", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "3.03", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.59", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "EUROPE: 1890-1945", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-127-001", "path": "/courses/9050/sections/001", "id": "9050-001", "aliases": ["HIST-127-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 109, "path": "/courses/9050/sections/001/reviews/625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "STEINBERG", "id": "625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG", "name": "JONATHAN STEINBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 78, "id": "9050-001-625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-127", "path": "/courses/9050", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9050/sections", "values": [{"name": "EUROPE: 1890-1945", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-127-001", "path": "/courses/9050/sections/001", "id": "9050-001", "aliases": ["HIST-127-001"]}]}, "id": 9050, "aliases": ["HIST-127"]}
