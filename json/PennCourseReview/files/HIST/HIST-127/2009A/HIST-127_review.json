The grand societies and rich states which composed the European state system in 1890 destroyed themselves in these fifty-five years. As many as eighty million Russians, Germans, Poles, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Italians and other Europeans died in slave- labor camps, and six million Jews were systematically murdered. Europe\\'s flourishing Jewish community east of the Rhine was wiped out. On the 9th of May 1945, the day Nazi Germany surrendered, the once prosperous continent was a smoking ruin, covered by rubble, pock-marked by craters and full of miserable starving people. This course will try to explain how and why Europe committed suicide in such a horrific way. It will cover Fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, the two world wars, the great economic depression, and the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course material \u201cstraight-forward, yet still quite interesting.\u201d They also appreciated the \u201cfantastic primary readings\u201d which \u201cdid a lot to deepen\u2026 understanding of the issues discussed during lecture.\u201d The amount learned from this course was above average.\r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Mercer to be a \u201cgreat professor\u201d and a \u201ctop-tier lecturer,\u201d able to communicate \u201ca tremendous amount of course material in a short bi-weekly lecture class.\u201d One student appreciated that he took the time to write extensive comments on essays and found him to be very accessible.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of this course was relatively low. The work consisted of readings and essays. This course was recommended fairly strongly to majors and recommended, but less strongly, to non-majors.", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/15896/sections/001/reviews/4182-BEN-MERCER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4182-BEN-MERCER", "first_name": "BEN", "last_name": "MERCER", "id": "4182-BEN-MERCER", "name": "BEN MERCER"}, "num_reviewers": 56, "id": "15896-001-4182-BEN-MERCER"}]
