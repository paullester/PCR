The First World War put an end to the world of the nineteenth century and laid the foundations of the twentieth century, the age of destruction and devastation. This course examines the war in three components: the long-term and immediate causes of the First World War; the war's catastrophic conduct, on the battlefield and on the home front; and, the war's devastating aftermath. While  military operations and certain battles will be discussed, this course is not a military history of the war; it covers the social, economic, political and diplomatic aspects that contributed to the war's outbreak and made possible its execution over four devastating years. No preliminary knowledge or coursework is required.\r\n\r\nStudents agreed that this course was \u201cexcellent\u201d and one of the \u201cbest courses\u201d at Penn.
