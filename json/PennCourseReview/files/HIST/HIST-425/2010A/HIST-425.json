{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4821"}, "description": "This survey course examines the outbreak, conduct, and aftermath of the First World War. The First World War put an end to the world of the 19th century and laid the foundations of the 20th century, the age of destruction and devastation. This course will examine the war in three components: the long-term and immediate causes of the First World War; the war's catastrophic conduct, on the battlefield and on the home front; and the war's devastating aftermath. While we will discuss military operations and certain battles, this course is not a military history of the war; it covers the social, economic, political and diplomatic aspects that contributed to the war's outbreak and made possible its execution over four devastating years. No preliminary knowledge or coursework is required. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "WORLD WAR I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26220/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "3.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD WAR I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-425-001", "path": "/courses/26220/sections/001", "id": "26220-001", "aliases": ["HIST-425-001"]}, "comments": "This survey course examines the outbreak, conduct, and aftermath of the First World War.

I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better. It makes me wish I was a history major.\u201d Students also liked the structure of the course which \u201canalyzed the major players [in the war] separately, then the causes, and then much later in the course, the actual war.\u201d Students said this format \u201cmade the countries\u2019 actions make sense.\u201d\r\n\tStudents raved about Professor Holquist. They called him \u201cthe most engaging lecturer I\u2019ve had at Penn,\u201d \u201cpassionate,\u201d and said \u201chis enthusiasm for the subject is infectious.\u201d One student wrote, \u201cProfessor Holquist was very accessible and accommodating throughout the semester.
