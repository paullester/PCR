{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4821"}, "description": "This survey course examines the outbreak, conduct, and aftermath of the First World War. The First World War put an end to the world of the 19th century and laid the foundations of the 20th century, the age of destruction and devastation. This course will examine the war in three components: the long-term and immediate causes of the First World War; the war's catastrophic conduct, on the battlefield and on the home front; and the war's devastating aftermath. While we will discuss military operations and certain battles, this course is not a military history of the war; it covers the social, economic, political and diplomatic aspects that contributed to the war's outbreak and made possible its execution over four devastating years. No preliminary knowledge or coursework is required. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "WORLD WAR I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29104/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.14", "rTAQuality": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.70", "rWorkRequired": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.91", "rCommAbility": "3.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD WAR I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-425-001", "path": "/courses/29104/sections/001", "id": "29104-001", "aliases": ["HIST-425-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/29104/sections/001/reviews/3325-PETER-HOLQUIST", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3325-PETER-HOLQUIST", "first_name": "PETER", "last_name": "HOLQUIST", "id": "3325-PETER-HOLQUIST", "name": "PETER HOLQUIST"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "29104-001-3325-PETER-HOLQUIST"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-425", "path": "/courses/29104", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29104/sections", "values": [{"name": "WORLD WAR I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-425-001", "path": "/courses/29104/sections/001", "id": "29104-001", "aliases": ["HIST-425-001"]}]}, "id": 29104, "aliases": ["HIST-425"]}
