Readings included Diderot, Nietzsche and Montaigne, among others. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;In general, students \u201cenjoyed\u201d this course, which they described as \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cwell structured,\u201d and \u201cvery good.\u201d Students reported that the course remained \u201cstimulating\u201d despite being \u201cextremely factually based\u201d and covering a \u201ctremendous amount\u201d of material. It was able to cover an expansive historical time period yet still be \u201cbrilliantly detailed.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Most students really enjoyed Professor Safley\u2019s teaching style, and several students described him as an \u201cexcellent lecturer and teacher.\u201d Students found Professor Safley to be \u201cpassionate\u201d about the subject and a \u201cgifted\u201d communicator of the material. Students commended him for being able to communicate a vast amount of subject matter and still \u201cmake [students] feel that [they] are getting the details\u201d and make it \u201ccomprehensible to the students.\u201d Professor Safley\u2019s lectures were described as \u201corganized\u201d and \u201cwell thought out.\u201d It was clear to students that he cared about and enjoyed teaching them, and he was described as \u201capproachable.\u201d One student noted that it was frustrating that Professor Safley was not personally responsible for any of the grading, so it was difficult to approach him with questions about how to improve one\u2019s grade in the course.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students\u2019 chief complaint about this course was the excessive amount of assigned weekly reading, with students often expected to read an entire book over the course of one week. Students often felt like they had to \u201ccram\u201d complex books, which they felt led to mere \u201cscratch-the-surface\u201d recitation discussions afterwards and made it difficult to retain the books\u2019 content. One student mentioned that tests asked students to \u201cregurgitate facts instead of analyzing events\u201d and a couple of students reported that grading seemed \u201carbitrary.\u201d Participation in class is factored into students\u2019 grades, and a student who does not participate receives the same grade as a student who is absent.
