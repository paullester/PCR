Students appreciated the \u201cbreadth of knowledge\u201d he brought to each class, but many pointed out that \u201chis ability to communicate the subject matter was not very good.\u201d As this course lasted for three hours, students wished Professor McGann was less \u201cdisorganized\u201d and could focus his knowledge more effectively to help students.\r\n\r\n\tMany students complained about the difficulty of the course compared to the information learned, with one saying \u201cmy grades probably don\u2019t reflect my knowledge.\u201d Tests were said to include information not covered in class, \u201cwhich made them difficult,\u201d and some felt that because this was \u201cmore difficult than an introductory course,\u201d those without an IR background could face difficulty.
