{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/614"}, "description": "Who ARE the Americans, anyway? And are they still what they once were? The course will consider some classic and modern theories of American identity. It will address some allegedly quintessential expressions of this elusive, perhaps essential idea, in Puritanism, Jefferson, Franklin, and Whitman. And it will examine contemporary West Philadelphia to see if the old characterizations still apply in a new day (or ever did apply outside small-town American among affluent white males). Work in, and observation of, a local school will be an integral part of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "AMER NATIONAL CHARACTER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6696/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.21", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "AMER NATIONAL CHARACTER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-443-001", "path": "/courses/6696/sections/001", "id": "6696-001", "aliases": ["HIST-443-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/6696/sections/001/reviews/652-MICHAEL-W--ZUCKERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/652-MICHAEL-W--ZUCKERMAN", "first_name": "MICHAEL W.", "last_name": "ZUCKERMAN", "id": "652-MICHAEL-W--ZUCKERMAN", "name": "MICHAEL W.
