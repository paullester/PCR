{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3501"}, "description": "Many historians have argued that the most successful type of religious life in the Christian tradition is that founded by Saint Benedict of Nursia in early medieval Italy. The vision of a devout life in community dominated the medieval Christian landscape, and inspired some of the greatest classics of western Christian spirituality. This course will trace he Benedictine ideal from its roots in the Desert Fathers of the early Church, through Benedict's life and the formation of his Rule, to he role played by Benedictines in the development of medieval secular learning, theology, music, and spirituality. We will end by reading some contemporary works on the Benedictine ideal in the modern world. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "MEDIEVAL CHURCH HISTORY: BIBLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25067/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "3.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.14", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "MEDIEVAL CHURCH HISTORY: BIBLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-533-401", "path": "/courses/25067/sections/401", "id": "25067-401", "aliases": ["RELS-533-401", "HIST-533-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/25067/sections/401/reviews/1048-E-ANN-MATTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1048-E-ANN-MATTER", "first_name": "E ANN", "last_name": "MATTER", "id": "1048-E-ANN-MATTER", "name": "E ANN MATTER"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "25067-401-1048-E-ANN-MATTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-533", "path": "/courses/25067", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25067/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDIEVAL CHURCH HISTORY: BIBLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-533-401", "path": "/courses/25067/sections/401", "id": "25067-401", "aliases": ["RELS-533-401", "HIST-533-401"]}]}, "id": 25067, "aliases": ["RELS-533", "HIST-533"]}
