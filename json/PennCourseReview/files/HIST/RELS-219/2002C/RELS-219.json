The seminar focuses on the holy city of Jerusalem, exploring the events leading to its demise in 70 CE at Roman hands and its fate in the centuries that followed. We will examine the complex history and symbolic legacy of the city in the Jewish and Christian imaginations--from the formative period of early Christianity when Jerusalem was at the forefront of contention between the two groups, to the relative demise of attention to the city in Jewish and Christian thought during the 2nd and 3rd centuries under pagan Roman rule, to the revival of interest in the 4th century under Roman Emperor Constantine, with the appropriation of Jerusalem as a Christian city in a Christian world. Following the fascinating transmutations in the history of the holy city, this course explores the exchange of ideas between adherents of both Judaism and Christianity in this ancient cradle of their pasts. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "JEWISH/CHRIST RELATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3458/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.11", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.56", "rCourseQuality": "2.41", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.61", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "JEWISH/CHRIST RELATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-219-401", "path": "/courses/3458/sections/401", "id": "3458-401", "aliases": ["RELS-219-401", "JWST-219-401", "HIST-219-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/3458/sections/401/reviews/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "first_name": "TALYA", "last_name": "FISHMAN", "id": "1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "name": "TALYA FISHMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "3458-401-1057-TALYA-FISHMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-219", "path": "/courses/3458", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3458/sections", "values": [{"name": "JEWISH/CHRIST RELATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-219-401", "path": "/courses/3458/sections/401", "id": "3458-401", "aliases": ["RELS-219-401", "JWST-219-401", "HIST-219-401"]}]}, "id": 3458, "aliases": ["RELS-219", "JWST-219", "HIST-219"]}
