{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2312"}, "description": "This course surveys Native American life east of the Mississippi River from earliest times to the present. The diverse histories of Native peoples will be examined both on their own terms and as continuing elements of the continent's broader story. Topics to be addressed include 16th- and 17th-century demographic, economic, and social consequences of contact with European peoples, 18th century strategies of resistance and accommodation to colonial powers, 19th-century impacts of U.S. government removal and cultural assimilation policies, and 20th-century cultural and political developments among the region's surviving Native American communities. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "NATIV PEOP OF EAS N.AMER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5442/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.87", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "NATIV PEOP OF EAS N.AMER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-172-001", "path": "/courses/5442/sections/001", "id": "5442-001", "aliases": ["HIST-172-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/5442/sections/001/reviews/1512-DANIEL-K--RICHTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1512-DANIEL-K--RICHTER", "first_name": "DANIEL K.", "last_name": "RICHTER", "id": "1512-DANIEL-K--RICHTER", "name": "DANIEL K.
