Topics discussed include the causes and course of the Civil War, Reconstruction, politics in the Gilded Age, late nineteenth-century urbanization and immigration, Populism, Progressivism, the sociology and politics of the twenties, the New Deal, post-World War II America, the turbulence of the sixties, and contemporary affairs.\r\n\r\nMany students felt that it was a \u201cgreat class\u201d that was \u201cvery interesting and stimulating.\u201d One student said that, \u201cthe class was amazing, before taking the course I despised history but now I feel able to analyze and appreciate history more because of the issues addressed.\u201d However, others were frustrated. The main point of contention was the subject matter. Many students found the course title misleading and felt that the class dealt more with cultural history than traditional history. Some yearned for a more \u201ctraditional\u201d approach and others felt the class overlooked \u201cpolitical, socioeconomic, and race details crucial to the depiction of history.\u201d Students appreciated the analytical skills they gained in the class though some felt there was a lot of reading.\r\n\r\nMost of the students praised Professor Kropp as \u201cinteresting and engaging\u201d as well as \u201corganized and clear.\u201d They applauded the variety of techniques she used in lecture, from music to movies and video clips. Students felt these mediums helped them identify with the periods discussed and brought the history to life. However, other students found Professor Kropp\u2019s lectures to be \u201cboring\u201d at times. One student felt her lectures were \u201coften labored, awkward, and uninteresting.\u201d Another student claimed that Professor Kropp never responded to his e-mail.\r\n\r\nThis course is an introductory course. Students who usually did not like history thoroughly enjoyed the course, while others who claimed they \u201cloved\u201d US History were not satisfied. Some students felt some of the readings were not relevant and that there was a lot of reading. This course fulfils the history and tradition sector requirement and a regional requirement for the history major.", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/20307/sections/001/reviews/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "first_name": "PHOEBE S", "last_name": "KROPP", "id": "641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "name": "PHOEBE S KROPP"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "20307-001-641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP"}]
