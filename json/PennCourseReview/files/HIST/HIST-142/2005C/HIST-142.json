{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3749"}, "description": "This course will be team-taught by specialists in each of the three onotheistic traditions, offering a comparative overview of the societies of European and Western Asia in the age of faith. Basic questions include the nature of religious communities, their theoretical and historical relations to political and societal structures and their intellectual and spiritual underpinnings. Readings, lectures, and discussions will be organized around a series of themes viewed from the perspective of each of the three traditions in the historical development including religious authority and law, forms of worship and personal piety, intellectual life and interconfessional attitudes and relations, illustrated by religious polemics and travel literature. The course represents an experiment in dialogue -- among three communities and faiths, among teachers and among students. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "WOMEN:US HIST, 1500-1865", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11950/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "2.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.77", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.31", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN:US HIST, 1500-1865", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-142-401", "path": "/courses/11950/sections/401", "id": "11950-401", "aliases": ["HIST-142-401", "WSTD-142-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/11950/sections/401/reviews/1509-KATHLEEN-M--BROWN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1509-KATHLEEN-M--BROWN", "first_name": "KATHLEEN M.", "last_name": "BROWN", "id": "1509-KATHLEEN-M--BROWN", "name": "KATHLEEN M.
