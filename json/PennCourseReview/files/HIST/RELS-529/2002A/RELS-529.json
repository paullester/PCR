{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/988"}, "description": "This \"bi-directional\" course explores the presence of the religious Other as it is refracted in Jewish literature of a particular time and place, and the presence of Jews and Judaism in contemporaneous non-Jewish writings, whether Hellenistic, Christian or Muslim. Attention will be paid to ways in which the belief systems and religious practices of the Other are perceived and portrayed, to internal policies regulating interactions with the Other, and to cross-cultural influences, whether or not these are acknowledged. Primary source readings will be available in English translation. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "\"OTHER\" PRE-MOD JUDAISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/988/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.63", "rDifficulty": "3.38", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "\"OTHER\" PRE-MOD JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "RELS-529-402", "path": "/courses/988/sections/402", "id": "988-402", "aliases": ["RELS-529-402", "JWST-529-402", "HIST-550-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/988/sections/402/reviews/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "first_name": "TALYA", "last_name": "FISHMAN", "id": "1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "name": "TALYA FISHMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "988-402-1057-TALYA-FISHMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-529", "path": "/courses/988", "sections": {"path": "/courses/988/sections", "values": [{"name": "\"OTHER\" PRE-MOD JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "RELS-529-402", "path": "/courses/988/sections/402", "id": "988-402", "aliases": ["RELS-529-402", "JWST-529-402", "HIST-550-402"]}]}, "id": 988, "aliases": ["RELS-529", "JWST-529", "HIST-550"]}
