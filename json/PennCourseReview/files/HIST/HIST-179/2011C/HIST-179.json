{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/589"}, "description": "This course will provide students with a solid knowledge of the history of early modern Spain (1450-1700). Through readings of primary and secondary texts that offer a complex vision of the cultural, religious, intellectual, and economic contexts and processes, students will be able to appreciate the intricacies of Spain's historical evolution. The course focuses on the rise and decline of the Spanish monarchy: the conditions that enabled Spain to become the most powerful monarchy in early modern times, and the conditions that led to its decline. This course also touches upon other important aspects critical to understanding early modern Spain: relationships among Christians, Muslims, and Jews in the Iberian Peninsula; the conquest and colonization of the New World; and early modern debates about Spain's rights to occupy America and the so-called \"destruction of the Indies.\" \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "RISE&FALL OF SPANISH EMP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24559/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.96", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.04", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.96", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "RISE&FALL OF SPANISH EMP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HIST-179-301", "path": "/courses/24559/sections/301", "id": "24559-301", "aliases": ["HIST-179-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/24559/sections/301/reviews/2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "first_name": "ANTONIO", "last_name": "FEROS", "id": "2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "name": "ANTONIO FEROS"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "24559-301-2775-ANTONIO-FEROS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-179", "path": "/courses/24559", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24559/sections", "values": [{"name": "RISE&FALL OF SPANISH EMP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HIST-179-301", "path": "/courses/24559/sections/301", "id": "24559-301", "aliases": ["HIST-179-301"]}]}, "id": 24559, "aliases": ["HIST-179"]}
