{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2695"}, "description": "Although most U.S. cities are no longer thought of as \"industrial cities,\" metropolitan areas today are all products of industrial economies, technologies, and social systems. This course explores the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization have shaped North American cities over the past two centuries. Major themes include economic geography, ecology, labor and production, suburbanization, outsourcing, energy, and cities' place in the world economy. The class will take regular walking tours of Philadelphia neighborhoods. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "INDUSTRIAL METROPOLIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18160/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.68", "rDifficulty": "2.68", "rStimulateInterest": "3.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "3.32", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.26", "rCommAbility": "3.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.84"}, "section": {"name": "INDUSTRIAL METROPOLIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-103-401", "path": "/courses/18160/sections/401", "id": "18160-401", "aliases": ["URBS-103-401", "HIST-209-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/18160/sections/401/reviews/2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "first_name": "DOMENIC", "last_name": "VITIELLO", "id": "2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "name": "DOMENIC VITIELLO"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "18160-401-2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-103", "path": "/courses/18160", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18160/sections", "values": [{"name": "INDUSTRIAL METROPOLIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-103-401", "path": "/courses/18160/sections/401", "id": "18160-401", "aliases": ["URBS-103-401", "HIST-209-401"]}]}, "id": 18160, "aliases": ["URBS-103", "HIST-209"]}
