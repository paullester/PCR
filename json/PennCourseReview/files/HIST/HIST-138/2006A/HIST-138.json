{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3113"}, "description": "The first half of this course looks at the development of trade, markets, and industry in Europe from the late Middle Ages until Adam Smith and the industrial revolution. The dynamic rise of European commerce and world-wide trade, changes in agricultural techniques and productivity, and finally, the growth of industrial trade, all modify our traditional vision of the industrial revolution. Rather than offering a detailed economic history of individual nations or regions, the course focuses on the causes of economic development in Europe and the interplay between commerce and social institutions across various time periods and countries. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "SECULAR JUDAISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7855/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.45", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.82", "rCommAbility": "3.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.91"}, "section": {"name": "SECULAR JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-138-401", "path": "/courses/7855/sections/401", "id": "7855-401", "aliases": ["HIST-138-401", "JWST-138-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/7855/sections/401/reviews/1189-MARION-KANT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1189-MARION-KANT", "first_name": "MARION", "last_name": "KANT", "id": "1189-MARION-KANT", "name": "MARION KANT"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "7855-401-1189-MARION-KANT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-138", "path": "/courses/7855", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7855/sections", "values": [{"name": "SECULAR JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-138-401", "path": "/courses/7855/sections/401", "id": "7855-401", "aliases": ["HIST-138-401", "JWST-138-401"]}]}, "id": 7855, "aliases": ["HIST-138", "JWST-138"]}
