From a subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of good, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part\u2014some would say the heart\u2014of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. \r\n\r\nMost students felt that although the course material was interesting, the course needed restructuring, as there was too much content that made lectures seem frantic and abstract. \r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Safley to be \u201cone of the best lecturers\u201d they have had, feeling that he knew how to engage and motivate students. Students thought that Professor Safley was willing to answer questions during and outside of class, although his lectures did not always integrate with the readings and could be disorganized.\r\n\r\nStudents found it difficult to master so much material and that the class required a lot of work. The class consists of two tests and two papers, and students found that Professor Safley did not grade leniently.", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/23212/sections/001/reviews/612-THOMAS-M--SAFLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/612-THOMAS-M--SAFLEY", "first_name": "THOMAS M.", "last_name": "SAFLEY", "id": "612-THOMAS-M--SAFLEY", "name": "THOMAS M.
