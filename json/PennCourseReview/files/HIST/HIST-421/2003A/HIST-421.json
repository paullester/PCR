{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/610"}, "description": "This course will examine the international politics of Europe in the 20th Century, the period during which Europe, beset by two devasting wars and the horrific experience of genocide, lost its dominant international position and was forced to adjust to a world dominated by extra-European forces. We wil examine the decline and (partial) recovery of Europe's international position with special attention to the contrast between international competition and transnational cooperation within Europe, the impact of the two World Wars, the ambivalent legacy of the Cold War, and Europe's developing role in the post-Cold War world. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "HIST OF INTER POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1779/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.82", "rDifficulty": "3.02", "rStimulateInterest": "2.17", "rRecommendMajor": "2.69", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "2.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.59"}, "section": {"name": "HIST OF INTER POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-421-001", "path": "/courses/1779/sections/001", "id": "1779-001", "aliases": ["HIST-421-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 65, "path": "/courses/1779/sections/001/reviews/636-JENNIFER-SIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/636-JENNIFER-SIEGEL", "first_name": "JENNIFER", "last_name": "SIEGEL", "id": "636-JENNIFER-SIEGEL", "name": "JENNIFER SIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 54, "id": "1779-001-636-JENNIFER-SIEGEL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-421", "path": "/courses/1779", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1779/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST OF INTER POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-421-001", "path": "/courses/1779/sections/001", "id": "1779-001", "aliases": ["HIST-421-001"]}]}, "id": 1779, "aliases": ["HIST-421"]}
