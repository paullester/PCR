Many liked that she was \u201cvery approachable\u201d and was always willing to meet with students, even attending certain recitations to better get to know students. Students all noted that she was very knowledgeable about the subject matter but had trouble organizing her lecture slides and \u201ccould work towards presenting the subject in a slightly more engaging way.\u201d Many had problems with her teaching style, criticizing her \u201cmonotonous and boring\u201d lectures and wishing she would do more than \u201cessentially read off her notes.\u201d \r\n\r\n\tThis course was described as having a good amount of work, with \u201cexcessively lengthy\u201d readings and a midterm and final. Some students felt Professor Ogle was \u201cvague on what she wanted on her tests, which made it confusing and frustrating to write to,\u201d and others felt \u201cthe assignments had not quite been ironed out.\u201d Students said the tests required too much information to be conveyed in too little time frame, and noted recitations \u201crequired an unnecessary amount of work and participation.\u201d Overall, students recommended this course as an informative way to learn about European international relations but stressed the need for the course structure to become more engaging.", "num_students": 78, "path": "/courses/27594/sections/001/reviews/5761-VANESSA-OGLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5761-VANESSA-OGLE", "first_name": "VANESSA", "last_name": "OGLE", "id": "5761-VANESSA-OGLE", "name": "VANESSA OGLE"}, "num_reviewers": 69, "id": "27594-001-5761-VANESSA-OGLE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-421", "path": "/courses/27594", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27594/sections", "values": [{"name": "EURO INT'L REL SINCE WWI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-421-001", "path": "/courses/27594/sections/001", "id": "27594-001", "aliases": ["HIST-421-001"]}]}, "id": 27594, "aliases": ["HIST-421"]}
