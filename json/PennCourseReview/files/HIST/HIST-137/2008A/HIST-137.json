The course explores this question across the 20th century, focusing on the origins and evolution of transnational organizations and movements. We will analyze a variety of actors above and below the level of the nation-state, from the League of Nations to Amnesty International. At the same time we will pay careful attention to the many countervailing forces that have resisted the process of globalization: various forms of nationalism, local ethnic and religious movements in places as far-flung as Central Africa and Northern Ireland, and struggles over territories and border control from Arizona to Kashmir. We will look at the long history of contention between these opposing trajectories, exploring such topics as Wilsonianism and its reception in Europe and beyond, transnational human rights norms, the environmentalist movement, institutions designed to deal with global threats such as the World Health Organization or the International Atomic Energy Agency, European integration, political Islam, and the War on Terror. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "EURO EMPIRES,1830-1947", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20318/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "2.72", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.81", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.12", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "EURO EMPIRES,1830-1947", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-137-001", "path": "/courses/20318/sections/001", "id": "20318-001", "aliases": ["HIST-137-001"]}, "comments": "This course explores the motivation that let to the \\'scramble for empire\\' in the mid-to-late nineteenth century; the reason why a handful of relatively small European nation-states subdued much of the rest of the world with apparent ease; and why their empires melted away so quickly after 1945.
