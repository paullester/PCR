{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4818"}, "description": "Monday: bought olive oil. Tuesday: hid indigo from custom officials. Wednesday: attacked by pirates. Thursday: sold water-logged flax. This course explores the history of trade in the Mediterranean before the discovery of the New World. We will examine how trade and patterns of trade fit into both the broader economies of the ancient and medieval worlds. We will also look at the culture of traders and merchants: how they organized their work; and thier social and cultural role in their societies. Secondary readings for the course are a mix of readings from historians and economists; these will be used to help understand the varied documents of traders themselves--accounts, letters, contracts, and court documents that illuminate the day-to-day struggles and satisfactions of pre-modern business life. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "MAKING MONEY BEFORE 1500", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20338/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MAKING MONEY BEFORE 1500", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-339-001", "path": "/courses/20338/sections/001", "id": "20338-001", "aliases": ["HIST-339-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/20338/sections/001/reviews/3322-JESSICA-GOLDBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3322-JESSICA-GOLDBERG", "first_name": "JESSICA", "last_name": "GOLDBERG", "id": "3322-JESSICA-GOLDBERG", "name": "JESSICA GOLDBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "20338-001-3322-JESSICA-GOLDBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-339", "path": "/courses/20338", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20338/sections", "values": [{"name": "MAKING MONEY BEFORE 1500", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-339-001", "path": "/courses/20338/sections/001", "id": "20338-001", "aliases": ["HIST-339-001"]}]}, "id": 20338, "aliases": ["HIST-339"]}
