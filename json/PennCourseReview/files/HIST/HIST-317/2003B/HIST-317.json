{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1560"}, "description": "Beginning with Christopher Columbus' eager description of them as \"Indians\" to the Spanish monarchs, the native inhabitants of the Americas have been the subject of representations that often reveal more about outsiders than about indigenous people themselves. Using historical and ethnographic sources, we ask in what measure do popular representations of Indians (for example, the Pocahontas story; or the Brazilian Indian as protector of the rainforest) correspond to the scholarly opinion. Why have popular representations circulated so widely, capturing the interest of non-Indians in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere? In what measure have representations influenced the native cultures themselves? Have they played a part in regimes of poower and domination? Correspondingly, have scholary opinions themselves been influenced by popular representations? \n\n", "semester": "2003B", "name": "ISLAM & THE WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2399/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.10", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "2.90"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM & THE WEST", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "HIST-317-910", "path": "/courses/2399/sections/910", "id": "2399-910", "aliases": ["HIST-317-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/2399/sections/910/reviews/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "first_name": "S.
