{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/582"}, "description": "This course offers a survey of European history, including both eastern and western Europe since World War II until the present. The course examines how Europe in all its complexity and cultures lived under the shadow of the Cold War. It examines the origins and nature of the cold War, not just in its diplomatic and political dimensions, but also its effects on the culture and people of Europe. It explores the reasons for the phenomenon of anti-Americanism and the series of revolts exploding throughout eastern Europe until the fall of the Berlin Wall. Finally, the course examines a number of thematic areas about European political culture, immigration, decolonization, the 1960s revolts and the 1970s terrorism, the resurgence of nationalism, but also the growth of the European community. The course explores the question: what does it mean to be European? \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "EUROPE SINCE 1945", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3080/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.39", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.96", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.61", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "2.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "EUROPE SINCE 1945", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-128-001", "path": "/courses/3080/sections/001", "id": "3080-001", "aliases": ["HIST-128-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/3080/sections/001/reviews/625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "STEINBERG", "id": "625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG", "name": "JONATHAN STEINBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "3080-001-625-JONATHAN-STEINBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-128", "path": "/courses/3080", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3080/sections", "values": [{"name": "EUROPE SINCE 1945", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-128-001", "path": "/courses/3080/sections/001", "id": "3080-001", "aliases": ["HIST-128-001"]}]}, "id": 3080, "aliases": ["HIST-128"]}
