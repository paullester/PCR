The course examines how Europe in all its complexity and cultures lived under the shadow of the Cold War.

It explores the reasons for the phenomenon of anti-Americanism and the series of revolts exploding throughout eastern Europe until the fall of the Berlin Wall. Finally, the course examines a number of thematic areas about European political culture, immigration, decolonization, the 1960s revolts and the 1970s terrorism, the resurgence of nationalism, but also the growth of the European community. The course explores the question: what does it mean to be European? \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "EUROPE SINCE 1945", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13387/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-128", "path": "/courses/13387", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13387/sections", "values": [{"name": "EUROPE SINCE 1945", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HIST-128-601", "path": "/courses/13387/sections/601", "id": "13387-601", "aliases": ["HIST-128-601"]}]}, "id": 13387, "aliases": ["HIST-128"]}
