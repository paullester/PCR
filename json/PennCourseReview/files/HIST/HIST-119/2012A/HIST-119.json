{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1338"}, "description": "Over the last two centuries, the modern corporation has emerged as the dominant form of doing business throughout the world. As such, it not only effects people's daily lives, but also influences government policies and larger trends in society. This course looks at the history of the international corporation from the industrial revolution to the present, to consider how corporations have evolved and the varying ways in which they have influenced the history of our times. We will consider the fundamental debates surrounding the responsibility between shareholders, managers, workers, customers, and most importantly, society as a whole. Much of the course will involve an examination of case studies of individual companies, industries or issues, to understand how corporations have functioned in specific instances. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "HIST OF MOD BUS.
