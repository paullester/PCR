Some, however, did complain about the class lectures, saying that they \u201cskipped around a lot, which made it difficult to understand main concepts.\u201d Others felt that the readings should have been discussed more in class and \u201cmore references directly to readings in class might encourage doing them.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Drew was declared by all his students to be an amazing teacher. Students commented that he had a \u201cknack for communicating seemingly mundane subject matter.\u201d  Others described him as \u201cextremely flexible and available,\u201d and also \u201cvery enthusiastic.\u201d Students complimented Professor Drew for \u201cmaking the topic interesting by using humor,\u201d and doing \u201ca great job stimulating class through discussion and with stories.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest complaints students had was concerning the amount of reading for the class. Many said that their \u201conly criticism of the class would be that some of the readings are extremely long and we barely discuss them.\u201d Several other students complained that \u201creadings at times seemed to be peripheral\u201d and that there was so much reading \u201cit was hard to keep up.\u201d", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/20316/sections/001/reviews/614-JERRY-DREW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/614-JERRY-DREW", "first_name": "JERRY", "last_name": "DREW", "id": "614-JERRY-DREW", "name": "JERRY DREW"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "20316-001-614-JERRY-DREW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-119", "path": "/courses/20316", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20316/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST OF MOD BUS.
