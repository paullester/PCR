{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3653"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with a solid knowledge of Atlantic history during the early modern period (XV-XVIII centuries). Through readings of primary and secondary texts we will discuss the cultural, religious, intellectual, and economic developments of Europe, Africa, and the Americas, as well as the connections, struggles, and mutual influences between the peoples of these three continents. Throughout the semester we will study several important topics: medieval precedents of early modern expansion; theories of empire; ideologies and systems of conquest and colonialization; the relevance of race and slavery to the understanding of the early modern Atlantic world; how different peoples perceived others and themselves; how European imperialism and colonialization affected the internal development of Africa and America; the role played by religion in the Atlantic world; persistence and continuity of Native cultures and beliefs during an age of expansion; the creation of new identities; the role played by African nations in the creation of the Atlantic world; and the creation of an Atlantic economy. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "EARLY MOD ATLANTIC WORLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10534/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.48", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "1.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "2.84", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "EARLY MOD ATLANTIC WORLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-178-401", "path": "/courses/10534/sections/401", "id": "10534-401", "aliases": ["HIST-178-401", "LTAM-178-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/10534/sections/401/reviews/2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "first_name": "ANTONIO", "last_name": "FEROS", "id": "2775-ANTONIO-FEROS", "name": "ANTONIO FEROS"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "10534-401-2775-ANTONIO-FEROS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-178", "path": "/courses/10534", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10534/sections", "values": [{"name": "EARLY MOD ATLANTIC WORLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-178-401", "path": "/courses/10534/sections/401", "id": "10534-401", "aliases": ["HIST-178-401", "LTAM-178-401"]}]}, "id": 10534, "aliases": ["HIST-178", "LTAM-178"]}
