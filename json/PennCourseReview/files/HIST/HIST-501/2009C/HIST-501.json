{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4587"}, "description": "What is natural about sex, gender, sexuality and reproduction? This course examines a range of social science, feminist, and historical theories that try to make sense of some of the most intimate and seemingly timeless features of the human experience: the difference between the sexes, the relationship between gender and anatomical sex, and the emotional and social dynamics of reproduction. Among the topics we will consider are the relationship between public and private life; the historic connections between patriarchy and capitalism; reproduction as a social and cultural as well a biological phenomenon; class, race, ethnicity, and religion as alternative sites of identity; citizenship, legal personhood and contract; the dynamics of empire and conquest; feminism; sexuality; the history of the body; visual culture; postmodernist, poststructuralist, and postfeminist ways of thinking about sex and gender; the current debates about the meaning of marriage; and the challenge presented by transgender lives. The course is designed for graduate students but open to undergraduates with the permission of the instructor. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "THE NATURE OF SEX", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17533/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.15", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.87"}, "section": {"name": "THE NATURE OF SEX", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-501-401", "path": "/courses/17533/sections/401", "id": "17533-401", "aliases": ["HIST-501-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/17533/sections/401/reviews/1509-KATHLEEN-M--BROWN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1509-KATHLEEN-M--BROWN", "first_name": "KATHLEEN M.", "last_name": "BROWN", "id": "1509-KATHLEEN-M--BROWN", "name": "KATHLEEN M.
