{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3942"}, "description": "Between the idyllic village and the modern city. Between nostalgia and estrangement. Between Mother India and India Inc. Since its inception in the 1910s, Indian popular cinema has straddled the great rural/urban divide in ways that in recent times have largely bifurcated popular cinema into the 'massy' and the 'classy'. Through a historical overview of films (both 'Bollywood' and other regional popular cinema) from silent, colonial, and post-colonial eras into the contemporary era of globalization, this course will look at the diverse cinematic representations of the village and the city, often as counterpoints reinforcing the recurring, if problematic, divides between tradition and modernity, mass and class, local and global. We will also examine how these diverse portrayals of the rural/urban divide on the Indian celluloid depict shifting understandings of nationalism, modernity, migration, criminality, censorship, globalization and consumerism as well as of caste, class, gender and religion. By familiarizing students with filmic narratives such as song-and-dance sequences, masala-style potpourri of genres, melodrama, etc., this course will also sensitize them to how the particular uses of these narrative conventions reflect and shape the social and cultural contexts in which these films are produced, circulated and consumed. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INDIAN CINEMA & SOCIETY: Indian Cinema & Scoiety: Bollywood and Beyond", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30988/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "2.45", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "INDIAN CINEMA & SOCIETY: Indian Cinema & Scoiety: Bollywood and Beyond", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "SAST-213-601", "path": "/courses/30988/sections/601", "id": "30988-601", "aliases": ["SAST-213-601", "CINE-215-601", "GSWS-213-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/30988/sections/601/reviews/4363-KATHRYN-C-HARDY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4363-KATHRYN-C-HARDY", "first_name": "KATHRYN C", "last_name": "HARDY", "id": "4363-KATHRYN-C-HARDY", "name": "KATHRYN C HARDY"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "30988-601-4363-KATHRYN-C-HARDY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-213", "path": "/courses/30988", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30988/sections", "values": [{"name": "INDIAN CINEMA & SOCIETY: Indian Cinema & Scoiety: Bollywood and Beyond", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "SAST-213-601", "path": "/courses/30988/sections/601", "id": "30988-601", "aliases": ["SAST-213-601", "CINE-215-601", "GSWS-213-601"]}]}, "id": 30988, "aliases": ["SAST-213", "CINE-215", "GSWS-213"]}
