{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5183"}, "description": "This course investigates the everyday practices and customs of South Asians in America. Every immigrant group has its own history, customs, beliefs and values, making each unique while simultaneously a part of the \"melting pot\" or salad bowl\" of American society. Yet how do people define themselves and their ethnicities living in a diasporic context? By taking into account the burgeoning South Asian American population as our model, this course will explore the basic themes surrounding the lives that immigrants are living in America, and more specifically the identity which the second generation, born and/or raised in American, is developing. South Asians in the U.S. will be divided thematically covering the topics of ethnicity, marriage, gender, religion, and pop culture. Reading and assignments will discuss a variety of issues and viewpoints that are a part of the fabric of South Asia, but will focus on the interpretation of such expressive culture in the United States. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28572/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ASAM-160-401", "path": "/courses/28572/sections/401", "id": "28572-401", "aliases": ["ASAM-160-401", "SAST-290-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/28572/sections/401/reviews/2327-FARIHA-KHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2327-FARIHA-KHAN", "first_name": "FARIHA", "last_name": "KHAN", "id": "2327-FARIHA-KHAN", "name": "FARIHA KHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "28572-401-2327-FARIHA-KHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASAM-160", "path": "/courses/28572", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28572/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ASAM-160-401", "path": "/courses/28572/sections/401", "id": "28572-401", "aliases": ["ASAM-160-401", "SAST-290-401"]}]}, "id": 28572, "aliases": ["ASAM-160", "SAST-290"]}
