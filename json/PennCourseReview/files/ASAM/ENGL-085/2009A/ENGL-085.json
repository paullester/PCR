Readings seek to explore developments in later twentieth-century culture, from cold war conflicts and the new velocities of mass media to the dizzying postmodern experiments in form. The authors read for this course vary from term to term.\r\nStudents were impressed with the quality of this course, describing it as \u201cone of the most interesting and diverse classes\u201d at Penn and not very difficult. The assigned courses were very valuable and students reported learning a lot from the material. However, students thought that the course was not well paced since \u201cthe syllabus is very top heavy and could be more evenly distributed\u201d.\r\nProfessor Wahlert was well rated by his students for they believed him to be \u201cincredibly enthusiastic and his energy is infectious in the classroom\u201d. He greatly stimulated their interest during class discussions and \u201cchose a diverse range of interesting primary and secondary sources\u201d. Professor Wahlert was very accessible and students considered it a \u201creal privilege to be one of his students\u201d.\r\nThe course load was described as heavy, for there were many assigned readings and students were required to watch films outside of class. However, this was not a deterrent and the course still came highly recommended for both majors and non-majors.", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/15621/sections/401/reviews/2113-LANCE-D-WAHLERT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2113-LANCE-D-WAHLERT", "first_name": "LANCE D", "last_name": "WAHLERT", "id": "2113-LANCE-D-WAHLERT", "name": "LANCE D WAHLERT"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "15621-401-2113-LANCE-D-WAHLERT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-085", "path": "/courses/15621", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15621/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDICINE & LITERATURE: Medicine in Literature and Film:  1850-Present", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-085-401", "path": "/courses/15621/sections/401", "id": "15621-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-085-401", "BCHE-085-401", "HSOC-148-401", "CINE-085-401"]}]}, "id": 15621, "aliases": ["ENGL-085", "BCHE-085", "HSOC-148", "CINE-085"]}
