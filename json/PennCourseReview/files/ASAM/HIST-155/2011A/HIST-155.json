One student felt that the material became \u201ca little repetitive\u201d as the course went on, but most students found the subject matter to be \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cquite enjoyable.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students appreciated Professor Azuma\u2019s genuine concern for and dedication to his students.
