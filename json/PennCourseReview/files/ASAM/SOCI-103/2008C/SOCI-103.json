{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2132"}, "description": "This class will introduce you to sociological research of Asian Americans and engage in the \"model minority\" stereotype. We begin by a brief introduction toU.S. immigration history and sociological theories about assimilation and racial stratification. The class will also cover research on racial and ethnic identity, educational stratification, mass media images, interracial marriage, multiracials, transracial adoption, and the viability of an Asian American panethnic identity. We will also examine the similarities and differences of Asian Americans relative to other minority groups. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ASIAN AMER IN CONTEMP SO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19315/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "ASIAN AMER IN CONTEMP SO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-103-401", "path": "/courses/19315/sections/401", "id": "19315-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-103-401", "ASAM-001-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/19315/sections/401/reviews/1715-GRACE-KAO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1715-GRACE-KAO", "first_name": "GRACE", "last_name": "KAO", "id": "1715-GRACE-KAO", "name": "GRACE KAO"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "19315-401-1715-GRACE-KAO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-103", "path": "/courses/19315", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19315/sections", "values": [{"name": "ASIAN AMER IN CONTEMP SO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-103-401", "path": "/courses/19315/sections/401", "id": "19315-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-103-401", "ASAM-001-401"]}]}, "id": 19315, "aliases": ["SOCI-103", "ASAM-001"]}
