{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5005"}, "description": "This reading-and discussion-intensive seminar examines the phenomenon of migration into, out of, within, and across the Middle East and North Africa. We will focus on the period from the late nineteenth century to the present, and will emphasize the cultural (rather than economic) consequences of migration. Along the way we will trace connections between the Middle East and other regions-- notably the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Caucasus, and Western Europe. Readings are interdisciplinary and include works of history, anthropology, sociology, medical research, literature, political science, geography, and human rights advocacy. As students develop final projects on topics of their choice, we will spend time throughout the semester discussing tactics for research and writing. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MIGRATION & MIDDLE EAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22137/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.70", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "3.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.91"}, "section": {"name": "MIGRATION & MIDDLE EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-239-401", "path": "/courses/22137/sections/401", "id": "22137-401", "aliases": ["NELC-239-401", "NELC-539-401", "SAST-269-401", "ASAM-239-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/22137/sections/401/reviews/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "first_name": "HEATHER", "last_name": "SHARKEY", "id": "1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "name": "HEATHER SHARKEY"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "22137-401-1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-239", "path": "/courses/22137", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22137/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIGRATION & MIDDLE EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-239-401", "path": "/courses/22137/sections/401", "id": "22137-401", "aliases": ["NELC-239-401", "NELC-539-401", "SAST-269-401", "ASAM-239-401"]}]}, "id": 22137, "aliases": ["NELC-239", "NELC-539", "SAST-269", "ASAM-239"]}
