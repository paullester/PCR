{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/172"}, "description": "Giving special, but by no means exclusive, attention to issues of gender and sexuality, this class explores many current issues facing Asian America. Among these will be immigration, generational conflict, entrepreneurship, economic class, globalization, politics, and anti-Asian American violence. Because the Asian American population is varied and diverse, the concerns of the class will be varied and diverse. We will read fiction and non-fiction, watch television and movies, and engage in detailed analysis. Most of all, we will attempt to understand the problems and possibilities facing individual Asian Americans in 2002. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CURRENT ISSUES IN ASAM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/172/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.72", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.61", "rInstructorAccess": "3.72", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.83", "rCommAbility": "3.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.94"}, "section": {"name": "CURRENT ISSUES IN ASAM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ASAM-055-301", "path": "/courses/172/sections/301", "id": "172-301", "aliases": ["ASAM-055-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/172/sections/301/reviews/145-PARTHA-MAZUMDAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/145-PARTHA-MAZUMDAR", "first_name": "PARTHA", "last_name": "MAZUMDAR", "id": "145-PARTHA-MAZUMDAR", "name": "PARTHA MAZUMDAR"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "172-301-145-PARTHA-MAZUMDAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASAM-055", "path": "/courses/172", "sections": {"path": "/courses/172/sections", "values": [{"name": "CURRENT ISSUES IN ASAM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ASAM-055-301", "path": "/courses/172/sections/301", "id": "172-301", "aliases": ["ASAM-055-301"]}]}, "id": 172, "aliases": ["ASAM-055"]}
