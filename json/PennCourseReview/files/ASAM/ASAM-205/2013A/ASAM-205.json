{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1228"}, "description": "Who is Asian American and how and where do we recognize Asian America? This interdisciplinary course explores the multiple factors that define Asian American identity and community. In order to provide a sketch of the multifacted experience of this growing minority group, we will discuss a wide variety of texts from scholarly, artistic, and popular (film, cinematic) sources that mark key moments in the cultural history of Asia America. The course will address major themes of community life including migration history, Asian American as model minority, race, class, and transnational scope of Asian America. In combination with the readings, this class will foster and promote independent research based on site visits to various Asian American communities in Philadelphia and will host community leaders as guest lecturers. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ASIAN AMERI COMMUNITIES: Asian American Communities", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29895/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.93", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "ASIAN AMERI COMMUNITIES: Asian American Communities", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ASAM-205-401", "path": "/courses/29895/sections/401", "id": "29895-401", "aliases": ["ASAM-205-401", "URBS-207-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/29895/sections/401/reviews/2327-FARIHA-KHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2327-FARIHA-KHAN", "first_name": "FARIHA", "last_name": "KHAN", "id": "2327-FARIHA-KHAN", "name": "FARIHA KHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "29895-401-2327-FARIHA-KHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASAM-205", "path": "/courses/29895", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29895/sections", "values": [{"name": "ASIAN AMERI COMMUNITIES: Asian American Communities", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ASAM-205-401", "path": "/courses/29895/sections/401", "id": "29895-401", "aliases": ["ASAM-205-401", "URBS-207-401"]}]}, "id": 29895, "aliases": ["ASAM-205", "URBS-207"]}
