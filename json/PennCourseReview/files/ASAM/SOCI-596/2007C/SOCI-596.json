{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1519"}, "description": "This graduate seminar will introduce students to some of the key theoretical and empirical work in the sociology of education. We will focus around the question of stratification and how systems of schooling maintain or alleviate inequality. The class will examine classical approaches to schooling, schools as organizations, schools and their effects on social mobility, (class, race, and gender) stratification in achievement and attainment, tracking/ability grouping, theories and empirical work on social and cultural capital, school choice, and cross-national expansion of education. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13921/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-596-401", "path": "/courses/13921/sections/401", "id": "13921-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-596-401", "ASAM-590-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/13921/sections/401/reviews/1715-GRACE-KAO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1715-GRACE-KAO", "first_name": "GRACE", "last_name": "KAO", "id": "1715-GRACE-KAO", "name": "GRACE KAO"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "13921-401-1715-GRACE-KAO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-596", "path": "/courses/13921", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13921/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-596-401", "path": "/courses/13921/sections/401", "id": "13921-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-596-401", "ASAM-590-401"]}]}, "id": 13921, "aliases": ["SOCI-596", "ASAM-590"]}
