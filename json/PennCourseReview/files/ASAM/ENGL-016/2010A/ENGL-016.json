{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "Gender, Sexuality and the Modern Novel: Virginia Woolf", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25903/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "Gender, Sexuality and the Modern Novel: Virginia Woolf", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/25903/sections/401", "id": "25903-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "GSOC-016-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/25903/sections/401/reviews/2935-ANDREW-J-GAEDTKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2935-ANDREW-J-GAEDTKE", "first_name": "ANDREW J", "last_name": "GAEDTKE", "id": "2935-ANDREW-J-GAEDTKE", "name": "ANDREW J GAEDTKE"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "25903-401-2935-ANDREW-J-GAEDTKE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/25903", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25903/sections", "values": [{"name": "Gender, Sexuality and the Modern Novel: Virginia Woolf", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/25903/sections/401", "id": "25903-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "GSOC-016-401"]}]}, "id": 25903, "aliases": ["ENGL-016", "GSOC-016"]}
