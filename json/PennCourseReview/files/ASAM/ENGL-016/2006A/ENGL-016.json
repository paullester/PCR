{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Discipline and Punish:  Crime and Criminality in Early American", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7593/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.42", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Discipline and Punish:  Crime and Criminality in Early American", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/7593/sections/301", "id": "7593-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301", "WSTD-016-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/7593/sections/301/reviews/2941-DAVID-KAZANJIAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2941-DAVID-KAZANJIAN", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "KAZANJIAN", "id": "2941-DAVID-KAZANJIAN", "name": "DAVID KAZANJIAN"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "7593-301-2941-DAVID-KAZANJIAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "1.57", "rStimulateInterest": "2.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Poetry in Philadelphia:  Two Rivers, Many Voices", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/7593/sections/401", "id": "7593-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "WSTD-016-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/7593/sections/401/reviews/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "first_name": "DEBORAH S", "last_name": "BURNHAM", "id": "437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "name": "DEBORAH S BURNHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "7593-401-437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/7593", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7593/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Discipline and Punish:  Crime and Criminality in Early American", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/7593/sections/301", "id": "7593-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301", "WSTD-016-301"]}, {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Seeing and Believing in 19th Century America", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-302", "path": "/courses/7593/sections/302", "id": "7593-302", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-302", "WSTD-016-302"]}, {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Poetry in Philadelphia:  Two Rivers, Many Voices", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/7593/sections/401", "id": "7593-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "WSTD-016-401"]}]}, "id": 7593, "aliases": ["ENGL-016", "WSTD-016"]}
