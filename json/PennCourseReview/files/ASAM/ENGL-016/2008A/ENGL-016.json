{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "MODERN AMERICAN POETRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20036/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.54", "rDifficulty": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "3.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.77", "rCourseQuality": "3.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.85", "rReadingsValue": "3.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.62", "rCommAbility": "3.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.92"}, "section": {"name": "MODERN AMERICAN POETRY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/20036/sections/301", "id": "20036-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/20036/sections/301/reviews/2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK", "first_name": "JOSEPHINE NOCK-HEE", "last_name": "PARK", "id": "2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK", "name": "JOSEPHINE NOCK-HEE PARK"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "20036-301-2122-JOSEPHINE-NOCK-HEE-PARK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/20036", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20036/sections", "values": [{"name": "MODERN AMERICAN POETRY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/20036/sections/301", "id": "20036-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}]}, "id": 20036, "aliases": ["ENGL-016"]}
