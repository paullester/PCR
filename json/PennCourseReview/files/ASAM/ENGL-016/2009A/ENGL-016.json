{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "Context of Poetic Innovation:  William Carlos Williams and Robert Creeley", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15603/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.20", "rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "1.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "Context of Poetic Innovation:  William Carlos Williams and Robert Creeley", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-302", "path": "/courses/15603/sections/302", "id": "15603-302", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-302", "CINE-016-302", "GSOC-016-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/15603/sections/302/reviews/432-ROBERT-PERELMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/432-ROBERT-PERELMAN", "first_name": "ROBERT", "last_name": "PERELMAN", "id": "432-ROBERT-PERELMAN", "name": "ROBERT PERELMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "15603-302-432-ROBERT-PERELMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.46", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "3.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.54", "rCommAbility": "3.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: BURDEN OF REPRESENTATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/15603/sections/401", "id": "15603-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "CINE-016-401", "GSOC-016-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/15603/sections/401/reviews/2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "first_name": "HEATHER K.", "last_name": "LOVE", "id": "2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "name": "HEATHER K.
