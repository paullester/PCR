{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: The Ancients and Shakespeare on Justice and Happiness", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/378/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: The Ancients and Shakespeare on Justice and Happiness", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/378/sections/301", "id": "378-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/378/sections/301/reviews/404-ANNE-D-HALL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/404-ANNE-D-HALL", "first_name": "ANNE D", "last_name": "HALL", "id": "404-ANNE-D-HALL", "name": "ANNE D HALL"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "378-301-404-ANNE-D-HALL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/378", "sections": {"path": "/courses/378/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: The Ancients and Shakespeare on Justice and Happiness", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/378/sections/301", "id": "378-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}, {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-302", "path": "/courses/378/sections/302", "id": "378-302", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-302"]}]}, "id": 378, "aliases": ["ENGL-016"]}
