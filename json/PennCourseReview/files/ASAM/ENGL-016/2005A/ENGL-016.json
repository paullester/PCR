{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "POETRY IN PHILADELPHIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10281/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "POETRY IN PHILADELPHIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/10281/sections/401", "id": "10281-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "WSTD-016-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/10281/sections/401/reviews/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "first_name": "DEBORAH S", "last_name": "BURNHAM", "id": "437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "name": "DEBORAH S BURNHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "10281-401-437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/10281", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10281/sections", "values": [{"name": "POETRY IN PHILADELPHIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/10281/sections/401", "id": "10281-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401", "WSTD-016-401"]}]}, "id": 10281, "aliases": ["ENGL-016", "WSTD-016"]}
