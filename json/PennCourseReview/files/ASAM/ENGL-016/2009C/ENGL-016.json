{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: TRAGEDY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17227/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: TRAGEDY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/17227/sections/301", "id": "17227-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301", "CINE-016-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/17227/sections/301/reviews/2115-REBECCA-W--BUSHNELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2115-REBECCA-W--BUSHNELL", "first_name": "REBECCA W.", "last_name": "BUSHNELL", "id": "2115-REBECCA-W--BUSHNELL", "name": "REBECCA W.

Does teaching aim to make students accept dominant social norms, or does it give them the tools to question them? In this course, we will consider the theory and practice of pedagogy in a range of texts. We will look both at classic statements on the meaning and politics of education as well as representations of teaching and learning in memoirs, novels, short stories, and films. Topics will include critical pedagogy, language and power, school reform, class and upward mobility, education and the professions, social control, pedagogical eros, race and racism, and the social space of the classroom. Reading may include texts by Plato, Rousseau, Henry James, Margaret Mead, Richard Wright, Muriel Spark, Richard Rodriguez, Helen Keller, Sherman Alexie, Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Toni Cade Bambara, Richard Powers, Barack Obama, John Dewey, Paolo Freire, bell hooks, Maria Montessori, Jacques Ranciere, Deborah Britzman, Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, Paul Willis, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and others. We will also watch films including Blackboard Jungle, The 400 Blows, High School, Half Nelson, Happy-Go-Lucky, and The Class, and will consider the representation of pedagogy in The Wire. \r\n\r\nStudents who took this course said they thoroughly enjoyed it and that this was one of the best courses that they had taken; with one student saying that it was their \u201cfavorite.\u201d Many said the class was stimulating and that they had learned a lot from it.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nMost of the students who wrote reviews said that Professor Love was very knowledgeable and that they learned a lot from her.

One student also mentioned that Professor Love treated them with more respect than they had ever been treated by an instructor.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nThis course is a Freshman seminar, and is therefore open to freshmen only. They also mentioned that this course involved a variety of media, such as books and movies. Class work includes a few short papers, a class presentation, and a longer final paper. \r\n", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/17227/sections/401/reviews/2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "first_name": "HEATHER K.", "last_name": "LOVE", "id": "2120-HEATHER-K--LOVE", "name": "HEATHER K.
