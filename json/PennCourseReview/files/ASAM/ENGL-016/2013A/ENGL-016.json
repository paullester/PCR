{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: WOMEN AND LITERATURE:  CONTEMPORARY FICTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30181/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: WOMEN AND LITERATURE:  CONTEMPORARY FICTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/30181/sections/401", "id": "30181-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/30181/sections/401/reviews/1403-RITA-BARNARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1403-RITA-BARNARD", "first_name": "RITA", "last_name": "BARNARD", "id": "1403-RITA-BARNARD", "name": "RITA BARNARD"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "30181-401-1403-RITA-BARNARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/30181", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30181/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: WOMEN AND LITERATURE:  CONTEMPORARY FICTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-401", "path": "/courses/30181/sections/401", "id": "30181-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-401"]}]}, "id": 30181, "aliases": ["ENGL-016"]}
