{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "ROMANCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11685/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.07"}, "section": {"name": "ROMANCE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/11685/sections/301", "id": "11685-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/11685/sections/301/reviews/2759-WENDY-L-STEINER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2759-WENDY-L-STEINER", "first_name": "WENDY L", "last_name": "STEINER", "id": "2759-WENDY-L-STEINER", "name": "WENDY L STEINER"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "11685-301-2759-WENDY-L-STEINER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.15", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.62"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: 19th Century Literature in 20th Century Film", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-302", "path": "/courses/11685/sections/302", "id": "11685-302", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/11685/sections/302/reviews/2942-MARCY-J--DINIUS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2942-MARCY-J--DINIUS", "first_name": "MARCY J.", "last_name": "DINIUS", "id": "2942-MARCY-J--DINIUS", "name": "MARCY J.
