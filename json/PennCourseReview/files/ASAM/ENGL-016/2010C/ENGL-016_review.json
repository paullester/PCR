This semester focused on the Modernist Short Story. The seminar covered stories and story-sequences by James Joyce, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield, Willa Cather, Sherwood Anderson, and Jean Rhys. The course began with detective fiction (Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tales) and modernist precursors (Poe and Anton Chekhov). The course ended with the resurgence of moral realism after 1950, studying writers concerned with fundamental questions of good and evil (Flannery O'Connor, Muriel Spark, Shirley Jackson).  This course asked what makes memorable stories tick, how story-sequences compare to novels, and why the novel (a genre in which many of our writers were accomplished experts) came in the long run to eclipse short stories in the world of fiction. Written requirements included one 5-page critical essay, one 10-page critical essay, and five informal response papers.
