{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/378"}, "description": "Freshman Seminars under the title \"Topics in Literature\" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Books That Make You Cry:  Print and Sensibility in the 18th Century", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1534/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.80", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.60", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Books That Make You Cry:  Print and Sensibility in the 18th Century", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/1534/sections/301", "id": "1534-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/1534/sections/301/reviews/409-JENNIFER-SNEAD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/409-JENNIFER-SNEAD", "first_name": "JENNIFER", "last_name": "SNEAD", "id": "409-JENNIFER-SNEAD", "name": "JENNIFER SNEAD"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "1534-301-409-JENNIFER-SNEAD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-016", "path": "/courses/1534", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1534/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN LITERATURE: Books That Make You Cry:  Print and Sensibility in the 18th Century", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-016-301", "path": "/courses/1534/sections/301", "id": "1534-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-016-301"]}]}, "id": 1534, "aliases": ["ENGL-016"]}
