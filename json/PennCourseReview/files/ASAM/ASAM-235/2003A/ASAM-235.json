{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1230"}, "description": "This course explores what happens as Asian languages and their speakers come into contact with other languages in the United States, as well as how we can analyze language use to examine Asian American issues. We will first examine what we mean by concepts such as \"Asian American\" and \"language\", situating the course within a theoretical framework that draws heavily on Asian American studies, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology and discourse analysis. We will devote much of our attention to studies that closely analyze face-to-face interaction. We will cover topics such as language contact (e.g., Hawai'i Creole), language loss, language maintenance, the English-only movement, bilingual education, heritage language learning (e.g., Saturday schools), language brokering (children translating for parents), codeswitching (mixing languages in interaction), and cultural, racial, ethnic and sexual identity. Each participant will write two response papers for course readings, lead two class discussions, and conduct two small research projects. The first project is a language history, which involves students in interviewing someone about their language history and language use. The final project involves audio- or video-recording and analyzing naturally occurring interaction, and/or \n\ncollecting and analyzing print communication (e.g., magazine ads, comic books) or computer-mediated communication (e.g., emails, chat rooms). \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ASIAN AMERICANS & LANGU", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1338/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.22", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "ASIAN AMERICANS & LANGU", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ASAM-235-601", "path": "/courses/1338/sections/601", "id": "1338-601", "aliases": ["ASAM-235-601", "LING-235-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/1338/sections/601/reviews/1793-ANGELA-R-REYES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1793-ANGELA-R-REYES", "first_name": "ANGELA R", "last_name": "REYES", "id": "1793-ANGELA-R-REYES", "name": "ANGELA R REYES"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "1338-601-1793-ANGELA-R-REYES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASAM-235", "path": "/courses/1338", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1338/sections", "values": [{"name": "ASIAN AMERICANS & LANGU", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ASAM-235-601", "path": "/courses/1338/sections/601", "id": "1338-601", "aliases": ["ASAM-235-601", "LING-235-601"]}]}, "id": 1338, "aliases": ["ASAM-235", "LING-235"]}
