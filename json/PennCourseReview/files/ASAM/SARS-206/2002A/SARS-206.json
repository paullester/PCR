{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1010"}, "description": "This course begins with a historical survey of South Asian immigration in the United States. It continues with a broad look at cultural, social, and political issues which confront the South Asian American community today, issues such as citizenship and transnationality, minoritization, economic opportunity, cultural and religious maintenance and adaptation, changes in family structure and gender roles, and generational shifts. It concludes with an examination of the emergence of a body of creative writings by South Asians in America as an expatriate Indian literature of exile and as American immigrant and ethnic literature. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1010/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-206-401", "path": "/courses/1010/sections/401", "id": "1010-401", "aliases": ["SARS-206-401", "WSTD-209-401", "SARS-506-401", "ASAM-209-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/1010/sections/401/reviews/72-ROSANE-D-ROCHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/72-ROSANE-D-ROCHER", "first_name": "ROSANE D", "last_name": "ROCHER", "id": "72-ROSANE-D-ROCHER", "name": "ROSANE D ROCHER"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "1010-401-72-ROSANE-D-ROCHER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-206", "path": "/courses/1010", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1010/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-206-401", "path": "/courses/1010/sections/401", "id": "1010-401", "aliases": ["SARS-206-401", "WSTD-209-401", "SARS-506-401", "ASAM-209-401"]}]}, "id": 1010, "aliases": ["SARS-206", "WSTD-209", "SARS-506", "ASAM-209"]}
