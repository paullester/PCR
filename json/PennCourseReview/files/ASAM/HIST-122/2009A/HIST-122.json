{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3652"}, "description": "The centennial of Korean immigration to America was celebrated in 2003. The Korean-American experience evolved from early patriotic nationalism and the independence movement before the Liberation of the homeland in 1945 to the waves of immigration, following the Korean War and division, in the past decades. The Los Angeles riots in 1992 marked a turning point in community consciousness and activism. This course explores Korean-American history, identity and narrative from the late nineteenth century to the present, highlighting the issues of politics, race, gender, generations, spirituality and community. Films, documentaries and websites will be included in class discussions. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "KOREAN-AMERICAN HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15894/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.67", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "1.11", "rRecommendMajor": "1.67", "rCourseQuality": "1.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "1.56", "rReadingsValue": "1.89", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.33", "rCommAbility": "1.22", "rInstructorQuality": "1.36"}, "section": {"name": "KOREAN-AMERICAN HISTORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-122-401", "path": "/courses/15894/sections/401", "id": "15894-401", "aliases": ["HIST-122-401", "ASAM-122-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/15894/sections/401/reviews/4366-WAYNE-PATTERSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4366-WAYNE-PATTERSON", "first_name": "WAYNE", "last_name": "PATTERSON", "id": "4366-WAYNE-PATTERSON", "name": "WAYNE PATTERSON"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "15894-401-4366-WAYNE-PATTERSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-122", "path": "/courses/15894", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15894/sections", "values": [{"name": "KOREAN-AMERICAN HISTORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-122-401", "path": "/courses/15894/sections/401", "id": "15894-401", "aliases": ["HIST-122-401", "ASAM-122-401"]}]}, "id": 15894, "aliases": ["HIST-122", "ASAM-122"]}
