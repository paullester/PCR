Some students found him to be disappointing because \u201che [was] rarely available to help students\u201d and \u201che cancelled every other lecture.  Since the class met once a week, some students felt that they rarely saw him.\r\n\r\nMEAM 101 students generally felt that this course was \u201cthe basis of all mechanical engineering,\u201d and \u201ca great course to learn solidworks.\u201d Some students felt that it should be required for MEAM majors. Some agreed, \u201cIt would be perfect for Fall of freshman year.\u201d  Others felt that the course \u201ccovers fundamental mechanical skills and design strategies that [can be] incredibly useful for future courses such as MEAM 247 and 347.\u201d It was highly recommended to all engineers, whether they are MEAM majors or not.\r\n\r\n", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/23379/sections/001/reviews/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "FIENE", "id": "3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "name": "JONATHAN FIENE"}, "num_reviewers": 45, "id": "23379-001-3916-JONATHAN-FIENE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-101", "path": "/courses/23379", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23379/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO MECH DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-101-001", "path": "/courses/23379/sections/001", "id": "23379-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-101-001"]}]}, "id": 23379, "aliases": ["MEAM-101"]}
