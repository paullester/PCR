Topics include: product definition (needfinding, observation, sketching, and brainstorming); computer-aided design (part creation, assemblies, and animation using SolidWorks); fundamental engineering design practices (material selection, dimensioning, tolerances, etc.); basic computer simulation and analysis; and rapid prototyping (laser cutter, 3-D fused-deposition modeling, and an introduction to computer- controlled machining).\r\n\r\nStudents overall felt that the course was \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cfun,\u201d and \u201cthe best.\u201d The course allowed for \u201ccreativity and ingenuity\u201d and was lauded by most as \u201cabsolutely worth it.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Fiene to be \u201coutstanding,\u201d and felt that both the professors and TAs \u201care passionate about the course.\u201d However, some students also felt that \u201cclear, helpful feedback\u201d was not given because the class was \u201cself-directed.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents overall felt the course was \u201ca big time commitment,\u201d but still felt that the class is \u201camazing\u201d \u201cwhether you are in Wharton, CAS, SEAS, or Nursing.\u201d However, some students also found \u201cthe grading system to be a little unclear.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/27727/sections/001/reviews/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "FIENE", "id": "3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "name": "JONATHAN FIENE"}, "num_reviewers": 59, "id": "27727-001-3916-JONATHAN-FIENE"}]
