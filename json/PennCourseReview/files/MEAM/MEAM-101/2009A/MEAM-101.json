{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1399"}, "description": "This hands-on, project-based course covers the fundamentals of the modern mechanical design process, from needfinding and brainstorming to the basics of computerized manufacturing and rapid prototyping. Topics include: product definition (needfinding, observation, sketching, and brainstorming); computer-aided design (part creation, assemblies, and animation using SolidWorks); fundamental engineering design practices (material selection, dimensioning, tolerances, etc.); basic computer simulation and analysis; and rapid prototyping (laser cutter, 3-D fused-deposition modeling, and an introduction to computer-controlled machining). \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "INTRO TO CAD/CAM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16052/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.61", "rDifficulty": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "3.48", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO CAD/CAM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-101-001", "path": "/courses/16052/sections/001", "id": "16052-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-101-001"]}, "comments": "This introduction to the modern mechanical design process is a project based course.
