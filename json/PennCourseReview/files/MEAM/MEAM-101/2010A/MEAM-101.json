Topics include: product definition (needfinding, observation, sketching, and brainstorming); computer-aided design (part creation, assemblies, and animation using SolidWorks); fundamental engineering design practices (material selection, dimensioning, tolerances, etc.); basic computer simulation and analysis; and rapid prototyping (laser cutter, 3-D fused-deposition modeling, and an introduction to computer-controlled machining). \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "INTRO TO MECH DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26352/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "2.49", "rReadingsValue": "2.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.76", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO MECH DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-101-001", "path": "/courses/26352/sections/001", "id": "26352-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-101-001"]}, "comments": "This is a hands-on, project-based course that covers the fundamentals of the modern mechanical design process, from needfinding and brainstorming to the basics of computerized manufacturing and rapid prototyping.

Some students felt that it \u201cwas a great course for mechanical engineers,\u201d and that the material was \u201cinteresting and relevant.\u201d Other students, however, disagreed and proclaimed that \u201cthere isn\u2019t a ton of actual class learning.\u201d The class spent a significant of their time on \u201cSolidworks models\u201d and many students felt there wasn\u2019t enough emphasis on theory.\r\n\r\nSome students praised Professor Fiene for his helpfulness. He would \u201ctake time to explain coursework,\u201d and he \u201cin general teaches an excellent course.\u201d Other students criticized him for being \u201cvery disorganized,\u201d claiming that \u201cdeadlines changed all the time,\u201d and that he would often cancel lectures.\r\n\r\nOverall, the majority of students believed that the workload for MEAM101 was extremely heavy. One student described the course as \u201clearning by trying and failing for many hours on Solidworks.\u201d The grading was not particularly harsh, but it was often \u201cunclear as to what grade one was getting at any point in the course.\u201d This course was recommended for Majors.
