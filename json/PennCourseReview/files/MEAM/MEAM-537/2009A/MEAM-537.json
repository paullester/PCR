{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4317"}, "description": "Engineering is progressing to ever smaller scales, enabling new technologies, materials, devices, and applications. Mechanics enters a new regime where the role of surfaces, interfaces, defects, material property variations, and quantum effects play more dominant roles. This course will provide an introduction to nano-scale mechanics and tribology at interfaces, and the critical role these topics play in the developing area of nanoscience and nanotechnology. We will discuss how mechanics and tribology at interfaces become integrated with the fields of materials science, chemistry, physics, and biology at this scale. We will cover a variety of concepts and applications, drawing connections to both established and new approaches. We will discuss the limits of continuum mechanics and present newly developed theories and experiments tailored to describe micro- and nano-scale phenomena. We will emphasize specific applications throughout the course. Literature reviews, critical peer discussion, individual and team problem assignments, and a peer reviewed literature research project will be assigned as part of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "NANOMECH & NANOTRIBOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16065/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "3.23", "rStimulateInterest": "3.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "2.85", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "2.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.08", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "NANOMECH & NANOTRIBOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-537-401", "path": "/courses/16065/sections/401", "id": "16065-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-537-401", "MSE-537-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/16065/sections/401/reviews/4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "CARPICK", "id": "4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "name": "ROBERT W.
