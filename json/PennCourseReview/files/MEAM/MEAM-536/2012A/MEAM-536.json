{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5440"}, "description": "This is an intermediate course that builds on the basic principles of Fluid Mechanics. The course provides a more in depth and unified framework to understand fluid flow at different time and length scales, in particular fiscous flows. Topics include review of basic concepts, conservation laws (momentum, mass, and heat), fluid kinematics, tensor analysis, Stokes' approximations, non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, and tubulence. The course will explore important modern topics such as microfluidics, swimming of micro-organisms, wind turbines, rheology, biofluid mechanics, and boundary layers. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "VISCOUS FLOWS & MOD APPS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27740/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.62", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "2.62", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "1.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.77", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "VISCOUS FLOWS & MOD APPS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-536-001", "path": "/courses/27740/sections/001", "id": "27740-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-536-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/27740/sections/001/reviews/4018-PAULO-E--ARRATIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4018-PAULO-E--ARRATIA", "first_name": "PAULO E.", "last_name": "ARRATIA", "id": "4018-PAULO-E--ARRATIA", "name": "PAULO E.
