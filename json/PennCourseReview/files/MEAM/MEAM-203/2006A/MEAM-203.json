{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1983"}, "description": "Thermodynamics is the study of the fundamental concepts underlying the conversion of energy in such mechanical systems as internal and external combustion engines (including automobile and aircraft engines), compressors, pumps, refrigerators, and turbines. This course is intended for students in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, physics and other fields. The topics include: Basic definitions, microscopic and macroscopic points of view; properties of pure substances and reversibility and irreversibility, the thermodynamic temperature scale, entropy, availability, second law analysis, power and refrigeration cycles and their engineering applications. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "THERMODYNAMICS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8014/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.10", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "THERMODYNAMICS I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-203-001", "path": "/courses/8014/sections/001", "id": "8014-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-203-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 55, "path": "/courses/8014/sections/001/reviews/1570-HAIM-H-BAU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1570-HAIM-H-BAU", "first_name": "HAIM H", "last_name": "BAU", "id": "1570-HAIM-H-BAU", "name": "HAIM H BAU"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "8014-001-1570-HAIM-H-BAU"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-203", "path": "/courses/8014", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8014/sections", "values": [{"name": "THERMODYNAMICS I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-203-001", "path": "/courses/8014/sections/001", "id": "8014-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-203-001"]}]}, "id": 8014, "aliases": ["MEAM-203"]}
