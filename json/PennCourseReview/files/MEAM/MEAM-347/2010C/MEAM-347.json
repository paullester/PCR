Many complained that the labs were extremely disorganized. Some stated that there were often not enough equipment and materials, and lab instructions were often changed, giving students \u201ca perverse incentive to start their projects at the last minute.\u201d Some students also felt that the quizzes were useless and proposed having homework corresponding to the labs instead. \r\n\r\nProfessor Yim was described by many as a helpful and approachable instructor. Students generally felt that it was convenient that the professor could be reached on gchat. However, many doubted that he had worked through the labs before they were assigned. Many students were unsatisfied with Professor Yim\u2019s explanation that the lack of lab materials was to simulate real world engineering problems. \r\n\r\nThe workload for this course was regarded by most students as being extremely heavy. Some students reported putting in more than 20 hours a week to finish assignments. According to many, the grading curve was harsh and did not reflect the amount of time and effort spent. Because of the difficulty and time required, this course is only recommended for majors.\r\n", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/23389/sections/001/reviews/3053-MARK-YIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3053-MARK-YIM", "first_name": "MARK", "last_name": "YIM", "id": "3053-MARK-YIM", "name": "MARK YIM"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "23389-001-3053-MARK-YIM"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.24", "rDifficulty": "3.27", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "2.82", "rCourseQuality": "1.97", "rWorkRequired": "3.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "1.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.42", "rCommAbility": "2.72", "rInstructorQuality": "3.14"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-347-001", "path": "/courses/23389/sections/001", "id": "23389-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-347-001"]}, "comments": "This course studies pressure, density, velocity, forces and introduces aerodynamics and aircraft performance. \r\n\r\nStudents generally enjoyed the class and found it to be fun.
