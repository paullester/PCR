{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3766"}, "description": "The course will focus on a few topics relevant to micro-fluidics and nano-technology. In particular, we will learn how the solid liquid interface acquires charge and the role that this charge plays in colloid stability, electroosmosis, and electrophoresis. Other topics will include controlled nano-assembly with dielectrophoresis, and stirring at very low Reynolds numbers (Lagrangian Chaos). The focus of the course will be on the physical phenomena from the continuum point of view. The mathematical complexity will be kept to a minimum. Software tools such as Maple and Femlab will be used throughout the course. The course will be reasonably self- contained and necessary background material will be provided consistent with the students' level of preparation. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "PHYSC HYDRDYN&INTRF PHEN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12115/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSC HYDRDYN&INTRF PHEN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-575-001", "path": "/courses/12115/sections/001", "id": "12115-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-575-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/12115/sections/001/reviews/1570-HAIM-H-BAU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1570-HAIM-H-BAU", "first_name": "HAIM H", "last_name": "BAU", "id": "1570-HAIM-H-BAU", "name": "HAIM H BAU"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "12115-001-1570-HAIM-H-BAU"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-575", "path": "/courses/12115", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12115/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSC HYDRDYN&INTRF PHEN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-575-001", "path": "/courses/12115/sections/001", "id": "12115-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-575-001"]}]}, "id": 12115, "aliases": ["MEAM-575"]}
