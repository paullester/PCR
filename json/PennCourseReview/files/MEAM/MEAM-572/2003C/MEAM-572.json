{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2341"}, "description": "As materials and devices shrink to the micro- and nanoscale, they transmit heat, light and electronic energy much differently than at the macroscopic length scales. This course provides a foundation for studying the transport of thermal,optical, and electronic energy from a microscopic perspective. Concepts from solid state physics and statistical mechanics will be introduced to analyze the influence of small characteristic dimensions on the propagatin of crystal vibratins, electrons, photons, and molecules. Applications to mdern microdevices and therometry techniques will be discussed. Topics to be covered include natural and fabricated microstructures, transport and scattering of phonons and electrons in solids, photon-phonon and photon-electron interactions, radiative recombinations, elementary kinetic theory, and the Boltzmann transport equation. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MICRO/NANOSCALE ENRG TRN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4395/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.88", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "MICRO/NANOSCALE ENRG TRN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-572-001", "path": "/courses/4395/sections/001", "id": "4395-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-572-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/4395/sections/001/reviews/1891-JENNIFER-R--LUKES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1891-JENNIFER-R--LUKES", "first_name": "JENNIFER R.", "last_name": "LUKES", "id": "1891-JENNIFER-R--LUKES", "name": "JENNIFER R.
