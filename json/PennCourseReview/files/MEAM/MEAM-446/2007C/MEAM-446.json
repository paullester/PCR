As an extension of MEAM 445, this course requires students to work individually or in groups to select projects in which they will learn design, development, and experimentation strategies under the supervision of a MEAM faculty advisor. The course also focuses on project planning, patent and library searches, and technical presentation.\r\n\r\nStudents were required to attend some lectures on statistics, but otherwise the course was mostly self-directed. Many complained that these lectures were unnecessary and irrelevant. Some noted that it was \u201cpoorly structured\u201d as well.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jeffcoat simply supervised the course. Students interacted with their advisors for the most part.\r\n\r\nThis course requires Junior standing to take, so is not open to underclassmen.
