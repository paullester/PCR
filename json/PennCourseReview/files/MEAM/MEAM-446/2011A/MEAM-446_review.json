As an extension of MEAM 445, this course requires students to work individually or in groups to select projects in which they will learn design, development, and experimentation strategies under the supervision of a MEAM faculty advisor. The course also focuses on project planning, patent and library searches, and technical presentation.&#8232;&#8232;Teams of five students work throughout their senior year on a design project of their choice. Students wished there was \u201cmore emphasis on obtaining good advisement and council at the outset of the project.\u201d Students commented that loose proposals made for a shaky foundation and resulted in a reduction in project scope. However, many felt this could have been fixed with more guidance and thought from the advisors about the feasibility of projects. &#8232;&#8232;Students referred to Dr. Jeffcoat as \u201cvery friendly\u201d and \u201calways willing to discuss team issues.\u201d The professor received glowing reviews from every student as a Senior Design course instructor.
