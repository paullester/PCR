{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1991"}, "description": "Mathematical modeling of mechanical design problems for optimization. Highlights and overview of optimization methods: unconstrained optimization, unidirectional search techniques, gradient, conjugate direction, and Newton methods. Constrained optimization. KKT optimality conditions, penalty formulations, augmented Lagrangians, and others. SLP and SQP and other approximate techniques for solving practical design problems. Monotonicity analysis and modeling of optimal design problems. Optimization of structural elements including shape and topology synthesis. Variational formulation of distributed and discrete parameter structures. Design criteria for stiffness and strength. Design sensitivity analysis. The course will include computer programs to implement the algorithms discussed and solve realistic design problems. A term project is required. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "OPT DESIGN OF MECH SYS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3228/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.31", "rRecommendMajor": "2.23", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "3.62", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.31", "rCommAbility": "2.54", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "OPT DESIGN OF MECH SYS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-540-001", "path": "/courses/3228/sections/001", "id": "3228-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-540-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/3228/sections/001/reviews/773-G-K--ANANTHASURESH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/773-G-K--ANANTHASURESH", "first_name": "G.K.", "last_name": "ANANTHASURESH", "id": "773-G-K--ANANTHASURESH", "name": "G.K.
