{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2871"}, "description": "This is a capstone design project course in mechanical engineering and is required of all mechanical engineering students. Students will be involved in selected group or individual projects emphasizing design, development, and experimentation, under the supervision of a MEAM faculty advisor. Projects are sponsored either by industry or by Penn professors. Alternatively, students may propose their own projects. Each project is approved by the instructor and the faculty advisor. The work is spread over MEAM 445 and MEAM 446. In addition to being involved in the design project, MEAM 445 covers project planning, patent and library searches, professional education, ethics, writing skills, communication, and technical presentation. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "MECH ENG DESIGN PROJECTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6821/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-445", "path": "/courses/6821", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6821/sections", "values": [{"name": "MECH ENG DESIGN PROJECTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-445-001", "path": "/courses/6821/sections/001", "id": "6821-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-445-001"]}]}, "id": 6821, "aliases": ["MEAM-445"]}
