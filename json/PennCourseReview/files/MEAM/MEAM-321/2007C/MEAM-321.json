{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/730"}, "description": "This course teaches the fundamental concepts underlying the dynamics of vibrations for single-degree of freedom, multi-degree and infinite-degree of freedom mechanical systems. The course will focus on Newton's Force Methods, Virtual-Work Methods, and Lagrange's Variation Methods for analyzing problems in vibrations. Students will learn how to analyze transient, steady state and forced motion of single and multi-degree of freedom linear and non-linear systems. The course teaches analytical solution techniques for linear systems and practical numerical and simulation methods for analysis and design of nonlinear systems. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "VIBRATION MECH SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13547/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.76", "rDifficulty": "3.48", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.86", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.48", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.72", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.28"}, "section": {"name": "VIBRATION MECH SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-321-001", "path": "/courses/13547/sections/001", "id": "13547-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-321-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/13547/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
