{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/730"}, "description": "This course teaches the fundamental concepts underlying the dynamics of vibrations for single-degree of freedom, multi-degree and infinite-degree of freedom mechanical systems. The course will focus on Newton's Force Methods, Virtual-Work Methods, and Lagrange's Variation Methods for analyzing problems in vibrations. Students will learn how to analyze transient, steady state and forced motion of single and multi-degree of freedom linear and non-linear systems. The course teaches analytical solution techniques for linear systems and practical numerical and simulation methods for analysis and design of nonlinear systems. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "VIBRATION MECH SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24721/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.40", "rDifficulty": "3.42", "rStimulateInterest": "1.65", "rRecommendMajor": "2.96", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.37", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.54", "rCommAbility": "2.46", "rInstructorQuality": "2.65"}, "section": {"name": "VIBRATION MECH SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-321-001", "path": "/courses/24721/sections/001", "id": "24721-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-321-001"]}, "comments": "This course teaches the fundamental concepts underlying the dynamics of\r\nvibrations for single-degree of freedom and multi-degree of freedom mechanical systems.\r\nThe course focuses on Newton's Force Methods, Virtual-Work Methods, and Lagrange's\r\nVariation Methods for analyzing problems in vibrations.
