{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/730"}, "description": "This course teaches the fundamental concepts underlying the dynamics of vibrations for single-degree of freedom, multi-degree and infinite-degree of freedom mechanical systems. The course will focus on Newton's Force Methods, Virtual-Work Methods, and Lagrange's Variation Methods for analyzing problems in vibrations. Students will learn how to analyze transient, steady state and forced motion of single and multi-degree of freedom linear and non-linear systems. The course teaches analytical solution techniques for linear systems and practical numerical and simulation methods for analysis and design of nonlinear systems. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "VIBRATION MECH SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/730/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "2.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.36", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "VIBRATION MECH SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-321-001", "path": "/courses/730/sections/001", "id": "730-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-321-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/730/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
