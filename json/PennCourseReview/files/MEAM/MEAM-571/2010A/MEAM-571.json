{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/734"}, "description": "The course deals with advanced topics in transport phenomena and is suitable for graduate students in mechanical, chemical and bioengineering who plan to pursue research in areas related to transport phenomena or work in an industrial setting that deals with transport issues. Topics include: Multi-component transport processes; Electrokinetic phenomena; Phase change at interfaces: Solidification, melting, condensation, evaporation, and combustion; Radiation heat transfer: properties of real surfaces, non-participating media, gray medium approximation, participating media transport, equation of radiative transfer, optically thin and thick limits, Monte-Carlo methods: Microscale energy transport in solids; microstructure, electrons, phonons, interactions of photons with electrons, phonons and surfaces; microscale radiation phenomena. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ADV TPCS/TRNSPT PHEN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26367/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.45", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.73", "rCommAbility": "2.64", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS/TRNSPT PHEN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-571-001", "path": "/courses/26367/sections/001", "id": "26367-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-571-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/26367/sections/001/reviews/4018-PAULO-E--ARRATIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4018-PAULO-E--ARRATIA", "first_name": "PAULO E.", "last_name": "ARRATIA", "id": "4018-PAULO-E--ARRATIA", "name": "PAULO E.
