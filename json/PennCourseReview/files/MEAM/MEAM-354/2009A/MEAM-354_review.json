Applications discussed include those from traditional engineering disciplines as well as newer areas such as biotechnology and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nSome students found this class to cover interesting ideas, though more described the content as \u201cdull\u201d or \u201cboring.\u201d Students also observed that significant overlap with material in MEAM 210 and a more theoretical treatment of content made the class seem less useful.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Purohit\u2019s teaching ability as \u201cexcellent\u201d and considered his lectures to be \u201cclear\u201d and \u201ceasy to understand.\u201d Many students also commented favorably on his availability, communication skills, and attempts to raise interest in the course material.\r\n\r\nStudents found this class to be somewhat difficult, especially with the cumulative nature of the material. A few students thought the work was considerable and that tests were challenging and graded harshly. Many desired more example problems in preparation for tests.", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/16061/sections/001/reviews/3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "first_name": "PRASHANT KISHORE", "last_name": "PUROHIT", "id": "3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "name": "PRASHANT KISHORE PUROHIT"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "16061-001-3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT"}]
