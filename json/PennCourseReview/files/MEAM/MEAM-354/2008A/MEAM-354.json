{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3448"}, "description": "This course builds on the fundamentals of solid mechanics taught in MEAM 210 and addresses more advanced problems in strength of materials. The students will be exposed to a wide array of applications from traditional engineering disciplines as well as emerging areas such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. The methods of analysis developed in this course will form the cornerstone of machine design and also more advanced topics in the mechanics of materials. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "MECHANICS OF SOLIDS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20486/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "2.76", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.35", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.94", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "MECHANICS OF SOLIDS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-354-001", "path": "/courses/20486/sections/001", "id": "20486-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-354-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/20486/sections/001/reviews/3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "first_name": "PRASHANT KISHORE", "last_name": "PUROHIT", "id": "3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "name": "PRASHANT KISHORE PUROHIT"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "20486-001-3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-354", "path": "/courses/20486", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20486/sections", "values": [{"name": "MECHANICS OF SOLIDS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-354-001", "path": "/courses/20486/sections/001", "id": "20486-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-354-001"]}]}, "id": 20486, "aliases": ["MEAM-354"]}
