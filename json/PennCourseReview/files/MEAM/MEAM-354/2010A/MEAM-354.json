Several students were disappointed with how the difficult concepts often masked the general practicality of the subject matter. Students generally agreed that the course moved too quickly and covered too much content, which made complete understanding of the concepts challenging.\r\n\r\nWhile many students praised Professor Purohit as \u201cthe most passionate professor I have encountered during my time at Penn.\u201d Many students also commented on his \u201cextremely high expectations for students,\u201d which some students appreciated as Professor Purohit would spend the time to work with students, although others translated into an \u201cintimidating\u201d and \u201cabrasive\u201d demeanor and an \u201capparent dislike for teaching this class.\u201d Comments on his teaching style were mixed with one student commenting on how Professor Purohit \u201cmakes this course extremely interesting, even when the material sometimes appears not to be\u201d while another commented on his \u201cincredibly dry lecture style.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents found the class as a \u201ctough course\u2026but definitely a challenging and rewarding one as well.\u201d Many students agreed that the exams were very difficult when compared to the rest of the course content. One student commented on the disconnect between the material covered in lecture, the homework assignments, and the exam: \u201cI attended every lecture, completed every homework assignment and felt comfortable with the material we covered but somehow felt entirely lost on the exams.\u201d Overall, students agreed that the course really \u201cneeds a recitation\u201d in order to adequately explain the fundamental concepts.
