{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1989"}, "description": "This course is an upper level course that discusses the behavior of materials, the selection of materials in mechanical components, and the mechanics of deformable bodies. It is intended for students interested in material science, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering. The topics covered include: Stress. Strain. Principal Stresses. Compatibility. Elastic stress-strain relations. Strain energy. Plane strain. Plane stress. Rods and trusses. Bending of beams. Torsion. Rotating disks. Castigliano's Theorem. Dummy loads. Principle of virtual work. The Rayleigh-Ritz Methods. Introduction to the finite element method. Non-linear material behavior. Yielding. Failure. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "MECHANICS OF MATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8022/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.30", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "MECHANICS OF MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-454-401", "path": "/courses/8022/sections/401", "id": "8022-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-454-401", "MEAM-554-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/8022/sections/401/reviews/1571-PEDRO-PONTE-CASTANEDA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1571-PEDRO-PONTE-CASTANEDA", "first_name": "PEDRO", "last_name": "PONTE-CASTANEDA", "id": "1571-PEDRO-PONTE-CASTANEDA", "name": "PEDRO PONTE-CASTANEDA"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "8022-401-1571-PEDRO-PONTE-CASTANEDA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-454", "path": "/courses/8022", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8022/sections", "values": [{"name": "MECHANICS OF MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-454-401", "path": "/courses/8022/sections/401", "id": "8022-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-454-401", "MEAM-554-401"]}]}, "id": 8022, "aliases": ["MEAM-454", "MEAM-554"]}
