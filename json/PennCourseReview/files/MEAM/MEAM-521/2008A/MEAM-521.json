{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3162"}, "description": "From numerical weather prediction and earthquake simulations, to quantum mechanics, and to genome sequencing and molecular dynamics, high-performance computing (HPC) is a fundamental tool for science. The basic principles on how to design, implement, and evaluate HPC techniques will be covered. Topics include parallel non-numerical and numerical algorithms, computing platforms, and message passing interface. Science applications will sample techniques applied to partial differential equations, many-body problems, and statistical physics. Practical problem-solving and hands-on examples will be a basic part of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "INTRO TO PARALLEL COMP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20489/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO PARALLEL COMP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-521-001", "path": "/courses/20489/sections/001", "id": "20489-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-521-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/20489/sections/001/reviews/2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "first_name": "GEORGE", "last_name": "BIROS", "id": "2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "name": "GEORGE BIROS"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "20489-001-2549-GEORGE-BIROS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-521", "path": "/courses/20489", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20489/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO PARALLEL COMP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-521-001", "path": "/courses/20489/sections/001", "id": "20489-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-521-001"]}]}, "id": 20489, "aliases": ["MEAM-521"]}
