{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3908"}, "description": "Visual Thinking is a drawing, creative thinking, and iterative prototyping course using a series of mechanical design projects to help move engineers, (and artists and others) out of the often analytical, even equation based comfort zones into the broader realm of unpredictable time constrained problem solving. This kind of problem solving sees \"solutions\" as a broad to infinite range of possibilities instead of as a single final predictable answer. Drawing is utilized both as a critical communication tool and as tangible speculation in the development of designs. Dozens of creative thinking strategies are implemented towards the accomplishment of 3 challenge projects, 2 of which are team work, and one individual. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "VISUAL THINKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13539/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "1.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.54", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-111-001", "path": "/courses/13539/sections/001", "id": "13539-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-111-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/13539/sections/001/reviews/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "first_name": "JENNIFER ELLEN", "last_name": "BUCK", "id": "3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "name": "JENNIFER ELLEN BUCK"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "13539-001-3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-111", "path": "/courses/13539", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13539/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-111-001", "path": "/courses/13539/sections/001", "id": "13539-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-111-001"]}]}, "id": 13539, "aliases": ["MEAM-111"]}
