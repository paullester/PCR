{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3907"}, "description": "This lecture course and a companion laboratory course (MEAM 147) build upon the concepts of Newtonian (classical) mechanics and their application to engineered systems. This course introduces students to mechanical principles that are the foundation of upper-level engineering courses including MEAM 210 and 211. The three major parts of this course are: I. Vector Mechanics; II. Statics and Structures; and III. Kinematics and Dynamics. Topics include: vector analysis, statics of rigid bodies, introduction to deformable bodies, friction, kinematics of motion, work and energy, and dynamics of particles. Case studies will be introduced, and the role of Newtonian mechanics in emerging applications including bio- and nano- technologies will be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTRO TO MECHANICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13538/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.40", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "1.84", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.72", "rReadingsValue": "2.16", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.44", "rCommAbility": "2.32", "rInstructorQuality": "2.20"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO MECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-110-001", "path": "/courses/13538/sections/001", "id": "13538-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-110-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/13538/sections/001/reviews/458-JOHN-L-BASSANI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/458-JOHN-L-BASSANI", "first_name": "JOHN L", "last_name": "BASSANI", "id": "458-JOHN-L-BASSANI", "name": "JOHN L BASSANI"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "13538-001-458-JOHN-L-BASSANI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-110", "path": "/courses/13538", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13538/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO MECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-110-001", "path": "/courses/13538/sections/001", "id": "13538-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-110-001"]}]}, "id": 13538, "aliases": ["MEAM-110"]}
