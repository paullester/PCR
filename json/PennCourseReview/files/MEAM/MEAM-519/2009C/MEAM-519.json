{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3910"}, "description": "This course is targeted to engineering students working in the areas on micro/nanomechanics of materials. The course will start with a quick review of the equations of linear elasticity and proceed to solutions of specific problems such as the Hertz contact problem, Eshelby's problem etc. Failure mechanisms such as fracture and the fundamentals of dislocations/plasticity will also be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ELAST&MICROMECH OF MATLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17677/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "ELAST&MICROMECH OF MATLS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-519-401", "path": "/courses/17677/sections/401", "id": "17677-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-519-401", "MSE-550-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/17677/sections/401/reviews/3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "first_name": "PRASHANT KISHORE", "last_name": "PUROHIT", "id": "3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT", "name": "PRASHANT KISHORE PUROHIT"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "17677-401-3364-PRASHANT-KISHORE-PUROHIT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-519", "path": "/courses/17677", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17677/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELAST&MICROMECH OF MATLS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-519-401", "path": "/courses/17677/sections/401", "id": "17677-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-519-401", "MSE-550-401"]}]}, "id": 17677, "aliases": ["MEAM-519", "MSE-550"]}
