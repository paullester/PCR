Recent examples include planetary rovers, robotic pets, medical surgical-assistive devices, and semi-autonomous search- and-rescue vehicles. This introductory-level course presents the fundamental kinematic, dynamic, and computational principles underlying most modern robotic systems. The main topics of the course include: coordinate transformations, manipulator kinematics, mobile-robot kinematics, actuation and sensing, feedback control, vision, and motion planning. The material is reinforced with hands-on lab exercises including robot-arm control and the programming of vision-guided mobile robots.\r\n\r\nStudents overall felt that the course was \u201cgood hands on learning\u201d and \u201cexciting.\u201d The \u201cproject style\u201d of the course helped students with \u201creinforcing concepts,\u201d but some students felt that \u201cMore emphasis on theoretical aspects would be nice.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Fiene\u2019s teaching style was to \u201cshow some really simple outlines\u201d without going \u201cthrough details.\u201d Most students felt \u201cMore guidance would\u2019ve been appreciated.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents overall felt that \u201cthe requirement for programming is pretty high.\u201d  Some commented that though the class was \u201cfun,\u201d the time requirement and necessary knowledge could \u201ccreate conflicts\u201d especially for undergraduates.\r\n", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/27739/sections/001/reviews/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "FIENE", "id": "3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "name": "JONATHAN FIENE"}, "num_reviewers": 49, "id": "27739-001-3916-JONATHAN-FIENE"}]
