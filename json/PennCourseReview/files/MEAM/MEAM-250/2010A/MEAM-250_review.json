Through a personal energy audit, students are made aware of the extensive role that energy plays in modern life, both directly, through electricity and transportation fuel, and indirectly in the manufacturing of goods they use. The course covers how that energy is supplied, the anticipated global growth in energy demand, the resource availability and the role of science and technology in meeting that demand in a world concerned about climate change. The roles of conservation, improved efficiency and renewable energy in meeting future demand in a sustainable, environmentally benign way are covered.\r\n\r\nOverall, students found the course material \u201cvery interesting.\u201d Many thought that the \u201cthorough overview of all energy sources: conventional and renewable\u201d and the \u201ccomprehensive analysis of technologies and economical [factors]\u201d showed them the importance and relevance of energy systems, resources, and technologies. As such, many students reported learning a lot from this class. Although some students thought that too much emphasis was placed on the policies rather than the technologies.\r\n\r\nStudents thought that the class was taught \u201cvery well\u201d as Professor Jackson shared his \u201cknowledge,\u201d \u201cexperience,\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive analysis.\u201d Although many students described Professor Jackson as \u201ckind, friendly, and approachable,\u201d other students felt that his lectures occasionally fell flat. Some students wished there was more \u201cstudent-teacher interaction\u201d within the lecture.\r\n\r\nMany students commented on the difficulty of having homework due on the same day as quizzes. One student remarked that the \u201cquizzes [seemed] a little hard and the grading [was] a little harsh.\u201d Overall, the course is recommended to those in engineering as a course to survey the policies surrounding the energy systems, resources, and technology.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 8 student comments which were submitted.
