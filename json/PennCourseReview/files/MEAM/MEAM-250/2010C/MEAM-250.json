{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4870"}, "description": "The course will present a comprehensive overview of the global demand for energy, and the resource availability and technology used in its current and future supply. Through a personal energy audit, students will be made aware of the extensive role that energy plays in modern life, both directly, through electricity and transportation fuel, and indirectly in the manufacturing of goods they use. The course will cover how that energy is supplied, the anticipated global growth in energy demand, the resource availability and the role of science and technology in meeting that demand in a world concerned about climate change. The roles of conservation, improved efficiency and renewable energy in meeting future demand in a sustainable, environmentally benign way will be covered. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ENERGY SYS, RES & TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23386/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "1.95", "rRecommendMajor": "2.82", "rCourseQuality": "2.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "ENERGY SYS, RES & TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-250-001", "path": "/courses/23386/sections/001", "id": "23386-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-250-001"]}, "comments": "The course presents a comprehensive overview of the global demand for energy, and the resource availability and technology used in its current and future supply.

One student commented that the course was \u201chelpful for showing the past, present, and future of world energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students agreed that homework assignments were \u201cwell-designed\u201d and \u201cclosely related to the real life,\u201d resulting in the development of important analytical skills. Students reported that there were quizzes and homework assignments every week, making the word load very heavy. Students also generally felt that quizzes and tests were harshly graded, with little to no partial credit given.\r\n", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/23386/sections/001/reviews/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "name": "ANDREW JACKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "23386-001-5231-ANDREW-JACKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-250", "path": "/courses/23386", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23386/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENERGY SYS, RES & TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-250-001", "path": "/courses/23386/sections/001", "id": "23386-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-250-001"]}]}, "id": 23386, "aliases": ["MEAM-250"]}
