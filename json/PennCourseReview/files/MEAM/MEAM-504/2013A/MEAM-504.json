{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5439"}, "description": "The course will compreshensively cover both theorectical and practical tribology, the science and technology of interacting surfaces in relative motion. The various modes of lubrication, hydrodynamic, elastohydradynamic, hydrostatic, mixed, solid and dry, will be studied in detail. The contact between solid surfaces will be covered, leading to an understanding of friction and various modes of wear. At each stage, it will be shown how the tribological principles learned can be applied in practice to improve the efficiency and durability of mechanical equipment and thereby enhance sustainability through energy and materials conservation. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "TRIBOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30607/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rTAQuality": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "2.21", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.39", "rWorkRequired": "1.96", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "TRIBOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-504-001", "path": "/courses/30607/sections/001", "id": "30607-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-504-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/30607/sections/001/reviews/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "name": "ANDREW JACKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "30607-001-5231-ANDREW-JACKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-504", "path": "/courses/30607", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30607/sections", "values": [{"name": "TRIBOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-504-001", "path": "/courses/30607/sections/001", "id": "30607-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-504-001"]}]}, "id": 30607, "aliases": ["MEAM-504"]}
