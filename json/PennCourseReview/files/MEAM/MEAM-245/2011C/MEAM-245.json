Aircraft performance, aircraft stability and control, and aircraft\r\npropulsion were also covered.\r\nThis course was an informative introduction class to aeronautical engineering. A\r\nstudent stated that they \u201cgot a lot out of the course\u201d There were complaints about the\r\ntextbook, which was \u201cseemingly filled with \u2018historical\u2019 information, [but] rather dry with\r\ntechnical details [of theories]\u201d.\r\nProfessor Kothmann is highly praised as a teacher who wants his students to\r\nsucceed. Kothmann is also respected for his experience as an engineer in the aviation\r\nindustry, covering \u201cmany ideas and topics pertaining to flight while not getting too\r\ndetailed or complicated to understand.\u201d Students highly appreciated his accessibility, his\r\nwillingness to help students understanding the material, and his prompt replies to emails.\r\nThis class is meant for and highly recommended for sophomores in the\r\nmechanical engineering department. However, non-majors could keep up, but\r\nknowledge of Math 240 is highly recommended. A student said, \u201cI expected a course\r\nthat provided an introduction to broad topics in mechanical engineering within the\r\ncontext of flight, and that's exactly what I got.\u201d", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/24718/sections/001/reviews/3294-BRUCE-D--KOTHMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3294-BRUCE-D--KOTHMANN", "first_name": "BRUCE D.", "last_name": "KOTHMANN", "id": "3294-BRUCE-D--KOTHMANN", "name": "BRUCE D.
