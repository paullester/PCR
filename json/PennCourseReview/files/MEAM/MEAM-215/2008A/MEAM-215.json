{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3159"}, "description": "This course introduces the broad field of mechanical design, in which engineering science and inventive thinking are combined to solve real-world problems.Many of the tools, techniques, materials, and devices required for practical applications are covered, with emphasis on how to intelligently select and employ them. Topics include modern design methods (simulation, graphics, ergonomics, etc), manufacturing processes (machining, casting, automation, etc), and physical components (bearings, gears, pumps, motors, etc). Students receive a comprehensive technological grounding which, in conjunction with theoretical and specialized knowledge, will empower them to produce creative and practicable new designs. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "ELEMENTS OF MECH ENG DSG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20481/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.73", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "1.36", "rRecommendMajor": "1.91", "rCourseQuality": "1.36", "rWorkRequired": "1.91", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "1.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.82", "rCommAbility": "2.09", "rInstructorQuality": "2.09"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTS OF MECH ENG DSG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-215-001", "path": "/courses/20481/sections/001", "id": "20481-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-215-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/20481/sections/001/reviews/2438-ROBERT-L--JEFFCOAT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2438-ROBERT-L--JEFFCOAT", "first_name": "ROBERT L.", "last_name": "JEFFCOAT", "id": "2438-ROBERT-L--JEFFCOAT", "name": "ROBERT L.
