{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2870"}, "description": "In many modern systems, mechanical elements are tightly coupled with electronic components and embedded computers. Mechatronics is the study of how these domains are interconnected, and this hands-on, project-based course provides an integrated introduction to the fundamental components within each of the three domains, including: mechanical elements (prototyping, materials, actuators and sensors, transmissions, and fundamental kinematics), electronics(basic circuits, filters, op amps, discrete logic, and interfacing with mechanical elements), and computing (interfacing with the analog world, microprocessor technology, basic control theory, and programming). \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "DSGN OF MECHATRONIC SYS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10683/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "3.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.95", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "3.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.48", "rReadingsValue": "1.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.45", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.32"}, "section": {"name": "DSGN OF MECHATRONIC SYS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-410-401", "path": "/courses/10683/sections/401", "id": "10683-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-410-401", "MEAM-510-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/10683/sections/401/reviews/3053-MARK-YIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3053-MARK-YIM", "first_name": "MARK", "last_name": "YIM", "id": "3053-MARK-YIM", "name": "MARK YIM"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "10683-401-3053-MARK-YIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-410", "path": "/courses/10683", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10683/sections", "values": [{"name": "DSGN OF MECHATRONIC SYS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-410-401", "path": "/courses/10683/sections/401", "id": "10683-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-410-401", "MEAM-510-401"]}]}, "id": 10683, "aliases": ["MEAM-410", "MEAM-510"]}
