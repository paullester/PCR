Mechatronics is the study of how these domains are interconnected, and this hands-on, project-based course provides an integrated introduction to the fundamental components within each of the three domains, including: mechanical elements (prototyping, materials, actuators and sensors, transmissions, and fundamental kinematics), electronics(basic circuits, filters, op amps, discrete logic, and interfacing with mechanical elements), and computing (interfacing with the analog world, microprocessor technology, basic control theory, and programming).\r\n\r\nThis course was applauded as \u201ca mix of theory and a great hands-on component.\u201d This class was considered \u201ca great way to delve into prototyping and programming of applied mechatronic systems,\u201d and a \u201ccapstone course to take for any engineer, because it involves so many interdisciplinary skills from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and robotics.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Fiene was described as \u201cunparalleled in his teaching abilities in engineering,\u201d and students noted that he \u201cgenuinely cares about each and every student and their learning.\u201d He was a very accessible and helpful resource.\r\n\r\nStudents found this course very time consuming but found the time spent \u201cworthwhile\u201d and generally had \u201ca lot of fun\u201d leading up to the final competition. \r\n\r\n", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/17674/sections/401/reviews/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "FIENE", "id": "3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "name": "JONATHAN FIENE"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "17674-401-3916-JONATHAN-FIENE"}]
