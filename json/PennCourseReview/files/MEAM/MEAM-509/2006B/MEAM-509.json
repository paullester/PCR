{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3563"}, "description": "This course considers normal human movement (especially grasping, reaching, walking, and running), pathological conditions (e.g., resulting from disease, injury, malformations), and engineering approaches such as prostheses (limb replacements) and orthoses (limb assists) that may ameliorate the conditions and promote normal movements and function. In doing so, we will also learn musculoskeletal anatomy, comparative anatomy, muscle mechanics, and neural control. An objective of the course is to bring together technical analysis and synthesis skills of students with the practical problems of persons disabled by amputation, stroke, spinal cord injury, and other causes. The potential problems of applying engineering techniques to human beings will be emphasized. Engineering design comprises that are necessary are also given emphasis. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "MECH OF HUMAN MOTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9791/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-509", "path": "/courses/9791", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9791/sections", "values": [{"name": "MECH OF HUMAN MOTION", "sectionnum": "901", "primary_alias": "MEAM-509-901", "path": "/courses/9791/sections/901", "id": "9791-901", "aliases": ["MEAM-509-901"]}]}, "id": 9791, "aliases": ["MEAM-509"]}
