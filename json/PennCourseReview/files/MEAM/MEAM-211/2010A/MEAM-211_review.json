These concepts are also fundamental to the modeling and analysis of human movement, biomechanics, animation of synthetic human models and robotics. The topics covered include: Particle dynamics using energy and momentum methods of analysis; Dynamics of systems of particles; Impact; Systems of variable mass; Kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion; Computer-aided dynamic simulation and animation.\r\n\r\nThe course was described to be extremely \u201cenjoyable\u201d and \u201ceducational.\u201d Furthermore, the material seemed to incorporate much more than what was taught in lecture. As well, a significant portion of the coursework was done in MatLab, which was \u201cfrustrating, but useful\u201d for some students.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Kuchenbecker as \u201cone of the best professors at Penn.\u201d She \u201creally cares about her students,\u201d and is always \u201cwilling to help.\u201d In addition, students felt that she was extremely \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201cstimulating,\u201d so she was able to keep the students\u2019 interest throughout the lecture. She really enjoys what she teaches and she is \u201cpassionate about the subject.\u201d Overall, students really enjoyed having Professor Kuchenbecker teaching the course.\r\n\r\nThe workload for this course was considered to be quite heavy. This is partially because almost every assignment incorporated MatLab in some way, which requires a lot of time commitment. Students say that \u201cspending a lot of time on homework and studying really pays off.\u201d The course was recommended for both Majors and Non-majors.
