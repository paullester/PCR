{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1984"}, "description": "This course is intended for students in mechanical engineering, civil-systems, materials science, and other fields. It continues the treatment of the statics of rigid bodies begun in Physics 150 and MEAM 110 and leads to the treatment of deformable bodies and their response to loads. The concepts of stress, strain, and linearly elastic response are introduced and they are applied to the behavior of rods, beams, shafts and pressure valves. Safety factors and the onset of mechanical failure are discussed. The course incorporates the use of computers to solve problems, and includes a written library research assignment and a team design project. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "STATICS & STRENTH OF MAT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4390/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.97", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "1.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "2.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.27", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.17"}, "section": {"name": "STATICS & STRENTH OF MAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-210-001", "path": "/courses/4390/sections/001", "id": "4390-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-210-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/4390/sections/001/reviews/458-JOHN-L-BASSANI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/458-JOHN-L-BASSANI", "first_name": "JOHN L", "last_name": "BASSANI", "id": "458-JOHN-L-BASSANI", "name": "JOHN L BASSANI"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "4390-001-458-JOHN-L-BASSANI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-210", "path": "/courses/4390", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4390/sections", "values": [{"name": "STATICS & STRENTH OF MAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-210-001", "path": "/courses/4390/sections/001", "id": "4390-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-210-001"]}]}, "id": 4390, "aliases": ["MEAM-210"]}
