It continues the treatment of the statics of rigid bodies begun in Physics 150 and MEAM 110 and leads to the treatment of deformable bodies and their response to loads. The concepts of stress, strain, and linearly elastic response are introduced and they are applied to the behavior of rods, beams, shafts and pressure valves. Safety factors and the onset of mechanical failure are discussed. The course incorporates the use of computers to solve problems, and includes a written library research assignment and a team design project. \r\n\r\nStudents reported that this course had an extremely heavy emphasis on the textbook. According to most, many examples in class were simply \u201crewrites of example problems from the book (that are already solved).\u201d Several students agreed that some of the material was unclear and that it was \u201chard to focus in class.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Jackson was criticized by some students as being neither \u201chelpful nor interested in the course.\u201d According to several, his lectures were \u201cstraight from the book,\u201d and students felt that his style was not very engaging. On the other hand, some students said that Professor Jackson had a very thorough understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nOverall, students reported that this course was heavily dependent on the textbook. Some stated that quizzes relied \u201ctoo heavily upon visualizing 3D space rather than the material in class.\u201d Some students said that it was \u201cdifficult to succeed in this class\u201d because the book was \u201cmediocre\u201d and the professor would only cover what was in the book. This course was recommended for majors only.\r\n", "num_students": 63, "path": "/courses/23383/sections/001/reviews/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "name": "ANDREW JACKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 57, "id": "23383-001-5231-ANDREW-JACKSON"}]
