It continues the treatment of the statics of rigid bodies begun in Physics 150 and MEAM 110 and leads to the treatment of deformable bodies and their response to loads. The concepts of stress, strain, and linearly elastic response are introduced and they are applied to the behavior of rods, beams, shafts and pressure valves. Safety factors and the onset of mechanical failure are discussed. The course incorporates the use of computers to solve problems, and includes a written library research assignment and a team design project. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "STATICS & STRENTH OF MAT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17667/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "3.18", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.28", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "3.49", "rInstructorAccess": "2.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.65", "rCommAbility": "2.63", "rInstructorQuality": "2.31"}, "section": {"name": "STATICS & STRENTH OF MAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-210-001", "path": "/courses/17667/sections/001", "id": "17667-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-210-001"]}, "comments": "This course is intended for students in mechanical engineering, civil-systems, materials science, and other fields.

Some students were dissatisfied that there were almost no real-life examples, and imagine this would cause \u201cdifficulty applying this knowledge to any practical situation.\u201d While some students felt that this class \u201creaffirmed\u201d their desire to be a MEAM major, others considered it the \u201cdiscouraging.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents called the teaching staff \u201cstubborn\u201d and their grading techniques \u201charsh and irrational.\u201d Some accused Professor Carpick of \u201cforcing everyone to learn the same way\u201d by requiring all students to print out and fill in the blanks on his notes, and some called him \u201cinflexible and unaccommodating.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents complained of unfair, uncurved, \u201cridiculous\u201d grading and noticed points taken off their work for \u201cinsignificant things.\u201d PHYS 150 or MEAM 110/147 are prerequisites. MATH 240 and MEAM 247 are strongly recommended as corequisites. \r\n", "num_students": 66, "path": "/courses/17667/sections/001/reviews/4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "CARPICK", "id": "4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "name": "ROBERT W.
