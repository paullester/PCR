Key concepts of stress, strain, and linearly elastic responses are applied to different forms, as well as a discussion of safety factors and features.\r\n\r\nLecture is necessary and enjoyable. The professor was considered to be extremely engaging and knowledgable.\r\n\r\nMajor projects include a library research project as well as a team design project. Grading is not on a curve, which led students to comment that the final project was too large of a proportion of the grade. Most students enjoyed the class, but felt that the difficulty of the class merited a curve, which would balance out the currently uneven grade distribution.", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/18955/sections/001/reviews/4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "CARPICK", "id": "4017-ROBERT-W--CARPICK", "name": "ROBERT W.
