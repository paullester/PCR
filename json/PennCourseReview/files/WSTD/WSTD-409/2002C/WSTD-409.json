{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2187"}, "description": "The course will examine the complex process of mainstreaming women's history into American public culture. We will work with both primary and secondary sources from women's and preservation history, public policy, material culture, and cultural resource management. Case studies from historic sites, house museums, and history museum exhibitions will be highlighted. Examples will include the Women's Rights National Historic Park at Seneca Falls, Walker building (Madame C.J. Walker), Hull House (Jane Adams), and Paulsdale (childhood home of Alice Paul). The re-installation of the First Ladies Hall at the Museum of American History (Smithsonian) will be a key illustration of the challenges women's history confronts in the context of collection development and exhibition. We will focus on two problematic issues: 1)the critical role women played in saving some key historical sites and 2)the interpretation of women's history at traditional male sites such as Mt. Vernon, The Alamo, Frederick Douglas Home and Pennsbury Manor \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SEC FUTURE/WOMEN'S PAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3633/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "SEC FUTURE/WOMEN'S PAST", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "WSTD-409-640", "path": "/courses/3633/sections/640", "id": "3633-640", "aliases": ["WSTD-409-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/3633/sections/640/reviews/1772-CYNTHIA-J--LITTLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1772-CYNTHIA-J--LITTLE", "first_name": "CYNTHIA J.", "last_name": "LITTLE", "id": "1772-CYNTHIA-J--LITTLE", "name": "CYNTHIA J.
