{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2439"}, "description": "Middle Eastern women have long been a subject of great fascination to outsiders whose popular image is generally reduced to two extreme dimensions: one, veiled and oppressed, enthrenched in domestic chores and living a life of seclusion from public sphere. The other, emancipated, professional, and actively engaged in public life, not too dissimilar in life style to western women. The social realities are, however, far from both stereotypes. The Middle Eastern women live in a complex world balanced by work, Islamic law and patriarchal family structure. This course is an introduction to an anthropological perspective on Islamic women in the Arab and non-Arab Middle East. Discussion of key issues and concepts include: what exactly is a Middle Eastern Woman, tradition versus modernity, the \"language\" of dress, its connection to honor and modesty. Is the veil a source of protection of virtue? Does women's labor affect gender roles and relations? These issues and others will be contextualized and compared cross-culturally, using ethnographic and historical sources from Egypt, Turkey and Iran with references to other Middle Eastern and Central Asian cultures. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "WOMEN/GENDER IN MIDDLE E", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4829/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN/GENDER IN MIDDLE E", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "WSTD-129-601", "path": "/courses/4829/sections/601", "id": "4829-601", "aliases": ["WSTD-129-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/4829/sections/601/reviews/1251-AYSE-GURSAN-SALZMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1251-AYSE-GURSAN-SALZMANN", "first_name": "AYSE", "last_name": "GURSAN-SALZMANN", "id": "1251-AYSE-GURSAN-SALZMANN", "name": "AYSE GURSAN-SALZMANN"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "4829-601-1251-AYSE-GURSAN-SALZMANN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "WSTD-129", "path": "/courses/4829", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4829/sections", "values": [{"name": "WOMEN/GENDER IN MIDDLE E", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "WSTD-129-601", "path": "/courses/4829/sections/601", "id": "4829-601", "aliases": ["WSTD-129-601"]}]}, "id": 4829, "aliases": ["WSTD-129"]}
