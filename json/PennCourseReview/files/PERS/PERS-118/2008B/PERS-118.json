{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4774"}, "description": "Course description: This intensive course is intended for highly self-motivated and dedicated students who wish to work toward improving their Persian proficiency in all four skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. We will try to expand our vocabulary, fine-tune our grammar, and deepen competencies in the four skills. We will work across literary genres and contemporary media to analyze and interpret cultural, political and historical moments in Persian speaking countries; Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikstan. Every day we will read Modern and Classical Persian prose and poetry, as well as readings from Persian media and historical texts. Students are required to produce written compositions regularly. In the course of the summer session, we will screen two Iranian movies per week, and discuss them subsequently. The class will take field trips to related cultural areas and Persian restaurants in New York, Washington D.C. and the Philadelphia area. \n\n", "semester": "2008B", "name": "INTEN ADV PERSIAN I&II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19628/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTEN ADV PERSIAN I&II", "sectionnum": "980", "primary_alias": "PERS-118-980", "path": "/courses/19628/sections/980", "id": "19628-980", "aliases": ["PERS-118-980", "PERS-618-980"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/19628/sections/980/reviews/2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR", "first_name": "PARDIS", "last_name": "MINUCHEHR", "id": "2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR", "name": "PARDIS MINUCHEHR"}, "num_reviewers": 1, "id": "19628-980-2035-PARDIS-MINUCHEHR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PERS-118", "path": "/courses/19628", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19628/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEN ADV PERSIAN I&II", "sectionnum": "980", "primary_alias": "PERS-118-980", "path": "/courses/19628/sections/980", "id": "19628-980", "aliases": ["PERS-118-980", "PERS-618-980"]}]}, "id": 19628, "aliases": ["PERS-118", "PERS-618"]}
