He was \"highly accessible, very friendly, and very knowledgeable.\" He \"did a good job of stimulating class interest.\" However, some students criticized his emphasis on the theoretical aspects of statistics rather than computation.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the \"rigor of the exams and problem sets was very appropriate.\" \r\nHomework was due once a week. For the most part, students found the course easy and the textbook unnecessary. \r\n", "num_students": 91, "path": "/courses/25158/sections/001/reviews/206-WARREN-J--EWENS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/206-WARREN-J--EWENS", "first_name": "WARREN J.", "last_name": "EWENS", "id": "206-WARREN-J--EWENS", "name": "WARREN J.
