Some of the following material is covered: data displays and summary statistics for quantitative and qualitative variables; correlation and simple regression for pairs of variables; probability as a measure of uncertainty and as limiting relative frequency; the law of large numbers; the normal distribution and the central limit theorem; statistical inference based on standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical hypothesis tests. The course does not dwell on the details of computation\u2014its main focus is on understanding a few deep concepts and interpreting data and statistical results.\r\n\r\nStudents widely agreed that \u201cthe class [spent] too much time focused on how to use the R software rather than on actual statistics.\u201d  The professor presented R code during class, which almost all students found boring and \u201cdifficult to follow,\u201d especially since they were not allowed to use their laptops to follow along.  A lot of students felt that the focus on R code \u201c[made] it difficult to grasp the actual concept[s],\u201d and several mentioned that lectures were \u201cineffective.\u201d  A number of students also mentioned that the overly heavy focus on R extended to the homework assignments; all the comments about the homework noted that the focus on R coding made it time-consuming and difficult.  In the end, many students tried to learn the material independently.  While some found independent learning difficult due to a lack of lecture notes beyond the text files containing R code that were presented in class, the few students who attended office hours said they were \u201cvery useful.\u201d  \r\n\r\nOn average, students found Professor Buja to be \u201cpersonable\u201d and \u201capproachable\u201d but most believed he \u201c[did] not do a good job of communicating with students\u201d during lecture.  In contrast, the students who commented on office hours felt that Professor Buja was \u201cvery helpful\u201d in that setting.    \r\n\r\nAlmost all students felt that the focus on R made the course difficult.  Students who were less comfortable with R found the homework, which was based on R, to be challenging and warned that it \u201c[could] take a long time to do.\u201d  Students also felt that the exams were disjointed from the class as they did not test R; some found it \u201cdifficult to distill [from the lectures] what statistics information\u2026[was] necessary for the tests.\u201d  Statistics 101 is part of the Wharton core.
