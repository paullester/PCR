Multiple students commented that lecture notes and exams often had typos, and that Professor Zhang would sometimes write down incorrect equations on the board.

As a result, many students commented that the exams were \u201cdifficult,\u201d even though cheat sheets were allowed. Students also commented that most of the quizzes were in the last half of the semester, which made the workload uneven. STAT 102 is required for Wharton students. The prerequisite is STAT 101.
