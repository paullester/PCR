{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5168"}, "description": "This course introduces statistical ideas as they apply to managers. It is designed for students with no prior experience with statistical analysis. Two key ideas dominate the material: summarizing and describing data, and modeling variability and randomness using probability models. The focus of the presentation is on understanding the rationale for modern statistical methods and developing critical judgment in the use of these methods. Extensive use of computer software replaces much of the standard demand for calculation and frees time for interpretation and evaluation. Topics covered in the course include: randomness and variability, graphical summarization, quality control, probability, sampling, estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "BASIC BUSINESS STATISTIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25170/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.48", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "2.39", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "1.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.52", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.70", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "BASIC BUSINESS STATISTIC", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "STAT-603-002", "path": "/courses/25170/sections/002", "id": "25170-002", "aliases": ["STAT-603-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/25170/sections/002/reviews/5686-EDWARD-I-GEORGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5686-EDWARD-I-GEORGE", "first_name": "EDWARD I", "last_name": "GEORGE", "id": "5686-EDWARD-I-GEORGE", "name": "EDWARD I GEORGE"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "25170-002-5686-EDWARD-I-GEORGE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STAT-603", "path": "/courses/25170", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25170/sections", "values": [{"name": "BASIC BUSINESS STATISTIC", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "STAT-603-002", "path": "/courses/25170/sections/002", "id": "25170-002", "aliases": ["STAT-603-002"]}]}, "id": 25170, "aliases": ["STAT-603"]}
