{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5600"}, "description": "This is a course that prepares PhD students in statistics for research in multivariate statistics and data visualization. The emphasis will be on a deep conceptual understanding of multivariate methods to the point where students will propose variations and extensions to existing methods or whole new approaches to problems previously solved by classical methods. Topics include: principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, generalized canonical analysis; nonlinear extensions of multivariate methods based on optimal transformations of quantitative variables and optimal scaling of categorical variables; shrinkage- and sparsity-based extensions to classical methods; clustering methods of the k-means and hierarchical varieties; multidimensional scaling, graph drawing, and manifold estimation. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "MULTIVARIATE ANALY: METH: Multivariate Analysis: Methodology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29712/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "1.62", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.54", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "MULTIVARIATE ANALY: METH: Multivariate Analysis: Methodology", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-926-001", "path": "/courses/29712/sections/001", "id": "29712-001", "aliases": ["STAT-926-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/29712/sections/001/reviews/1166-ANDREAS-BUJA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1166-ANDREAS-BUJA", "first_name": "ANDREAS", "last_name": "BUJA", "id": "1166-ANDREAS-BUJA", "name": "ANDREAS BUJA"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "29712-001-1166-ANDREAS-BUJA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STAT-926", "path": "/courses/29712", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29712/sections", "values": [{"name": "MULTIVARIATE ANALY: METH: Multivariate Analysis: Methodology", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-926-001", "path": "/courses/29712/sections/001", "id": "29712-001", "aliases": ["STAT-926-001"]}]}, "id": 29712, "aliases": ["STAT-926"]}
