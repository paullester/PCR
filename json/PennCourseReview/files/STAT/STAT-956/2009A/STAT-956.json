The course will address both theoretical and empirical issues. Extensive use will be made of the S-Plus Statistical Language, but no previous experience of S-Plus will be required. The course begins with a quick review of ARIMA models. Most of the course is devoted to ARCH, GARCH, threshold, switching Markov, state space, and nonlinear models. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "FIN & ECON TIME SERIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16510/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.90", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.90", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.30", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "FIN & ECON TIME SERIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-956-001", "path": "/courses/16510/sections/001", "id": "16510-001", "aliases": ["STAT-956-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/16510/sections/001/reviews/1750-J--MICHAEL-STEELE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1750-J--MICHAEL-STEELE", "first_name": "J.
