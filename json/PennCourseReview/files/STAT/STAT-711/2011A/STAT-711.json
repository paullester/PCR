{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5049"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the wide range of techniques available for statistical forecasting. Qualitative techniques, smoothing and decomposition of time series, regression, adaptive methods, autoregressive-moving average modeling, and ARCH and GARCH formulations will be surveyed. The emphasis will be on applications, rather than technical foundations and derivations. The techniques will be studied critically, with examination of their usefulness and limitations. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "FORECASTING METHODS MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22479/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.19", "rRecommendMajor": "3.16", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.47", "rCommAbility": "2.72", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "FORECASTING METHODS MGMT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STAT-711-401", "path": "/courses/22479/sections/401", "id": "22479-401", "aliases": ["STAT-711-401", "STAT-435-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/22479/sections/401/reviews/2362-PAUL-SHAMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2362-PAUL-SHAMAN", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "SHAMAN", "id": "2362-PAUL-SHAMAN", "name": "PAUL SHAMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "22479-401-2362-PAUL-SHAMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STAT-711", "path": "/courses/22479", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22479/sections", "values": [{"name": "FORECASTING METHODS MGMT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STAT-711-401", "path": "/courses/22479/sections/401", "id": "22479-401", "aliases": ["STAT-711-401", "STAT-435-401"]}]}, "id": 22479, "aliases": ["STAT-711", "STAT-435"]}
