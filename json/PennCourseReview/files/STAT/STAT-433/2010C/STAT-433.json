Students enjoyed the lectures once the basic processes were finished, but urged that this class required, \u201ca tremendous amount of work and thinking to master.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents agreed that Professor Shepp was \u201cincredibly brilliant\u201d and \u201cvery elegant,\u201d but also were concerned that he \u201ccannot clearly convey the material.\u201d They suspect this is because he is used to teaching graduate students, and also wish that Professor Shepp would have \u201cstuck more to the textbook\u201d than his own notes. However, students did find Professor Shepp \u201cmotivating\u201d and \u201cvery willing to spend hours outside of class helping students.\u201d He also did well in relating the material to real world examples.\r\n\r\nThis class is definitely not for students looking for an \u201ceasy A.\u201d This class was \u201csomewhat unstructured\u201d and didn\u2019t follow the syllabus much. In addition, students said that the prerequisite, STAT 430, was not sufficient to do well in this class.\r\n", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/23836/sections/001/reviews/5544-LAWRENCE-A--SHEPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5544-LAWRENCE-A--SHEPP", "first_name": "LAWRENCE A.", "last_name": "SHEPP", "id": "5544-LAWRENCE-A--SHEPP", "name": "LAWRENCE A.
