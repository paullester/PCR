{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4675"}, "description": "This 10-hour course prepares students to take the waiver exam for STAT 621. As such, it is a highly condensed review of the key topics which are described in more detail in STAT 621. The lectures focus upon multiple regression. Computer software is used extensively to compute and display statistical results. The waiver prep course is designed for students who have recently completed a statistics course covering topics through multiple regression. The lectures are intended to remind students of statistical methods once learned but forgotten. Most class time is spent interpreting results of statistical analyses; it is assumed that basic concepts and methods such as hypothesis testing are known but somewhat forgotten. The rapid format of the course makes it very difficult for students who have not studied this material previously to learn it sufficiently well to pass the waiver examination. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "STAT WAIVER PREPARATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18122/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.59", "rDifficulty": "2.95", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "2.77", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.28", "rInstructorAccess": "2.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "STAT WAIVER PREPARATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-608-001", "path": "/courses/18122/sections/001", "id": "18122-001", "aliases": ["STAT-608-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 214, "path": "/courses/18122/sections/001/reviews/1162-ROBERT-A-STINE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1162-ROBERT-A-STINE", "first_name": "ROBERT A", "last_name": "STINE", "id": "1162-ROBERT-A-STINE", "name": "ROBERT A STINE"}, "num_reviewers": 109, "id": "18122-001-1162-ROBERT-A-STINE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STAT-608", "path": "/courses/18122", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18122/sections", "values": [{"name": "STAT WAIVER PREPARATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-608-001", "path": "/courses/18122/sections/001", "id": "18122-001", "aliases": ["STAT-608-001"]}]}, "id": 18122, "aliases": ["STAT-608"]}
