Topics include multiple linear regression, the bootstrap, quantile regression, instrumental variables, maximum likelihood and probit regression.\r\n\r\nStudents found the flow of the class helpful, in that the class started with a review of linear models and then progressed to \u201cmore modern treatments.\u201d Students also remarked that \u201cthe applied nature of the assignments made the material more accessible and understandable,\u201d even though the material is \u201cdifficult\u201d in itself. Students thought the class was \u201cwell-organized.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents commented that Professor Small \u201cdid a good job covering the important concepts.\u201d Students remarked that Professor Small was \u201cextremely helpful,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d and very willing to meet outside of class with students who still had questions.\r\n\r\nOverall, students said STAT 520 was a \u201cvery helpful, useful course,\u201d especially for graduate students. The grades in this course were based on homework assignments and projects. There was no final exam. Math 114 is a prerequisite for this course. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, and is, according one student, \u201ca must-have course for non-majors interested in econometrics.\u201d\r\nOverall, students praised the class. Some described the course as \u201cexcellent\u201d and one commented that they \u201clearned a lot about econometrics theory in this course.\u201d However, one student did comment that they were \u201choping the course was going to be more applied than it actually was.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents had only good things to say about Professor Small. Students said he was \u201capproachable\u201d and \u201cwilling to help other students.\u201d One student commented that he \u201cis very willing to meet with students during office hours and makes time outside of office hours as well.\u201d \r\n\r\n*This review is based on 9 student comments\r\n", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/25167/sections/001/reviews/2366-DYLAN-S--SMALL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2366-DYLAN-S--SMALL", "first_name": "DYLAN S.", "last_name": "SMALL", "id": "2366-DYLAN-S--SMALL", "name": "DYLAN S.
