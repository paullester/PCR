{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4677"}, "description": "This six-week, elective MBA course continues the required MBA statistics course, Stat 621. It expands the material covered in Stat 621 in several ways, adding both breadth (e.g., logistic regression) and depth to the coverage of regression (e.g., more diagnostics, model selection). The course emphasizes the models for decision making from large data sets, as common in data-mining. Lectures feature extensive analysis of large data sets from marketing, personal finance, and management. The course presumes that students are familiar with the inferential methods covered in STAT 603/621 (including hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, p-values) as well as the use and interpretation of least squares regression models. The course also uses JMP as in STAT 621. Beginning with a review of these concepts, STAT 622 covers related methodologies that produce fits that resemble and extend regression models. The methodologies include those that expand the nature of the predictors (as in the use of special transformations in time series and the construction of regression trees) and allow the use of categorical reponses (logistic regression). The course concludes by exploring the relationship between a regression fit to observational data and an analysis of variance estimated from experimental data, as in a conjoint analysis. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "STATISTICAL MODELING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18124/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "3.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.51", "rCourseQuality": "3.34", "rWorkRequired": "2.87", "rInstructorAccess": "3.49", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.68", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.66"}, "section": {"name": "STATISTICAL MODELING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-622-001", "path": "/courses/18124/sections/001", "id": "18124-001", "aliases": ["STAT-622-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/18124/sections/001/reviews/1162-ROBERT-A-STINE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1162-ROBERT-A-STINE", "first_name": "ROBERT A", "last_name": "STINE", "id": "1162-ROBERT-A-STINE", "name": "ROBERT A STINE"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "18124-001-1162-ROBERT-A-STINE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STAT-622", "path": "/courses/18124", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18124/sections", "values": [{"name": "STATISTICAL MODELING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STAT-622-001", "path": "/courses/18124/sections/001", "id": "18124-001", "aliases": ["STAT-622-001"]}]}, "id": 18124, "aliases": ["STAT-622"]}
