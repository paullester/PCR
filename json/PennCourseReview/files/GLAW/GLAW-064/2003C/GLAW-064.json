{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/534"}, "description": "These courses are for students who do not necessarily intend to pursue a career in the law. They aim to communicate the nature of legal scholarship and thinking in the context of a specific area, such as intentional torts, affirmative action or civil rights. The courses will emphasize critical readings of case material, and will place this material in the appropriate social, cultural and legal contexts. \n\nThe topic for Fall 1997 is The American Legal System taught by Samuel Diamond. This course examines how American civil law responds to economic, social, technological and political change. It will trace selected areas of law, such as products liability, issues of life and death (e.g., heroic measures and termination of life-support by artificial means), and the changing role of lawyers in society. \n\nPrevious topics have included Race and Rights, and Blasphemy. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "SELECTED TOPICS IN LAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4195/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.92", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "SELECTED TOPICS IN LAW", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GLAW-064-301", "path": "/courses/4195/sections/301", "id": "4195-301", "aliases": ["GLAW-064-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/4195/sections/301/reviews/576-SAMUEL-DIAMOND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/576-SAMUEL-DIAMOND", "first_name": "SAMUEL", "last_name": "DIAMOND", "id": "576-SAMUEL-DIAMOND", "name": "SAMUEL DIAMOND"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "4195-301-576-SAMUEL-DIAMOND"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GLAW-064", "path": "/courses/4195", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4195/sections", "values": [{"name": "SELECTED TOPICS IN LAW", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GLAW-064-301", "path": "/courses/4195/sections/301", "id": "4195-301", "aliases": ["GLAW-064-301"]}]}, "id": 4195, "aliases": ["GLAW-064"]}
