Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense, and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16856/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/16856/sections/900", "id": "16856-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/16856/sections/900/reviews/3499-FRANK-NOVITZKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3499-FRANK-NOVITZKI", "first_name": "FRANK", "last_name": "NOVITZKI", "id": "3499-FRANK-NOVITZKI", "name": "FRANK NOVITZKI"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "16856-900-3499-FRANK-NOVITZKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-130", "path": "/courses/16856", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16856/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/16856/sections/900", "id": "16856-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}]}, "id": 16856, "aliases": ["SPAN-130"]}
