Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense, and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions. \n\n", "semester": "2005B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11342/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.55", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rInstructorConcern": "3.91", "rCourseQuality": "3.73", "rClassPace": "2.18", "rExamsConsistent": "3.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82", "rGradeFairness": "3.91", "rArticulateGoals": "3.64", "rOralSkills": "3.73", "rNativeAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rInstructorEffective": "3.91", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/11342/sections/900", "id": "11342-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/11342/sections/900/reviews/1725-RACHEL-BURK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1725-RACHEL-BURK", "first_name": "RACHEL", "last_name": "BURK", "id": "1725-RACHEL-BURK", "name": "RACHEL BURK"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "11342-900-1725-RACHEL-BURK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-130", "path": "/courses/11342", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11342/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/11342/sections/900", "id": "11342-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}]}, "id": 11342, "aliases": ["SPAN-130"]}
