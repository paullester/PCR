{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1070"}, "description": "Spanish 130 is a first-semester intermediate-level language course that emphasizes the development of the four basic skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking skills) within a culturally based context. Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense, and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9886/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.56", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.78", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rInstructorConcern": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rClassPace": "2.67", "rExamsConsistent": "3.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.89", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "3.89", "rOralSkills": "3.78", "rNativeAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rInstructorEffective": "3.78", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/9886/sections/900", "id": "9886-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/9886/sections/900/reviews/2340-MADERA-G--ALLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2340-MADERA-G--ALLAN", "first_name": "MADERA G.", "last_name": "ALLAN", "id": "2340-MADERA-G--ALLAN", "name": "MADERA G.
