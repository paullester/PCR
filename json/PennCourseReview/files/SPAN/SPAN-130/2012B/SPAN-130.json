Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense, and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions. \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28448/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.80", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.60", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.80", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rInstructorConcern": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rClassPace": "2.20", "rExamsConsistent": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rGradeFairness": "2.80", "rArticulateGoals": "3.40", "rOralSkills": "3.40", "rNativeAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rInstructorEffective": "4.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/28448/sections/900", "id": "28448-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/28448/sections/900/reviews/4118-SANDRA-M-CASANOVA-VIZCAINO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4118-SANDRA-M-CASANOVA-VIZCAINO", "first_name": "SANDRA M", "last_name": "CASANOVA-VIZCAINO", "id": "4118-SANDRA-M-CASANOVA-VIZCAINO", "name": "SANDRA M CASANOVA-VIZCAINO"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "28448-900-4118-SANDRA-M-CASANOVA-VIZCAINO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-130", "path": "/courses/28448", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28448/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/28448/sections/900", "id": "28448-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}]}, "id": 28448, "aliases": ["SPAN-130"]}
