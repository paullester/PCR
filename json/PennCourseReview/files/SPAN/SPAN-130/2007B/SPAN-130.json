{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1070"}, "description": "Spanish 130 is a first-semester intermediate-level language course that emphasizes the development of the four basic skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking skills) within a culturally based context. Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense, and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12787/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.92", "rTAQuality": "0.57", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.62", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.92", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "3.69", "rInstructorConcern": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "3.69", "rClassPace": "2.31", "rExamsConsistent": "3.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.85", "rGradeFairness": "3.62", "rArticulateGoals": "3.62", "rOralSkills": "3.69", "rNativeAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85", "rWorkRequired": "1.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rInstructorEffective": "3.77", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/12787/sections/900", "id": "12787-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/12787/sections/900/reviews/1725-RACHEL-BURK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1725-RACHEL-BURK", "first_name": "RACHEL", "last_name": "BURK", "id": "1725-RACHEL-BURK", "name": "RACHEL BURK"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "12787-900-1725-RACHEL-BURK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-130", "path": "/courses/12787", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12787/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/12787/sections/900", "id": "12787-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}]}, "id": 12787, "aliases": ["SPAN-130"]}
