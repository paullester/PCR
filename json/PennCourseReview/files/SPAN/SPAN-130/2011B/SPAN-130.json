Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense, and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions. \n\n", "semester": "2011B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25520/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "3.50", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.75", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rInstructorConcern": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rClassPace": "2.25", "rExamsConsistent": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "3.50", "rOralSkills": "3.75", "rNativeAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rInstructorEffective": "3.50", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/25520/sections/900", "id": "25520-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/25520/sections/900/reviews/5682-BRYAN-JONES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5682-BRYAN-JONES", "first_name": "BRYAN", "last_name": "JONES", "id": "5682-BRYAN-JONES", "name": "BRYAN JONES"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "25520-900-5682-BRYAN-JONES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-130", "path": "/courses/25520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25520/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SPAN-130-900", "path": "/courses/25520/sections/900", "id": "25520-900", "aliases": ["SPAN-130-900"]}]}, "id": 25520, "aliases": ["SPAN-130"]}
