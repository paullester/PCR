{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1520"}, "description": "Spanish 134 is an intensive intermediate-level language course that covers the material presented in Spanish 130 and Spanish 140. The course emphasizes the development of the four canonical skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking) within a culturally based context. Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts, relevant vocabulary, and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in a meaningful context. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary, the controlled use of the past tense and major uses of the subjunctive, and the development of writing skills. \n\nDuring the spring semester, Spanish 134 is limited to those students who have satisfied the language requirement in another language. During the summer, the course is open to all students who meet placement requirements. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ACCEL INTERMEDIATE SPAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28168/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.63", "rTAQuality": "3.25", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.13", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.50", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rInstructorConcern": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rClassPace": "2.25", "rExamsConsistent": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rGradeFairness": "3.38", "rArticulateGoals": "3.25", "rOralSkills": "3.38", "rNativeAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rInstructorEffective": "2.63", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ACCEL INTERMEDIATE SPAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SPAN-134-301", "path": "/courses/28168/sections/301", "id": "28168-301", "aliases": ["SPAN-134-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/28168/sections/301/reviews/5876-MARIA-PAREDES-FERNANDEZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5876-MARIA-PAREDES-FERNANDEZ", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "PAREDES FERNANDEZ", "id": "5876-MARIA-PAREDES-FERNANDEZ", "name": "MARIA PAREDES FERNANDEZ"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "28168-301-5876-MARIA-PAREDES-FERNANDEZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-134", "path": "/courses/28168", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28168/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACCEL INTERMEDIATE SPAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SPAN-134-301", "path": "/courses/28168/sections/301", "id": "28168-301", "aliases": ["SPAN-134-301"]}]}, "id": 28168, "aliases": ["SPAN-134"]}
