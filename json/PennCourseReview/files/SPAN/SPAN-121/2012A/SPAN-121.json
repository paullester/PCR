{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1068"}, "description": "Spanish 121 is designed for students who have some prior experience in Spanish. This course provides a quick-paced review of material normally covered in a first-semester Spanish course and then proceeds to introduce new material so students will be prepared to take Spanish 130 during the subsequent semester. \n\nAs other Spanish courses, Spanish 121 emphasizes the development of foundational reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills while exploring the rich cultural mosaic of the Spanish-speaking world. Students will participate in pair, small-group and whole-class activities that focus on meaningful and accurate communication skills in the target language. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ELEMENTARY SPANISH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28165/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.83", "rTAQuality": "3.80", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.42", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.42", "rInstructorConcern": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rClassPace": "2.25", "rExamsConsistent": "3.58", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rGradeFairness": "3.50", "rArticulateGoals": "3.67", "rOralSkills": "3.92", "rNativeAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.92", "rInstructorEffective": "3.73", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.92"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY SPANISH", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "SPAN-121-302", "path": "/courses/28165/sections/302", "id": "28165-302", "aliases": ["SPAN-121-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/28165/sections/302/reviews/4123-SAMIA-ABDUL-BAGI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4123-SAMIA-ABDUL-BAGI", "first_name": "SAMIA", "last_name": "ABDUL BAGI", "id": "4123-SAMIA-ABDUL-BAGI", "name": "SAMIA ABDUL BAGI"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "28165-302-4123-SAMIA-ABDUL-BAGI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SPAN-121", "path": "/courses/28165", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28165/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY SPANISH", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "SPAN-121-302", "path": "/courses/28165/sections/302", "id": "28165-302", "aliases": ["SPAN-121-302"]}]}, "id": 28165, "aliases": ["SPAN-121"]}
