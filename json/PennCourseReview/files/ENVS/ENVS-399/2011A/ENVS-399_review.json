Topic selection, advisor identification, funding options, and basic research methods will be discussed.\r\n\r\nStudents wished that the course were \"geared more towards the policy majors\" rather than bringing in guest speakers that focused mostly on geology. The class also focused on \"how to formulate an idea in any field\" and the tools necessary for an effective research paper, rather than learning about \u201cpolicy or science or architecture.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students remarked that Professor Pepino could have been more helpful by setting up meetings for the majors to discuss \"specific goals related to the senior thesis.\"\r\n\r\nOne student remarked that the \"grading on all assignments was completely arbitrary.\" Background in statistics may be helpful for one of the assignments. \r\n\r\n*This review was based on less than 8 comments\r\n", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/21640/sections/401/reviews/3292-RICHARD-PEPINO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3292-RICHARD-PEPINO", "first_name": "RICHARD", "last_name": "PEPINO", "id": "3292-RICHARD-PEPINO", "name": "RICHARD PEPINO"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "21640-401-3292-RICHARD-PEPINO"}]
