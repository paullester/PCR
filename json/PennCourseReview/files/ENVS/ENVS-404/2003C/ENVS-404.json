{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1830"}, "description": "Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities, impaired hearing, behavioral problems, and at very high levels, seizures, coma and even death. Children up to the age of six are especially at risk because of their developing systems; they often ingest lead chips and dust while playing in their home and yards. \n\nIn ENVS 404, Penn undergraduates learn about the epidemiology of lead poisoning, the pathways of exposure, and methods for community outreach and education. Penn students collaborate with middle school and high school teachers in West Philadelphia to engage middle school children in exercises that apply environmental research relating to lead poisoning to their homes and neighborhoods. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "URBAN ENVIRON: WEST PHIL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4091/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "1.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN ENVIRON: WEST PHIL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENVS-404-401", "path": "/courses/4091/sections/401", "id": "4091-401", "aliases": ["ENVS-404-401", "HSOC-404-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/4091/sections/401/reviews/463-ELAINE-WRIGHT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/463-ELAINE-WRIGHT", "first_name": "ELAINE", "last_name": "WRIGHT", "id": "463-ELAINE-WRIGHT", "name": "ELAINE WRIGHT"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "4091-401-463-ELAINE-WRIGHT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENVS-404", "path": "/courses/4091", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4091/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN ENVIRON: WEST PHIL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENVS-404-401", "path": "/courses/4091/sections/401", "id": "4091-401", "aliases": ["ENVS-404-401", "HSOC-404-401"]}]}, "id": 4091, "aliases": ["ENVS-404", "HSOC-404"]}
