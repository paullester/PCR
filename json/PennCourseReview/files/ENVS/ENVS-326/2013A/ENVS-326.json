{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5657"}, "description": "This course is a hands-on introduction to the concepts and capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS). Students will develop the skills necessary for carrying out basic GIS projects and for advanced GIS coursework. The class will focus on a broad range of functional and practical applications,ranging from environmental science and planning to land use history, social demography, and public health. By the end of the course, students will be ableto find, organize, map, and analyze data using both vector (i.e. drawing-based) and raster (i.e. image-based) GIS tools, while developing an appreciation for basic cartographic principles relating to map presentation.This course fulfillsthe spatial analysis requirement for ENVS and EASC Majors. Previous experiencein the use of GIS is not required. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MAPPING PLAC & ANALY SPA: GIS MAPPING PLACES & ANALYZING SPACES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30244/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "MAPPING PLAC & ANALY SPA: GIS MAPPING PLACES & ANALYZING SPACES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENVS-326-001", "path": "/courses/30244/sections/001", "id": "30244-001", "aliases": ["ENVS-326-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/30244/sections/001/reviews/5688-KRISTA-HEINLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5688-KRISTA-HEINLEN", "first_name": "KRISTA", "last_name": "HEINLEN", "id": "5688-KRISTA-HEINLEN", "name": "KRISTA HEINLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "30244-001-5688-KRISTA-HEINLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENVS-326", "path": "/courses/30244", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30244/sections", "values": [{"name": "MAPPING PLAC & ANALY SPA: GIS MAPPING PLACES & ANALYZING SPACES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENVS-326-001", "path": "/courses/30244/sections/001", "id": "30244-001", "aliases": ["ENVS-326-001"]}]}, "id": 30244, "aliases": ["ENVS-326"]}
