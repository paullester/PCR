{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4855"}, "description": "This course will survey episodes in the history of the United States, especially in the twentieth century, that illustrate technology's central role of shaping environments, that illustrate the uses of the law in mediating social conflict concerning technologies and the environment. An important intent of the course will be to lead students to consider various environments along the spectrum of human manipulation, ranging from wilderness to agricultural landscapes and from designed gardens to urban and industrial environments. The main focus of the course will be on uses of the law by competing groups to mediate environmental conflicts through negotiation of treaties; lobbying legislative bodies to pass laws; influencing regulators to stiffen or weaken regulations; drawing police authorieties into the fray; and seeking favorable rulings from the courts. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "LAW, ENVIRONMENT & TECHN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20907/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "LAW, ENVIRONMENT & TECHN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STSC-271-001", "path": "/courses/20907/sections/001", "id": "20907-001", "aliases": ["STSC-271-001", "ENVS-271-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/20907/sections/001/reviews/3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK", "first_name": "FREDRIC L", "last_name": "QUIVIK", "id": "3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK", "name": "FREDRIC L QUIVIK"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "20907-001-3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-271", "path": "/courses/20907", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20907/sections", "values": [{"name": "LAW, ENVIRONMENT & TECHN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STSC-271-001", "path": "/courses/20907/sections/001", "id": "20907-001", "aliases": ["STSC-271-001", "ENVS-271-001"]}]}, "id": 20907, "aliases": ["STSC-271", "ENVS-271"]}
