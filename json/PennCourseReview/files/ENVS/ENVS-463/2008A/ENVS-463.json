{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4037"}, "description": "This course gives an overview of the genesis of the so-called \"Brownfield\" problem and of the various efforts that our society is taking to try to solve, or at least ameliorate it. The course will place the \"Brownfield\" problem in the broader context of the growth and decline of industrial base cities like Philadelphia. Students will study the general constitutional and statutory framework within which we approach the problems of orphan, polluted sites and the disposal of contemporary solid wastes. They will also analyze the principal actions that have been taken by federal and state governments to address remediation and redevelopment of abandoned industrial sites. In addition, the course will explore environmental equity issues. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "BROWNFIELD REMEDIATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20123/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.19", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "BROWNFIELD REMEDIATION", "sectionnum": "660", "primary_alias": "ENVS-463-660", "path": "/courses/20123/sections/660", "id": "20123-660", "aliases": ["ENVS-463-660", "URBS-463-660", "ENVS-643-660"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/20123/sections/660/reviews/1763-JOHN-C--KEENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1763-JOHN-C--KEENE", "first_name": "JOHN C.", "last_name": "KEENE", "id": "1763-JOHN-C--KEENE", "name": "JOHN C.
