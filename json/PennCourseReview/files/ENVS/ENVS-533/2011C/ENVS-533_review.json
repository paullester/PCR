In this course, how to identify an appropriate research\r\nproject, how to design a research plan, and how to prepare a detailed proposal are\r\ndiscussed. Each student should enter the course with a preliminary research plan and\r\nshould have identified an advisor. By the end of the course, each student is expected to\r\nhave a completed Capstone proposal that has been reviewed and approved by his/her\r\nadvisor.\r\nStudents in this course generally agreed that they did not learn much, saying the\r\ncourse was \u201cnot very useful.\u201d Several found the course to be \u201ca bit repetitive\u201d and\r\n\u201cbetter suited for people unfamiliar with the research process.\u201d However, most students\r\nagreed that it was helpful for \u201cstaying on track to complete a capstone proposal.\u201d Many\r\nstudents commented that there was little student interaction, which they thought would\r\nhave made the course more helpful.\r\nNot many students reported directly on the professor for this course. Those who\r\ndid called Professor Kulik an \u201cexcellent instructor,\u201d \u201cvery approachable,\u201d and \u201ca nice\r\nman.\u201d However, a couple of students noted that Professor Kulik repeatedly ended class\r\nvery early. One student remarked that Professor Kulik, \u201ccancelled classes,\u2026 consistently\r\nstarted late, dismissed class early and did not provide any insight into project ideas with\r\nhis conversation or homework submissions.\u201d\r\nGenerally, students did not remark on the difficulty of the course. One student\r\nremarked that the \u201creadings weren\u2019t necessary\u201d and that the professor \u201cnever referred to\u201d\r\nthe purchased book in class.", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/24353/sections/660/reviews/4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "KULIK", "id": "4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "name": "MICHAEL KULIK"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "24353-660-4317-MICHAEL-KULIK"}]
