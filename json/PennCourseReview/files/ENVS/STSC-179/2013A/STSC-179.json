{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3812"}, "description": "The field of environmental history studies human history in the context of the biological and physical setting we call \"nature\" or \"the environment.\" It focuses on the interactions between natural actors (landscapes, weather, plants, animals, microorganisms) and human actors. Just as human actors have shaped the biological and physical world, so actors from the biological and physical world have shaped human history. This course explores the history of American environmental change as a set of questions about how and why the natural world have changed over time. Topics include: European encounters with the Americas, industralization, conservation of natural resources, preservation of wilderness and wildlife, urban pollution and health, the rise of environmentalism, and the impact of warfare. In each case we will ask how natural actors and Americans' ideas about nature interacted with political institutions, economic arrangements, social groups and cultural values, in order to explain the course of environmental change. We will explore the multiple, shifting meanings of \"nature,\" trace changes in environmental use and impact, and evaluate past events in light of current ideas about sustainability. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31064/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.40", "rTAQuality": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.35", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.76", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-179-401", "path": "/courses/31064/sections/401", "id": "31064-401", "aliases": ["STSC-179-401", "HSOC-179-401", "ENVS-179-401", "HIST-320-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/31064/sections/401/reviews/606-ANN-NORTON-GREENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/606-ANN-NORTON-GREENE", "first_name": "ANN NORTON", "last_name": "GREENE", "id": "606-ANN-NORTON-GREENE", "name": "ANN NORTON GREENE"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "31064-401-606-ANN-NORTON-GREENE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-179", "path": "/courses/31064", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31064/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-179-401", "path": "/courses/31064/sections/401", "id": "31064-401", "aliases": ["STSC-179-401", "HSOC-179-401", "ENVS-179-401", "HIST-320-401"]}]}, "id": 31064, "aliases": ["STSC-179", "HSOC-179", "ENVS-179", "HIST-320"]}
