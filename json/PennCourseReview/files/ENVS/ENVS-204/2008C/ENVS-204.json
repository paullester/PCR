{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4563"}, "description": "Public perceptions and attitudes concerning the causes and importance of globalwarming have changed. Global Climate Change provides a sound theoretical understanding of global warming through an appreciation of the Earth's climate system and how and why this has changed through time. We will describe progress in understanding of the human and natural drivers of climate change, climate processes and attribution, and estimates of projected future climate change. We will assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant for the understanding of climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18618/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.58", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "3.26", "rRecommendMajor": "3.84", "rCourseQuality": "3.68", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.26", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENVS-204-001", "path": "/courses/18618/sections/001", "id": "18618-001", "aliases": ["ENVS-204-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/18618/sections/001/reviews/2987-BENJAMIN-P--HORTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2987-BENJAMIN-P--HORTON", "first_name": "BENJAMIN P.", "last_name": "HORTON", "id": "2987-BENJAMIN-P--HORTON", "name": "BENJAMIN P.
