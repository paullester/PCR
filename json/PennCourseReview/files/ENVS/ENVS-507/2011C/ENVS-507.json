{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1831"}, "description": "The course focuses on the natural history of different wetland types including climate, geology, and,hydrology factors that influence wetland development Associated soil, vegetation, and wildlife characteristics and key ecological processes will be covered as well. Lectures will be supplemented with weekend wetland types, ranging from tidal salt marshes to non-tidal marshes, swamps, and glacial bogs in order to provide field experience in wetland identification, characterization, and functional assessment. Outside speakers will discuss issues in wetland seed bank ecology, federal regulation, and mitigation. Students will present a short paper on the ecology of a wetland animal and a longer term paper on a selected wetland topic. Readings from the text, assorted journal papers, government technical documents, and book excerpts will provide a broad overview of the multifaceted field of wetland study. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "WETLANDS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24352/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "2.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "2.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.77", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "WETLANDS", "sectionnum": "660", "primary_alias": "ENVS-507-660", "path": "/courses/24352/sections/660", "id": "24352-660", "aliases": ["ENVS-507-660"]}, "comments": "The course focuses on the natural history of different wetland types including\r\nclimate, geology, and, hydrology factors that influence wetland development.
