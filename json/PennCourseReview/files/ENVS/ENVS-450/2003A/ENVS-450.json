{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1294"}, "description": "This course covers the development and analysis of environmental budgets and input-output models that are commonly used in earth and environmental science. The first part of the semester will concentrate on the physical laws, systems principles, and analytical tools used in developing and evaluating input-output models and environmental budgets. In the remainder of the semester, we will develop and analyze hydrologic, energy and nutrient budgets for a variety of systems. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "TECH IN ENV ACCOUNTING: Techniques in environmental accounting and system analysis", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1604/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "TECH IN ENV ACCOUNTING: Techniques in environmental accounting and system analysis", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENVS-450-001", "path": "/courses/1604/sections/001", "id": "1604-001", "aliases": ["ENVS-450-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/1604/sections/001/reviews/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "first_name": "FREDERICK N.", "last_name": "SCATENA", "id": "1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "name": "FREDERICK N.
