{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5656"}, "description": "The study of sustainability-the long term viability of humans in harmony with the environment-has been identified as a critical issue for society and industry and is evolving to examine how society should conduct itself in order to survive.This issue impacts the consumer goods that we use in our lives,the processes that are designed to make these goods, and the raw materials that we obtain to create these goods.The questions that we will examine will be:can these goods be obtained,made,and consumed in a fashion that allows the current quality of life to be mantained (or enhanced) for future generations? Can these processes be sustainable? A review of consumer goods is necessary as the starting point in order to understand the basic needs of people in society and why people consume goods as they do. Subsequently,each student will choose a product to examine in detail and will research the product for its impact with respect to natural resource selection,production,use,and disposal/reuse. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "SUSTAINABLE GOODS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30243/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.88", "rStimulateInterest": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "SUSTAINABLE GOODS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENVS-325-001", "path": "/courses/30243/sections/001", "id": "30243-001", "aliases": ["ENVS-325-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/30243/sections/001/reviews/6490-JAMES-R--HAGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6490-JAMES-R--HAGAN", "first_name": "JAMES R.", "last_name": "HAGAN", "id": "6490-JAMES-R--HAGAN", "name": "JAMES R.
