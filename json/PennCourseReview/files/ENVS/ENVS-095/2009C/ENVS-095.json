{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4562"}, "description": "Throughout nature it is evident that life is not risk free. Humans are particularly adept at modifying and shaping our environment, but with each advance in science, technology, and medicine comes an element of risk. Toxicants in our environment such as heavy metals, plastics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and air pollutants pose an exposure risk and are hot topics of concern, but the magnitude of their threat is often difficult to understand and communicate. How should these risks be translated from the academic laboratory to the public? What filters shape the way that we perceive risks? This seminar will promote an analysis of the risks we face on a daily basis, and the determinants which shape our willingness to accept some risks while rejecting others. Students will be asked to identify real environmental hazards, and to study how those exposures affect the public. A goal of this seminar is to nurture skills in critical appraisal, and spoken and written communication, which will be important in lifelong advocacy pursuits. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "Risk Communication and the Environment", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17292/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "1.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "Risk Communication and the Environment", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENVS-095-301", "path": "/courses/17292/sections/301", "id": "17292-301", "aliases": ["ENVS-095-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/17292/sections/301/reviews/4794-KEVIN-OSTERHOUDT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4794-KEVIN-OSTERHOUDT", "first_name": "KEVIN", "last_name": "OSTERHOUDT", "id": "4794-KEVIN-OSTERHOUDT", "name": "KEVIN OSTERHOUDT"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "17292-301-4794-KEVIN-OSTERHOUDT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENVS-095", "path": "/courses/17292", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17292/sections", "values": [{"name": "Risk Communication and the Environment", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENVS-095-301", "path": "/courses/17292/sections/301", "id": "17292-301", "aliases": ["ENVS-095-301"]}]}, "id": 17292, "aliases": ["ENVS-095"]}
