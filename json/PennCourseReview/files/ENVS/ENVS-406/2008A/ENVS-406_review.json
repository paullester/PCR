The curriculum ranged from diverse topics such as household mold and second-hand smoke to cancer clusters and obesity.  The class was also an Academically-Based Community Service course that required community service in addition to class time.\r\n\r\nThe class involved a combination of lectures, guest speakers, readings, student presentations, discussions, research, and community service.  The students had two small research assignments with class presentations, including an Environmental and Health Policy Analysis and an Industrial Pollution Case Study Analysis, according to the course description. The major research assignment for the course was an environmental health topic of the student\u2019s choosing, with recommendations for solving the problem based on the student\u2019s research.\r\n\r\nStudents found the class to be fairly easy and extremely rewarding, providing \u201cuseful knowledge about the problems in the community and how to alleviate them.\u201d  They especially enjoyed the \u201cinteresting\u201d guest lecturers.  Students worked in groups and individually to research the environmental health topics.\r\n\r\nStudents thought Professor Pepino was \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201cenergetic,\u201d and \u201cinspiring.\u201d  Several commented on his ability to stimulate interest in the subject matter.  As one student raved, \u201cHe really cares both about the subject matter and about his students.  One of the best teachers at Penn; take any course he offers even if you\u2019re not interested.\u201d  The only complaint was that Pepino was sometimes hard to get in touch with, or feedback was delayed.  Overall, however, he was rated highly for accessibility.
