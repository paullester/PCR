{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/437"}, "description": "Over the last century we have witnessed the dominance of man over nature. Technology, our understanding of our environment and our consumption habits have been the principal weapons used in this conquest. Now, at the beginning of a new millenium, questions and concerns about our actions and perceptions are being raised. Can today's technology and new knowledge about our environment and human nature assure our survival? How can we use the next hundred years to reconstruct and restore our future? These are the fundamental questions that the class will investigate.This course will rely on evidence,the use of hypotheses, theories, and logic as well as students' scientific inquiry and creativity. We will discuss systems, models, simulations, constancy, patterns of change, evolution, and scale. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "THE NEXT MILLENIUM: Next Millenium: Would Technology Help Us Resolve The Environmental Dilemma?", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21636/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.40", "rDifficulty": "1.10", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.64", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.18", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.91", "rCommAbility": "2.36", "rInstructorQuality": "2.09"}, "section": {"name": "THE NEXT MILLENIUM: Next Millenium: Would Technology Help Us Resolve The Environmental Dilemma?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENVS-098-301", "path": "/courses/21636/sections/301", "id": "21636-301", "aliases": ["ENVS-098-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/21636/sections/301/reviews/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "first_name": "JORGE JUAN", "last_name": "SANTIAGO", "id": "349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "name": "JORGE JUAN SANTIAGO"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "21636-301-349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.40", "rDifficulty": "1.10", "rStimulateInterest": "1.55", "rRecommendMajor": "1.64", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.55", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.91", "rCommAbility": "1.36", "rInstructorQuality": "1.92"}, "section": {"name": "THE NEXT MILLENIUM: Next Millenium: Would Technology Help Us Resolve The Environmental Dilemma?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENVS-098-301", "path": "/courses/21636/sections/301", "id": "21636-301", "aliases": ["ENVS-098-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/21636/sections/301/reviews/459-M-HAMED-K-BOKRETA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/459-M-HAMED-K-BOKRETA", "first_name": "M'HAMED K", "last_name": "BOKRETA", "id": "459-M-HAMED-K-BOKRETA", "name": "M'HAMED K BOKRETA"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "21636-301-459-M-HAMED-K-BOKRETA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENVS-098", "path": "/courses/21636", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21636/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE NEXT MILLENIUM: Next Millenium: Would Technology Help Us Resolve The Environmental Dilemma?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENVS-098-301", "path": "/courses/21636/sections/301", "id": "21636-301", "aliases": ["ENVS-098-301"]}]}, "id": 21636, "aliases": ["ENVS-098"]}
