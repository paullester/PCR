{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4380"}, "description": "In this class, we will examine many of the ethical issues involved in being a member of a political system. As such, we will look philosophically at the obligations and responsibilities that individuals have as citizens, as legislators, and as judges. Some of the questions that we will discuss include; Do citizens have an obligation to obey the law? When is civil disobedience justified? How ought a citizen vote? What, if any, are the ethical requirements of democratic citizenry besides voting? If they conflict, should a legislator vote their own judgment or the judgment of those they represent? How should a legislator balance achievement of goals with ethical restrictions on methods? Are citizens morally responsible for the decisions of those they elect? How ought judges interpret the laws? How much discretion ought judges have in a democratic society? While we will be focused on addressing these specific questions, we will also survey many of the main theories of moral philosophy and political philosophy whenever they are relevant. Readings will include both historical and contemporary writing, and we will examine a number of case studies related to the issues. Those who take the class are expected to participate in class discussions, and will be asked to write both quick responses and a longer final project. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "TOPICS IN ETHICS: WAR & MORALITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22268/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "1.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "2.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN ETHICS: WAR & MORALITY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-073-401", "path": "/courses/22268/sections/401", "id": "22268-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-073-401", "ENVS-073-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/22268/sections/401/reviews/5254-KATHLEEN-R-HARBIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5254-KATHLEEN-R-HARBIN", "first_name": "KATHLEEN R", "last_name": "HARBIN", "id": "5254-KATHLEEN-R-HARBIN", "name": "KATHLEEN R HARBIN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "22268-401-5254-KATHLEEN-R-HARBIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-073", "path": "/courses/22268", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22268/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN ETHICS: WAR & MORALITY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-073-401", "path": "/courses/22268/sections/401", "id": "22268-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-073-401", "ENVS-073-401"]}]}, "id": 22268, "aliases": ["PHIL-073", "ENVS-073"]}
