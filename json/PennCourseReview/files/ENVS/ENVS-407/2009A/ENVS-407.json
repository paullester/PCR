{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/440"}, "description": "Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control reports that more than 80% of current adult tobacco users started smoking before age 18. The National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 12.8% of middle school students and 34.8% of high school students in their study used some form of tobacco products. \n\nIn ENVS 407, Penn undergraduates learn about the short and long term physiological consequences of smoking, social influences and peer norms regarding tobacco use, the effectiveness of cessation programs, tobacco advocacy and the impact of the tobacco settlement. Penn students will collaborate with teachers in West Philadelphia to prepare and deliver lessons to middle school students. The undergraduates will survey and evaluate middle school and Penn student smoking. One of the course goals is to raise awareness of the middle school children to prevent addiction to tobacco smoke during adolescence. Collaboration with the middle schools gives Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the prevention of tobacco smoking to real world situations. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PREVENTION OF TOBACCO: Prevention of Tobacco Addiction in Pre-Adolescent Children of Philadelphia", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15690/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.05", "rStimulateInterest": "3.18", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.37", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "2.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.74", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "PREVENTION OF TOBACCO: Prevention of Tobacco Addiction in Pre-Adolescent Children of Philadelphia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENVS-407-401", "path": "/courses/15690/sections/401", "id": "15690-401", "aliases": ["ENVS-407-401", "HSOC-407-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/15690/sections/401/reviews/4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "KULIK", "id": "4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "name": "MICHAEL KULIK"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "15690-401-4317-MICHAEL-KULIK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENVS-407", "path": "/courses/15690", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15690/sections", "values": [{"name": "PREVENTION OF TOBACCO: Prevention of Tobacco Addiction in Pre-Adolescent Children of Philadelphia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENVS-407-401", "path": "/courses/15690/sections/401", "id": "15690-401", "aliases": ["ENVS-407-401", "HSOC-407-401"]}]}, "id": 15690, "aliases": ["ENVS-407", "HSOC-407"]}
