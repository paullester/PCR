In addition to class, students will work with teachers in West Philadelphia to provide lessons for middle school students. Moreover, students will survey middle school and Penn student smoking. The goal of the course is to raise awareness among middle school children to prevent tobacco addiction during adolescence.\r\n\r\nMost students truly enjoyed the course and especially liked teaching middle school students. Students described the class as \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cfun,\u201d and \u201cfulfilling.\u201d One student called it \u201cthe best course [he\u2019s] ever taken during [his] four years at Penn.\u201d The majority felt they learned a great deal from guest lecturers and firsthand teaching.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kulik received stellar reviews. Students described Professor Kulik as \u201cknowledgeable, approachable, and funny.\u201d Some pointed out that his \u201cget-out-of-it-what-you-want-to-get-out-of-it\u201d method worked well with the structure of the course.\r\n\r\nBecause it is classified as ABCS, the course requires community service in addition to class time. The majority of workload is attributed to the hours put into teaching middle school students, writing a final paper, and preparing a tobacco ad counting project. The course was recommended for majors and non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/21642/sections/401/reviews/4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "KULIK", "id": "4317-MICHAEL-KULIK", "name": "MICHAEL KULIK"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "21642-401-4317-MICHAEL-KULIK"}]
