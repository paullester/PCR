{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4428"}, "description": "Energy is at the center of many discussions of today's world. How central is an apparently unlimited supply of energy to a helthy economy? What is the importance of sources of energy supply to national security? How can we expend the energy we need to foster human life as we know it without allowing climate change to disrupt the existing global environments that sustain the lives of humans and other living species in accustomed ways? How crucial is the current level of energy use to patterns of American consumption, and how willing are Americans to alter their consumption habits in order to reduce energy use? What is the connection between various sources of energy and the relationships of social, economic, and political power tht exist in the U.S. today. This course will examine changes in energy sources, energy use, and energy technolgoeis across American history in order to help students understand how the U.S. and the world arrived at its present situation with regard to energy and to understnad the complex technological, environmental, social, eocnomic, and political challenges implicit in any effort to modify the current trajectories of energy use. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ENERGY IN AMER HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16520/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.62", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.48", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "ENERGY IN AMER HIST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-272-401", "path": "/courses/16520/sections/401", "id": "16520-401", "aliases": ["STSC-272-401", "ENVS-272-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/16520/sections/401/reviews/3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK", "first_name": "FREDRIC L", "last_name": "QUIVIK", "id": "3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK", "name": "FREDRIC L QUIVIK"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "16520-401-3013-FREDRIC-L-QUIVIK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-272", "path": "/courses/16520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16520/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENERGY IN AMER HIST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-272-401", "path": "/courses/16520/sections/401", "id": "16520-401", "aliases": ["STSC-272-401", "ENVS-272-401"]}]}, "id": 16520, "aliases": ["STSC-272", "ENVS-272"]}
