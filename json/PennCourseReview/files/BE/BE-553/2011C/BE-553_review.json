This course explores\r\nprinciples of tissue engineering, drawing upon diverse fields such as developmental\r\nbiology, immunology, cell biology, physiology, transport phenomena, material science,\r\nand polymer chemistry. Current and developing methods of tissue engineering as well as\r\nspecific applications are discussed in the context of these principles.\r\nOverall, students \u201cenjoyed the course\u201d and felt that \u201cit covered a lot of content.\u201d\r\nStudents had to \u201cread a lot of papers\u201d for the class, and one of the exams was focused on\r\n\u201c10 research that were presented in class.\u201d The final project in the class was to develop a\r\nbusiness plan.\r\nThe class was said to be \u201cwell structured.\u201d However, there was no textbook or\r\n\u201cnotes posted online.\u201d\r\nSome students found the final exam difficult because it tested \u201cminute details,\u201d\r\nbut the class was fair; students were tested on \u201cmaterial that we learned in class.\u201d", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/24042/sections/001/reviews/5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS", "first_name": "CHELSEA N", "last_name": "SALINAS", "id": "5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS", "name": "CHELSEA N SALINAS"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "24042-001-5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS"}]
