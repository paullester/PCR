{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/196"}, "description": "Tissue engineering demonstrates enormous potential for improving human health. While there is an extensive body of literature discussing the state of the art of tissue engineering, the majority of this literature is descriptive and does little to address the principles that govern the success or failure of an engineering tissue. This course explores principles of tissue engineering, drawing upon diverse fields such as developmental biology, immunology, cell biology, physiology, transport phenomena, material science, and polymer chemistry. Current and developing methods of tissue engineering as well as specific applications will be discussed in the context of these principles. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "TISSUE ENG/PR/MTHD/APP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10103/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.26", "rDifficulty": "2.59", "rStimulateInterest": "3.15", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.41", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.37", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "TISSUE ENG/PR/MTHD/APP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-553-001", "path": "/courses/10103/sections/001", "id": "10103-001", "aliases": ["BE-553-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/10103/sections/001/reviews/157-KEITH-J--GOOCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/157-KEITH-J--GOOCH", "first_name": "KEITH J.", "last_name": "GOOCH", "id": "157-KEITH-J--GOOCH", "name": "KEITH J.
