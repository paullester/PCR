While there is an extensive body of literature discussing the state of the art of tissue engineering, the majority of this literature is descriptive and does little to address the principles that govern the success or failure of an engineering tissue.

There is no required textbook, but literature reviews and journal article analysis are incorporated throughout the course.\r\n\r\nStudents generally found the content covered in this course to be \u201cinteresting,\u201d but \u201cthe lack of a main text or reference negatively affected the ability to synthesize this information.\u201d Since \u201cthe field is inherently very new and disorganized\u201d and broad, some felt that the material was shallowly covered and that there was little cohesiveness between different topics. Some students wished that the course focused less on biology and more on quantitative problem solving; many equations were presented in the second half of the course but there weren\u2019t many examples to show what they were used for.\r\n\r\nProfessor Salinas was described by many students as \u201capproachable,\u201d \u201cfriendly,\u201d and \u201cvery helpful in and out of class.\u201d She created a \u201crelaxed, easygoing environment\u201d and encouraged student participation. However, some students agreed that she was \u201cflustered at times\u201d and \u201cnot able to explain a lot of concepts.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents generally felt that the workload required for this course was \u201creasonable,\u201d although extra reading was necessary due to the simplified nature of the material covered in class. Several students complained that they felt unprepared for the exams because Professor Salinas did not provide any information about their format. This is a graduate level course; undergraduates need instructor permission to enroll.\r\n", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/22695/sections/001/reviews/5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS", "first_name": "CHELSEA N", "last_name": "SALINAS", "id": "5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS", "name": "CHELSEA N SALINAS"}, "num_reviewers": 50, "id": "22695-001-5290-CHELSEA-N-SALINAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-553", "path": "/courses/22695", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22695/sections", "values": [{"name": "TISSUE ENG/PR/MTHD/APP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-553-001", "path": "/courses/22695/sections/001", "id": "22695-001", "aliases": ["BE-553-001"]}]}, "id": 22695, "aliases": ["BE-553"]}
