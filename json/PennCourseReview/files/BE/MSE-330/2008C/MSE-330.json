{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2628"}, "description": "Soft matter describes materials that are neither pure crystalline solids with long range atomic order or pure liquids characterized by one simple viscosity. Many times soft materials display both solid and liquid like behavior depending on the timescale of the applied stress. Colloids, polymers, amphiphiles, liquid crystals, and biomacromolecules are types of soft matter. The focus of this course is on the characteristics common to soft materials namely their length scale, fragile binding energies or proximity to phase transitions, dynamics and propensity to self-assemble. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "SOFT MATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19010/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "2.84", "rRecommendMajor": "3.39", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.28", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.84", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.39"}, "section": {"name": "SOFT MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-330-401", "path": "/courses/19010/sections/401", "id": "19010-401", "aliases": ["MSE-330-401", "BE-330-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/19010/sections/401/reviews/836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "first_name": "RUSSELL JOHN", "last_name": "COMPOSTO", "id": "836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "name": "RUSSELL JOHN COMPOSTO"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "19010-401-836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-330", "path": "/courses/19010", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19010/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOFT MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-330-401", "path": "/courses/19010/sections/401", "id": "19010-401", "aliases": ["MSE-330-401", "BE-330-401"]}]}, "id": 19010, "aliases": ["MSE-330", "BE-330"]}
