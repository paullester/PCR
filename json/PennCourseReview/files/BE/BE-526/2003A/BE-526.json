{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/195"}, "description": "We model the structure and function of neural systems in silicon using very large scale integration (VLSI) complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. To build these neuromorphic systems, we proceed from the device level, through the circuit level, to the system level. At the device level, we mimic electrodiffusion of ions through membrane channels with electrodiffusion of electrons through transistor channels. At the circuit level, we derive minimal implementation of synaptic interaction, dendritic integration, and active membrane behavior. At the system level, we synthesize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the cochlea, the retina, and early stages of cortical processing. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "BLDG BRAINS IN SILICON: BLDG BRAINS IN SILICON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1360/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "3.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.30", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.60", "rCommAbility": "2.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "BLDG BRAINS IN SILICON: BLDG BRAINS IN SILICON", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-526-401", "path": "/courses/1360/sections/401", "id": "1360-401", "aliases": ["BE-526-401", "INSC-574-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/1360/sections/401/reviews/158-KWABENA-A--BOAHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/158-KWABENA-A--BOAHEN", "first_name": "KWABENA A.", "last_name": "BOAHEN", "id": "158-KWABENA-A--BOAHEN", "name": "KWABENA A.
