{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/727"}, "description": "In the last 25 years there has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis, the Fourier transform, interpolation and approximation of functions, sampling theory, digital filtering and noise analysis. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "MATH OF MED IMAG&MEASURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18950/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.93", "rRecommendMajor": "2.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "MATH OF MED IMAG&MEASURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MATH-584-401", "path": "/courses/18950/sections/401", "id": "18950-401", "aliases": ["MATH-584-401", "BE-584-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/18950/sections/401/reviews/4410-PHILIP-T--GRESSMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4410-PHILIP-T--GRESSMAN", "first_name": "PHILIP T.", "last_name": "GRESSMAN", "id": "4410-PHILIP-T--GRESSMAN", "name": "PHILIP T.
