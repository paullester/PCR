The approach used first builds up the basic equations and then applies them to specific examples of biological interest such as diffusion of gases in the lung airways, pulsatile blood flow in arteries and veins, and mass transfer of solutes in the renal tubules in the kidney. The development of problem solving skills using both analytical and computational approaches will be emphasized.\r\n\r\nStudents generally liked the pacing of the course, which was relaxed despite the difficulty of the content. However, a number of students they wished they could have a better understanding of the reasons behind the calculations, rather than memorizing the mathematical manipulations.\r\n\r\nStudents heaped praise on Professor Schotland, describing him as \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201centhusiastic,\u201d and \u201cenjoyable.\u201d Students also indicated that it was obvious Professor Schotland is knowledgeable about the subject, and he was \u201cgood at explaining difficult concepts in a simple manner.\u201d However, a number of students commented on his tardiness to classes.\r\n\r\nThis course is required for BE majors who are pursuing BSE degree. Prerequisites include MATH 241 or equivalent and PHYS 140/150. Students generally liked how the course was structured, with the weekly homework and quizzes to prepare for the tests. However, the midterms were not as challenging as the homework and quizzes, which many students felt the midterms could be more challenging to reflect their effort put into completing the more challenging assignments.\r\n", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/25655/sections/001/reviews/1796-JOHN-C--SCHOTLAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1796-JOHN-C--SCHOTLAND", "first_name": "JOHN C.", "last_name": "SCHOTLAND", "id": "1796-JOHN-C--SCHOTLAND", "name": "JOHN C.
