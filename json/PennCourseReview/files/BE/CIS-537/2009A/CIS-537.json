{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3320"}, "description": "This course covers the fundamentals of advanced quantitative image analysis that apply to all of the major and emerging modalities in biological/biomaterials imaging and in vivo biomedical imaging. While traditional image processing techniques will be discussed to provide context, the emphasis will be on cutting edge aspects of all areas of image analysis (including registration, segmentation, and high-dimensional statistical analysis). Significant coverage of state-of-the-art biomedical research and clinical applications will be incorporated to reinforce the theoretical basis of the analysis methods. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "BIOMED IMAGE ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15513/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.89", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "BIOMED IMAGE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-537-401", "path": "/courses/15513/sections/401", "id": "15513-401", "aliases": ["CIS-537-401", "BE-537-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/15513/sections/401/reviews/4284-PAUL-A--YUSHKEVICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4284-PAUL-A--YUSHKEVICH", "first_name": "PAUL A.", "last_name": "YUSHKEVICH", "id": "4284-PAUL-A--YUSHKEVICH", "name": "PAUL A.
