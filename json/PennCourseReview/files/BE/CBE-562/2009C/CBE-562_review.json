Topics include enzyme kinetics, cell-based screening, high-throughput screening, ADMET, FDA approval processes, and drug delivery.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course \u201cinteresting\u201d but the exams \u201creflect more on general chemistry [from freshman year of undergraduate study] and less on the course at hand.\u201d Many students indicated the lack of mathematical examples and the need for textbook and/or other supplementary materials and references for the class. Students also reported that the student presentations were \u201cuninteresting\u201d and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nStudents commented that Professor Diamond was \u201centhusiastic\u201d but \u201ctalks extremely fast\u201d that could result in missing critical information. Students gave mixed reviews about Professor Diamond\u2019s teaching style. A student praised his lectures as \u201cconcise\u201d and \u201clogical\u201d while another said they were \u201chard to follow\u201d and \u201cnot very helpful.\u201d \r\n\r\nAlthough it is a graduate class, undergraduate CBE majors may take it for concentration in pharmaceutics and biotechnology. \r\n", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/17065/sections/401/reviews/221-SCOTT-L--DIAMOND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/221-SCOTT-L--DIAMOND", "first_name": "SCOTT L.", "last_name": "DIAMOND", "id": "221-SCOTT-L--DIAMOND", "name": "SCOTT L.
