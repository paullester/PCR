Topics such as Fourier analysis of signals and systems, frequency analysis, frequency response, digital and analog filtering, and sampling are covered. \r\n\r\nStudents raved about Professor Rizk, agreeing that he is \u201cone of the best professors at Penn and definitely a huge asset to the BE department\u201d and that \u201cwhoever hired this professor deserves a reward.\u201d Students described Professor Rizk as \u201camazing\u201d, \u201cfriendly and approachable,\u201d \u201ca great communicator,\u201d and \u201centhusiastic about the subject material.\u201d Many came in hearing horror stories about the material, but were amazed by Professor Rizk\u2019s ability to communicate the difficult information. Students commented about Professor Rizk\u2019s great availability outside of his office hours and wish to have them understand the material. However, students did wish that more examples could be given in class, including those that were more representative of exam questions.\r\n\r\nStudents acknowledged that this course was difficult and that the homework required up to 10-15 hours to complete.  Overall, the work was \u201cchallenging but fair.\u201d Students were receptive to the final project, \u201ca great choice since it allowed us to apply the very abstract concepts we learned in class.\u201d  However, students felt that Professor Rizk \u201cdid his best to try and make it interesting\u201d and \u201cmaking such a complex topic more manageable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course is intended for BSE Bioengineering majors in their junior year. The prerequisites are BE 210 and MATH 241. Students complained about the workload for the course and the lack of examples that were representative of exam questions. \r\n", "num_students": 77, "path": "/courses/16994/sections/001/reviews/4750-MICHAEL-RIZK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4750-MICHAEL-RIZK", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "RIZK", "id": "4750-MICHAEL-RIZK", "name": "MICHAEL RIZK"}, "num_reviewers": 69, "id": "16994-001-4750-MICHAEL-RIZK"}]
