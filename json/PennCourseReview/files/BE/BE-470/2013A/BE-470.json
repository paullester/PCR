{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/186"}, "description": "Lab-based course where students learn the fundamentals of medical device design through hands-on projects using microcontrollers. Students first learn basic design building blocks regularly employed in microcontroller-based medical devices, and then carry out a small design project using those building blocks. Projects are informed by reverse-engineering of competing products, FDA regulations, and marketplace considerations. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MEDICAL DEVICES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29909/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.95", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "2.81", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.86", "rCommAbility": "2.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "MEDICAL DEVICES", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "BE-470-101", "path": "/courses/29909/sections/101", "id": "29909-101", "aliases": ["BE-470-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/29909/sections/101/reviews/162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN", "first_name": "DANIEL KENT", "last_name": "BOGEN", "id": "162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN", "name": "DANIEL KENT BOGEN"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "29909-101-162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-470", "path": "/courses/29909", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29909/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDICAL DEVICES", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "BE-470-101", "path": "/courses/29909/sections/101", "id": "29909-101", "aliases": ["BE-470-101"]}]}, "id": 29909, "aliases": ["BE-470"]}
