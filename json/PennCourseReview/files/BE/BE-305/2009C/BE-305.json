Students found most of the guest lectures to be interesting, but complained of a seeming disconnect between what is taught in the classroom and what is expected on homework and exams.\r\n\r\nStudents were not receptive to Professor Calderon, citing his inability to run a class and to integrate the lectures from the various guest lecturers, and his nonexistent administrative skills. Students complained that Professor Calderon was rarely at his office hours and difficult to get in touch with.\r\n\r\nThe course only had one midterm. Either this course, or BIOL 215, is a major requirement for Bioengineering majors. \r\n", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/16996/sections/001/reviews/4751-ANDRES-J--CALDERON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4751-ANDRES-J--CALDERON", "first_name": "ANDRES J.", "last_name": "CALDERON", "id": "4751-ANDRES-J--CALDERON", "name": "ANDRES J.
