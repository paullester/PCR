This class covers many\r\ntheoretical concepts, but overall students thought the material was \u201cstimulating\u201d and\r\n\u201cinteresting.\u201d Most of the material was taught through PowerPoints. Students reported\r\nlearning a lot from this course, but complained about difficulty synthesizing material due\r\nto it being difficult figuring out which slides were most important to study for exams. A\r\ndistinguishing feature of this class is the emphasis on guest lectures, which students said\r\nhad its pros and cons. As one student puts it, \u201cThe course is built from multiple guest\r\nlecturers who are researchers and physicians at Penn or HUP, who talk about various\r\nsections of physiology. Sometimes the course feels a bit disjointed due to the different\r\nlecture styles, but overall, the lecturers stimulated my interest. The exams were all\r\ncreated by one professor, so they felt fair.\u201d Students complained about different lecturers\r\ngoing at completely different speeds and how assignments did not match up well to the\r\nlectures.\r\nMauck, the main professor, teaches the three main \u201cchunks\u201d of the class and\r\nstudents state that his accessibility made this class one of their favorites at Penn.\r\nStudents reported that Mauck answered any emails to him within hours regularly.\r\nThe class is meant for third year bioengineering students. Students felt as if this\r\nclass was difficult but manageable, especially if you work in groups that can work\r\ntogether to decipher the at-times confusing homework assignments. Students also\r\ncomplained about the difficulty for studying for exams with a lot of dense material from\r\ndifferent lecturers and unclear direction on what material was most important to study.\r\nOne student stated, \u201cThe tests generally wound up being a lot easier than the material the\r\nlecturers spoke about, but you could never be sure so you had to try to study everything.\u201d", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/24030/sections/001/reviews/5589-ROBERT-L--MAUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5589-ROBERT-L--MAUCK", "first_name": "ROBERT L.", "last_name": "MAUCK", "id": "5589-ROBERT-L--MAUCK", "name": "ROBERT L.
