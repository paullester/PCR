{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1232"}, "description": "The course is intended as an introduction to continuum mechanics in both solid and fluid media, with special emphasis on the application to biomedical engineering. Once basic principles are established, the course will cover more advanced concepts in biosolid mechanics that include computational mechanics and bio-constitutive theory. Applications of these advanced concepts to current research problems will be emphasized. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "BIOMECH & BIOTRANS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27020/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.27", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "BIOMECH & BIOTRANS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-510-001", "path": "/courses/27020/sections/001", "id": "27020-001", "aliases": ["BE-510-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/27020/sections/001/reviews/5711-LEANN-M--DOURTE-SEGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5711-LEANN-M--DOURTE-SEGAN", "first_name": "LEANN M.", "last_name": "DOURTE SEGAN", "id": "5711-LEANN-M--DOURTE-SEGAN", "name": "LEANN M.
