{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1231"}, "description": "Introduction to the mathematical, physical and engineering design principles underlying modern medical imaging systems including x-ray computed tomography, ultrasonic imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging. Mathematical tools including Fourier analysis and the sampling theorem. The Radon transform and related transforms. Filtered backprojection and other reconstruction algorithms. Bloch equations, free induction decay, spin echoes and gradient echoes. Applications include one-dimensional Fourier magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and slice excitation. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "INTRO TO MED IMAGING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1351/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.44", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.44", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO MED IMAGING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-480-001", "path": "/courses/1351/sections/001", "id": "1351-001", "aliases": ["BE-480-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/1351/sections/001/reviews/1796-JOHN-C--SCHOTLAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1796-JOHN-C--SCHOTLAND", "first_name": "JOHN C.", "last_name": "SCHOTLAND", "id": "1796-JOHN-C--SCHOTLAND", "name": "JOHN C.
