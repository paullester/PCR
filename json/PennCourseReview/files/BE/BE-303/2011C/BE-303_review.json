The course emphasizes ethical\r\nissues related to the creation and use of technology, although other issues related to the\r\nprofessional development of engineers are also considered. The course involves\r\nextensive student presentations, analysis of case studies, role-playing, and debates in the\r\nanalysis of real-world situations involving ethical conflicts.\r\nStudents generally found the assigned readings lengthy and detached from the\r\nlecture material. In addition, many felt that the questions regarding the readings in the\r\nquizzes included too many details.
