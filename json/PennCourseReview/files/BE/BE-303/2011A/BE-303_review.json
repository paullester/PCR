The course makes extensive use of student group presentations and role-playing in the analysis of cases based on real-world problems with ethical dimensions. The case studies vary from year to year, but are chosen to reflect the full range of engineering fields and disciplines including areas of Bioengineering and Biomedical research.&#8232;&#8232;Although many students did not find the class as intriguing as they had hoped, some commented that they \u201clearned important skills about presentation and group work that aren't explored in many engineering classes.\u201d Many felt that the core of the class, the ethics of engineering, was not really delved into, and because of this, students felt unsatisfied at the end of the semester. &#8232;&#8232;The reaction to Professor Shih was a mixture; half the students described him as \u201capproachable\u201d and \u201caccessible,\u201d while the other half characterized him as \u201cdetached\u201d and not fully interested in the material, which they felt negatively affected the class\u2019s attitude.
