{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3290"}, "description": "Provides an overview of the ethical and professional responsibilities of engineers, as engineerng professionals, as members of engineering organizations, and as participants in medical or scientific research. The course will make extensive use of student group presentations and role playing in the analysis of cases based on real-world problems with ethical dimensions. The case studies will vary from year to year, but will be chosen to reflect the full range of engineering fields and disciplines including areas of Bioengineering and Biomedical research. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ETH/SOC/PRO RES FOR ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16995/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.49", "rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "1.34", "rRecommendMajor": "2.02", "rCourseQuality": "1.43", "rWorkRequired": "3.68", "rInstructorAccess": "2.40", "rReadingsValue": "1.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.94", "rCommAbility": "1.98", "rInstructorQuality": "1.80"}, "section": {"name": "ETH/SOC/PRO RES FOR ENG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-303-401", "path": "/courses/16995/sections/401", "id": "16995-401", "aliases": ["BE-303-401", "EAS-303-401"]}, "comments": "This course provides an overview of the ethical and professional responsibilities of engineers, making use of group presentations and role-playing using case studies.\r\n\r\nStudents found that they did not learn very much from the class, with one student claiming \u201ca 3 day seminar could have taught me all of the information that I learned in an entire semester.\u201d In general, they considered the course to be very time consuming loaded with busywork.
