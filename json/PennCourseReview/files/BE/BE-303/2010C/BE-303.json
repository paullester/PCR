The course will make extensive use of student group presentations and role playing in the analysis of cases based on real-world problems with ethical dimensions. The case studies will vary from year to year, but will be chosen to reflect the full range of engineering fields and disciplines including areas of Bioengineering and Biomedical research. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ETH/SOC/PRO RES FOR ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22683/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.40", "rDifficulty": "2.09", "rStimulateInterest": "1.53", "rRecommendMajor": "1.69", "rCourseQuality": "1.43", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.42", "rReadingsValue": "1.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.71", "rCommAbility": "1.98", "rInstructorQuality": "1.92"}, "section": {"name": "ETH/SOC/PRO RES FOR ENG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-303-401", "path": "/courses/22683/sections/401", "id": "22683-401", "aliases": ["BE-303-401", "EAS-303-401"]}, "comments": "BE 303 provides an overview of the ethical and professional responsibilities of engineers, as engineering professionals, as members of engineering organizations, and as participants in medical or scientific research.

The case studies used vary year-to-year based on current relevance. \r\n\r\nMany students found this class to be disorganized and \u201cvery repetitive at times.\u201d Most found that the case studies were too specific and did not cover bioethical subjects as widely as they could. Most students did not appreciate the workload for this course, stating, \u201cthere were simply too many assignments\u201d that \u201cquickly drain student interest.\u201d Several students described the work as \u201cbusywork.\u201d Some students found the class to be \u201cpointless\u201d and asked that the course be \u201crestructured\u201d because \u201cit needs a lot of work.\u201d \r\n\r\nMany students said that Professor Foster \u201cdoes not make the course interesting or enjoyable.\u201d They agreed that the professor is a \u201ckind\u201d and \u201cfriendly\u201d but \u201cnot a great professor.\u201d A majority of students found the course to be structured around Professor Foster\u2019s work with the course material \u201cbased on projects he was involved in.\u201d They did not appreciate the emphasis put on one particular subject, with one student stating, \u201cwe never had time to talk about [various subjects] because of his obsession with this one topic.\u201d \r\n\r\nSeveral students felt that this subject could be incorporated into other bioengineering classes. The course is required for bioengineering majors, but would not be recommended for non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/22683/sections/401/reviews/166-KENNETH-R-FOSTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/166-KENNETH-R-FOSTER", "first_name": "KENNETH R", "last_name": "FOSTER", "id": "166-KENNETH-R-FOSTER", "name": "KENNETH R FOSTER"}, "num_reviewers": 52, "id": "22683-401-166-KENNETH-R-FOSTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-303", "path": "/courses/22683", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22683/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETH/SOC/PRO RES FOR ENG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-303-401", "path": "/courses/22683/sections/401", "id": "22683-401", "aliases": ["BE-303-401", "EAS-303-401"]}]}, "id": 22683, "aliases": ["BE-303", "EAS-303"]}
