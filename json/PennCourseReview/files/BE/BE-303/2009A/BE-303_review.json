The course has a broader focus than a traditional \u201cengineering ethics\u201d course, but includes aspects of bioethics and research ethics to address needs of the many students at Penn who are headed for careers in medical research and practice.\r\n\r\nStudents seemed to appreciate the \u201cfruitful discussions\u201d and \u201cinsightful readings\u201d offered throughout the course, but were often disappointed by the disorganization of the class. An unsettling observation was that \u201cmost discussions end up in the realm of chemical or bioengineering\u201d and this sometimes \u201chandicapped\u201d students studying other disciplines.\r\n\r\nStudents called Dr. Shuster \u201cmuch too biased in teaching the course,\u201d even claiming that \u201cshe tells students regularly that [they are] wrong in ethical debates.\u201d Some students noted that the professor \u201cinterrupts every few minutes to inject her thoughts\u201d during class discussions, \u201cclouding\u201d the class\u2019s thoughts. Dr. Shuster was accessible for meeting outside of class, helping students to pursue extracurricular ethics interests and providing articles, advice, and even \u201ccontact information for a colleague who could help.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents found themselves forced to write papers with the teacher\u2019s and TA\u2019s opinions in mind rather than their own in order to maintain decent grades. However, the class was not particularly time-consuming, and there are no prerequisites.", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/15374/sections/401/reviews/4251-EVELYNE-SHUSTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4251-EVELYNE-SHUSTER", "first_name": "EVELYNE", "last_name": "SHUSTER", "id": "4251-EVELYNE-SHUSTER", "name": "EVELYNE SHUSTER"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "15374-401-4251-EVELYNE-SHUSTER"}]
