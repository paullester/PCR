There are lecture and recitation components, as well as 4 lab sessions over the course of the semester. All required materials are available via Blackboard.\r\n\r\nThe lab portion of the class was a good, hands-on introduction to the Biopac system as well as general lab equipment.\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that while they struggled due to lack of instruction on statistics and lab report writing, they enjoyed the class and felt it had educational value.\r\n\r\nStudents generally did not have a problem with the actual lab-work, but felt that writing lab reports in a scientific manner, as well as calculating the statistics necessary to complete the lab report, was never fully explained or taught. Many students felt that they did not understand how lab reports were graded, which contributed to their misunderstanding of how to write the lab reports.", "num_students": 122, "path": "/courses/12909/sections/001/reviews/163-SUSAN-S-MARGULIES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/163-SUSAN-S-MARGULIES", "first_name": "SUSAN S", "last_name": "MARGULIES", "id": "163-SUSAN-S-MARGULIES", "name": "SUSAN S MARGULIES"}, "num_reviewers": 120, "id": "12909-001-163-SUSAN-S-MARGULIES"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.42", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.07", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.28", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.86", "rCommAbility": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO BIOENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-100-001", "path": "/courses/12909/sections/001", "id": "12909-001", "aliases": ["BE-100-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 122, "path": "/courses/12909/sections/001/reviews/3899-BRITTANY-COATS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3899-BRITTANY-COATS", "first_name": "BRITTANY", "last_name": "COATS", "id": "3899-BRITTANY-COATS", "name": "BRITTANY COATS"}, "num_reviewers": 120, "id": "12909-001-3899-BRITTANY-COATS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-100", "path": "/courses/12909", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12909/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO BIOENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-100-001", "path": "/courses/12909/sections/001", "id": "12909-001", "aliases": ["BE-100-001"]}]}, "id": 12909, "aliases": ["BE-100"]}
