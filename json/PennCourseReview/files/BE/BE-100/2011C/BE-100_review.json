However, some believed that it was too easy and spent too much time\r\ntalking about different subdivisions within bioengineering and not enough time\r\ndiscussing the overall field. Many felt that topics covered in this course were generally\r\nbroad and did not go into too much detail. Many students wish the course spent more\r\ntime delving into each topic, rather than skimming over each topic briefly.\r\nStudents had no complaints about Professor Margulies, but wished that there were\r\nfewer guest lectures throughout the semester. Each guest lecturer would highlight his or\r\nher area of engineering, which \u201cwas an excellent way to showcase the types of research\r\nbeing done at Penn\u201d that the students could potentially get involved with.\r\nSome students commented that the course should be \u201cmade into a real, one credit\r\nclass with real work and learning,\u201d proposing a change from the current half credit\r\ncourse.
