Topics range from protein folding/forced unfolding to biomolecule associations, cell and membrane mechanics, and cell motility. Frequent hands-on exposure to modern methods in the field is a significant element of the course in the laboratory. \r\n\r\nMany students found this course to be \u201cdisorganized,\u201d as the professor used \u201cguest speakers\u201d that assign work. Several said that it was \u201cdifficult to keep track of\u201d so many different assignments from \u201cso many people.\u201d Some students stated that some of the post-docs were \u201cuncooperative\u201d and rude. In addition, several students wished that the assignments were based on concepts learned in class rather than the other way around. However, students generally agreed that the content of the class was \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cwell suited\u201d for graduate students. \r\n\r\nCBE 555 is a graduate level course, but is open to seniors. Students would recommend this course only for major-students. \r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 8 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/22757/sections/401/reviews/772-DENNIS-E--DISCHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/772-DENNIS-E--DISCHER", "first_name": "DENNIS E.", "last_name": "DISCHER", "id": "772-DENNIS-E--DISCHER", "name": "DENNIS E.
