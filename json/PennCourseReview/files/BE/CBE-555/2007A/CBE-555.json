{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2996"}, "description": "From single molecule studies to single cell manipulations, the broad field of cell and molecular biology is becoming increasingly quantitative and increasingly a matter of systems simplification and analysis. The elaboration of various stresses on cellular structures, influences of interaction pathways and convolutions of incessant thermal motions will be discussed via lectures and laboratory demonstration. Topics will range from, but are not limited to, protein folding/forced unfolding to biomolecule associations, cell and membrane mechanics, and cell motility, drawing from very recent examples in the literature. Frequent hands-on exposure to modern methods in the field will be a significant element of the course in the laboratory. Skills in analytical and professional presentations, papers and laboratory work will be developed. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "NANOSCALE SYSTEMS BIOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14200/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "1.73", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.27", "rCommAbility": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "2.47"}, "section": {"name": "NANOSCALE SYSTEMS BIOL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CBE-555-401", "path": "/courses/14200/sections/401", "id": "14200-401", "aliases": ["CBE-555-401", "BE-555-401", "BE-444-401", "CBE-444-401", "MEAM-555-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/14200/sections/401/reviews/772-DENNIS-E--DISCHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/772-DENNIS-E--DISCHER", "first_name": "DENNIS E.", "last_name": "DISCHER", "id": "772-DENNIS-E--DISCHER", "name": "DENNIS E.
