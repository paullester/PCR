{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4160"}, "description": "This course is a continuation of the course Fundamental Techniques of Imaging 1 (BE546). It builds upon the fall course instruction and continues to expose students to the fundamentals of modern techniques in biological and in vivo biomedical imaging. This course consists of a series of hands-on lab exercises, covering major imaging modalities, but also extends to non-radiology modalities of interest in biological, pathological or animal imaging (e.g., optical imaging). Topics include SPECT, Micro-CT, diffuse optical spectroscopy, in vivo fluorescence imaging, and computed tomography. The course will continue to emphasize the hands-on aspects of all areas of imaging and imaging analysis. Small groups of students will be led by a faculty member with technical assistance as appropriate. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "FUND TECH OF IMAGING 2", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25669/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "FUND TECH OF IMAGING 2", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-547-001", "path": "/courses/25669/sections/001", "id": "25669-001", "aliases": ["BE-547-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/25669/sections/001/reviews/4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY", "first_name": "EDWARD JAMES", "last_name": "DELIKATNY", "id": "4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY", "name": "EDWARD JAMES DELIKATNY"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "25669-001-4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-547", "path": "/courses/25669", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25669/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUND TECH OF IMAGING 2", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-547-001", "path": "/courses/25669/sections/001", "id": "25669-001", "aliases": ["BE-547-001"]}]}, "id": 25669, "aliases": ["BE-547"]}
