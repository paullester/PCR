{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4160"}, "description": "This course is a continuation of the course Fundamental Techniques of Imaging 1 (BE546). It builds upon the fall course instruction and continues to expose students to the fundamentals of modern techniques in biological and in vivo biomedical imaging. This course consists of a series of hands-on lab exercises, covering major imaging modalities, but also extends to non-radiology modalities of interest in biological, pathological or animal imaging (e.g., optical imaging). Topics include SPECT, Micro-CT, diffuse optical spectroscopy, in vivo fluorescence imaging, and computed tomography. The course will continue to emphasize the hands-on aspects of all areas of imaging and imaging analysis. Small groups of students will be led by a faculty member with technical assistance as appropriate. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "FUND TECH OF IMAGING 2", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21328/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "FUND TECH OF IMAGING 2", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-547-001", "path": "/courses/21328/sections/001", "id": "21328-001", "aliases": ["BE-547-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/21328/sections/001/reviews/4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY", "first_name": "EDWARD JAMES", "last_name": "DELIKATNY", "id": "4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY", "name": "EDWARD JAMES DELIKATNY"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "21328-001-4253-EDWARD-JAMES-DELIKATNY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-547", "path": "/courses/21328", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21328/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUND TECH OF IMAGING 2", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-547-001", "path": "/courses/21328/sections/001", "id": "21328-001", "aliases": ["BE-547-001"]}]}, "id": 21328, "aliases": ["BE-547"]}
