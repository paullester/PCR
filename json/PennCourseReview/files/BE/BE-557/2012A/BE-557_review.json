We will try to understand the interplay between molecules in cells and cell function.  A particular focus is on receptors - cell surface molecules that mediate cell responses.  We will also try to understand processes such as adhesion, motility, cytoskeleton, signal transduction, differentiation, and gene regulation. \r\n\r\nOne student described the course structure as \u201c35 papers that [the professor] found meaningful and interesting throughout [his] career.\u201d Another noted that it was the first grad course to teach him how to \u201ccritically evaluate literature.\u201d Students appreciated the \u201cin-depth talks\u201d about each paper, and felt that after every lecture they \u201cwalked away learning one more thing about science.\u201d They also highlighted the profound integration of biology into engineering in this course.\r\n\r\nStudents were universal in their praise for Dr. Chen, whom they described as having \u201cworked at the forefront of his field,\u201d and is \u201cincredibly well-spoken with a gift to teach and stimulate interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is a graduate course in bioengineering, and was highly recommended for all in the department, even advanced undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThis course review was written based on the 7 students comments submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/27025/sections/401/reviews/2873-CHRISTOPHER-S--CHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2873-CHRISTOPHER-S--CHEN", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER S.", "last_name": "CHEN", "id": "2873-CHRISTOPHER-S--CHEN", "name": "CHRISTOPHER S.
