Focusing on receptors, the cell surface molecules that mediate cell responses, this course will describe the interwoven attributes between molecules in cells and cell function. Other covered topics include adhesion, motility, cytoskeleton, signal transduction, differentiation, and gene regulation.&#8232;&#8232;Students generally found the course to be \u201csuperb\u201d and \u201cfantastic.\u201d Some students reported that it was \u201cone of the best courses [they\u2019ve] taken at Penn,\u201d and not \u201cjust because of what [they] learned in terms of the field of cell mechanics... but [also] the science in general.\u201d One student reported that this course made \u201ccoming to Penn for [his] Master\u2019s in [Bioengineering] worthwhile\u201d.&#8232;&#8232;Students generally enjoyed the structure of the course set out by Professor Chen, which was \u201cto take a high profile professor in bioengineering and have him guide the class through the 50+ papers that have influenced his thinking.\u201d Students stated that the professor made \u201cstudents interested in the material\u201d and that he was a \u201cdynamic professor.\u201d One criticism was that the course structure restricted personal contribution from Professor Chen, since each paper was presented by a different group of students.
