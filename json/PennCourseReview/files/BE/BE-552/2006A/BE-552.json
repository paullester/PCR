{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1697"}, "description": "The goal of this course is to introduce students quantitative concepts in understanding and manipulating the behavior of biological cells. We will try to understand the interplay between molecules in cells and cell function. A particular focus is on receptors - cell surface molecules that mediate cell responses. We will also try to understand processes such as adhesion, motility, cytoskeleton, signal transduction, differentiation, and gene regulation. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "CELLULAR ENGINEERING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7379/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.53", "rCommAbility": "3.35", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "CELLULAR ENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-552-401", "path": "/courses/7379/sections/401", "id": "7379-401", "aliases": ["BE-552-401", "CBE-552-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/7379/sections/401/reviews/2873-CHRISTOPHER-S--CHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2873-CHRISTOPHER-S--CHEN", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER S.", "last_name": "CHEN", "id": "2873-CHRISTOPHER-S--CHEN", "name": "CHRISTOPHER S.
