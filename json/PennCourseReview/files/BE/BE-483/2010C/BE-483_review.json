The basic principles of X-ray, computed tomography, nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and optical tomography will be reviewed. The emphasis of the course, however, will focus on the concept of contrast media and targeted molecular imaging. Topics that are covered include the chemistry and mechanisms of various contrast agents, approaches to identifying molecular markers of disease, ligand screening strategies, and the basic principles of toxicology and pharmacology relevant to imaging agents.\r\n\r\nAccording to many students, the course covered numerous topics and provided a \u201cvery good overview of medical imaging.\u201d One student feared that \u201cthere would be too much explicit physics, but Dr. T. did a very good job of presenting the material in sufficient depth but without too much complexity.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents reported that throughout the semester, many guest lecturers spoke to the class. Most students believed that \u201cbringing in the experts of each field was really nice,\u201d but that \u201ca lot of the guest lecturers were not at the same level [as Professor Tsourkas].\u201d Many commented that the course would be better without the guest lecturers, as \u201cit was difficult to adjust to the different guest lecturer's teaching styles.\u201d However, it was unanimous among students that Professor Tsourkas was an \u201cexcellent professor\u201d and that his slides were \u201cwell written and very organized.\u201d Another student commented that \u201cthere was a lot of information to get through, and I think that Dr. Tsourkas did a good job of communicating the basics of each modality.\u201d Most students \u201cenjoyed the class\u201d and some were inspired to \u201ctake more advanced imaging courses in the future.\u201d\r\n\r\nGrades for the course were based on four exams and four homework assignments, each of which coverd a different imaging modality. \u201cThere ended up being a lot of material for each exam because one had to go through Professor Tsourkas' notes for one lecture as well as the guest lectures' notes,\u201d one student noted. \r\n\r\nStudents generally found that \u201cneither the exams nor the homework were very hard\u201d and that they learned a lot of new material overall. One student summed it up when he said, \u201cthis felt like one of the first BE classes that taught applicable and useful information.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/22687/sections/401/reviews/2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "TSOURKAS", "id": "2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS", "name": "ANDREW TSOURKAS"}, "num_reviewers": 55, "id": "22687-401-2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS"}]
