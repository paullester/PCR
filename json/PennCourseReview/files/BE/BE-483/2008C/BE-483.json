{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3291"}, "description": "This course will provide a comprehensive survey of modern medical imaging modalities with an emphasis on the emerging field of molecular imaging. The basic principles of X-ray, computed tomography, nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and optical tomography will be reviewed. The emphasis of the course, however, will focus on the concept of contrast media and targeted molecular imaging. Topics to be covered include the chemistry and mechanisms of various contrast agents, approaches to identifying molecular markers of disease, ligand screening strategies, and the basic principles of toxicology and pharmacology relevant to imaging agents. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "MOLECULAR IMAGING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18327/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "2.06", "rRecommendMajor": "2.74", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.37", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.03", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.23", "rCommAbility": "2.46", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "MOLECULAR IMAGING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-483-401", "path": "/courses/18327/sections/401", "id": "18327-401", "aliases": ["BE-483-401", "BE-583-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/18327/sections/401/reviews/2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "TSOURKAS", "id": "2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS", "name": "ANDREW TSOURKAS"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "18327-401-2869-ANDREW-TSOURKAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-483", "path": "/courses/18327", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18327/sections", "values": [{"name": "MOLECULAR IMAGING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-483-401", "path": "/courses/18327/sections/401", "id": "18327-401", "aliases": ["BE-483-401", "BE-583-401"]}]}, "id": 18327, "aliases": ["BE-483", "BE-583"]}
