Consideration is given to issues of biocompatibility, degradation of materials by the biologic systems, and biologic response to artificial materials. Particular attention is given to the materials of total hip and knee prostheses and their relationship to the long-term outcomes in hip and knee arthroplasty.\r\n\r\nStudents generally described this course as \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cfascinating.\u201d They said that it took a good bit of work, but it was \u201cpretty worth it.\u201d In this course, there was a daily quiz component, which a student claimed was \u201cvery effective in making sure [the students] got the most out of lectures and understood the content.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students gave positive feedback about Dr. Winey. One student reported that she was \u201cfrank about material covered on exams\u201d and had \u201can engaging conversational style of teaching.\u201d Students said that she did \u201ca great job of going over and clarifying the subject matter.\u201d Some students even claimed that she was their favorite professor at Penn.\r\n\r\nThis course received fairly high ratings from students. It is a requirement for all MSE majors, but it was also recommended to non-majors.\r\n\r\nThis review was based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/23470/sections/001/reviews/842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "first_name": "KAREN I.", "last_name": "WINEY", "id": "842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "name": "KAREN I.
