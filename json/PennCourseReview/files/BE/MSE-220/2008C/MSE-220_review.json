Important topics include corrosion, material structures, phase diagrams, polymers, composites, and metal fatigue. Structural Materials is required for the course and tutorials available on CD and CETS computers provide preparation for class discussions.\r\n\r\nStudents found the content of the course to enjoyable and very interesting. Many noted that they \u201clearned a lot\u201d and one called it \u201cone of my favorite after four years at Penn.\u201d Quizzes were given at the beginning of every class, and for the most part, students praised this system for making them keep up with the material.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, students greatly enjoyed Professor Winey. Students found that she did a great job stimulating their interest and encouraging their success in the course. Some used words like \u201centhusiastic\u201d and \u201cmagnificent\u201d to describe her teaching abilities. The course was taught in a question-and-answer format much like a recitation, but students had mixed opinions on the system. Some said that it taught them the concepts well, but others explained that it was \u201cpoorly structured\u201d and wished it were taught more like a lecture.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of chemistry (CHEM 101 or equivalent) and basic calculus is required to take this course. Students reported that the course required \u201ca lot of work\u201d and most of the course was self-taught.", "num_students": 55, "path": "/courses/19008/sections/001/reviews/842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "first_name": "KAREN I.", "last_name": "WINEY", "id": "842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "name": "KAREN I.
