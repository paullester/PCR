{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/771"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Materials Science through an examination of the structure, property, performance relationship for synthetic and biologic structural materials with a focus on surgical implants and medical devices. Consideration is given to issues of biocompatibility, degradation of materials by the biologic systems, and biologic response to artificial materials. Particular attention will be given to the materials of total hip and knee prostheses and their relationship to the long term outcomes in hip and knee arthroplasty. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ENGINEERING MATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1940/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.84", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.26", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "ENGINEERING MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-220-001", "path": "/courses/1940/sections/001", "id": "1940-001", "aliases": ["MSE-220-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/1940/sections/001/reviews/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "first_name": "DAVID P", "last_name": "POPE", "id": "835-DAVID-P-POPE", "name": "DAVID P POPE"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "1940-001-835-DAVID-P-POPE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-220", "path": "/courses/1940", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1940/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENGINEERING MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-220-001", "path": "/courses/1940/sections/001", "id": "1940-001", "aliases": ["MSE-220-001"]}]}, "id": 1940, "aliases": ["MSE-220"]}
