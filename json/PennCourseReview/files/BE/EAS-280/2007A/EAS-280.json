{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3048"}, "description": "Open to all majors at Penn, this course explores the wide-range of bioengineering applications 'in the world' and then takes these concepts 'into the world' by teaching them to a small group of students at the high school level. Students will learn fundamental concepts behind bioengineering applications such as Gene Therapy, Stem Cells, Neuroengineering, Tissue Engineering, Biomechanics, Imaging, and Medical Devices. They will also develop effective methods for teaching technical concepts. At the high school, the Penn students will perform hands-on activities with the high school students, discuss ethical questions related to each topic, and explore career options. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "BIOENG IN THE WORLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14326/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.18", "rDifficulty": "1.06", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.35", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "1.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.59", "rReadingsValue": "2.41", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.76", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "BIOENG IN THE WORLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-280-401", "path": "/courses/14326/sections/401", "id": "14326-401", "aliases": ["EAS-280-401", "BE-280-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/14326/sections/401/reviews/2918-DAWN-ELLIOTT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2918-DAWN-ELLIOTT", "first_name": "DAWN", "last_name": "ELLIOTT", "id": "2918-DAWN-ELLIOTT", "name": "DAWN ELLIOTT"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "14326-401-2918-DAWN-ELLIOTT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-280", "path": "/courses/14326", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14326/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOENG IN THE WORLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-280-401", "path": "/courses/14326/sections/401", "id": "14326-401", "aliases": ["EAS-280-401", "BE-280-401"]}]}, "id": 14326, "aliases": ["EAS-280", "BE-280"]}
