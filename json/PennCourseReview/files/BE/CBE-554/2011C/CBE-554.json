However, they\r\nseemed overwhelmed by the amount of material covered in each class and found the\r\ntextbook useless. One student suggested that the class would be better as two 1.5 hour\r\nclasses instead of one 3 hour class per week. A large aspect of the class that was\r\ngenerally disliked was the group-work, which was seen as a burden.\r\nThe professor's teaching ability was above standards, and, according to one\r\nstudent, \u201chis knowledge base is awe-inspiring.\u201d However, it was the general consensus\r\nthat \u201cthe lectures [were] difficult to follow as the material [was] gone through incredibly\r\nquickly.\u201d\r\nOverall, the emphasis on mathematics suggests that this class is directed primarily\r\ntowards engineering students.
