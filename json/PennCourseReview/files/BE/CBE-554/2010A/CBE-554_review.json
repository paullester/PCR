This course is cross-listed with BE 554.\r\n\r\nStudents reported that the course covered \u201cinterested topics \u2026 in enough detail\u201d. Some topics were, however, unclear. Students felt that the lectures often \u201ctook for granted knowledge of cellular/genetic processes\u201d and \u201citems of important detail were glazed over\u201d. The lectures were \u201cmath-centered\u201d, and \u201cdifficult to get through or even understand\u201d. The assignments were not met with enthusiasm. The homework sets were not reflective of the difficulty of the exams, group papers were \u201cinefficient\u201d, and the final group project \u201cended up being superficial\u201d because at students felt they didn\u2019t have the skills to \u201ccomplete it in the [sufficient] detail\u201d. The exams were also \u201clong and hard\u201d, and students wished there was \u201cmore focus on concepts rather than equations\u201d, and that they had more time to \u201cthink about the problems rather than rush through them\u201d.\r\n\r\nDr Diamond was hailed to be a good lecturer, and students reported that he communicated the subject matter fairly well, and was fairly accessible.\r\n\r\nThis course was highly recommended for majors, but not so much for non-engineers. This course \u201cwould not be helpful to someone who doesn\u2019t want to go into the Biotech or Pharma area\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis review was based on 8 comments.
