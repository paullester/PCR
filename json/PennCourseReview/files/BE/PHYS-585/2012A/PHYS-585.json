{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5017"}, "description": "This course will develop theoretical and computational approaches to structural and functional organization in the brain. The course will cover: (i) the basic biophysics of neural responses, (ii) neural coding and decoding with an emphasis on sensory systems, (iii) approaches to the study of networks of neurons, (iv) models of adaptation, learning and memory, (v) models of decision making, and (vi) ideas that address why the brain is organized the way that it is. The course will be appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. A knowledge of multi-variable calculus, linear algebra and differential equations is required (except by permission of the instructor). Prior exposure to neuroscience and/or Matlab programming will be helpful. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "THEORETICAL NEUROSCIENCE: Theoretical and computational neuroscience", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28023/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.16", "rReadingsValue": "2.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "THEORETICAL NEUROSCIENCE: Theoretical and computational neuroscience", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-585-401", "path": "/courses/28023/sections/401", "id": "28023-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-585-401", "PSYC-539-401", "BE-530-401", "NGG-594-401", "BIBB-585-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/28023/sections/401/reviews/972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN", "first_name": "VIJAY", "last_name": "BALASUBRAMANIAN", "id": "972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN", "name": "VIJAY BALASUBRAMANIAN"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "28023-401-972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-585", "path": "/courses/28023", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28023/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORETICAL NEUROSCIENCE: Theoretical and computational neuroscience", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-585-401", "path": "/courses/28023/sections/401", "id": "28023-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-585-401", "PSYC-539-401", "BE-530-401", "NGG-594-401", "BIBB-585-401"]}]}, "id": 28023, "aliases": ["PHYS-585", "PSYC-539", "BE-530", "NGG-594", "BIBB-585"]}
