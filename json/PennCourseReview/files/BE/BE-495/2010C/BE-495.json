The course is open only to BE Seniors. \r\n\r\nMany students had felt that this class was a waste of time, especially those who didn\u2019t plan to become a professional engineer. A majority of the students felt that the lectures were rather pointless and also scheduled at a time that conflicted with review sessions. Students reported that the class was \u201cbased almost entirely in the lab,\u201d and many felt that they didn\u2019t \u201cdidn\u2019t get too much out of\u201d \u201cthe attempts to make it a \u2018class.\u2019\u201d Students generally found the biweekly reports and project brief to be \u201ctedious\u201d and \u201credundant.\u201d  Another issue that some students had with this class was that they felt that the projects weren\u2019t screened properly or selected carefully. As a result, several groups had to \u201cstruggle to mold their projects into a design process that matched the course's objectives\u201d because in some cases, \u201cthe clients did not actually have a senior design appropriate project.\u201d Several students also felt that there wasn\u2019t any support available to them and that they struggled to figure out the solutions themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Winkelstein is listed as the instructor for the course, each design group had a different assigned professor.  Students generally wished that Dr. Winkelstein had designed the course better, and each group had different experiences with their professors and their clients.\r\n\r\nStudents generally agreed that \u201cthe differentiation between design and research was valuable to realize.\u201d The consultant-client relationship emphasized was described as \u201cinteresting and probably industry-relevant.\u201d The course helped students to \u201ceffectively work well in groups.\u201d However, the course received low ratings, and students generally didn\u2019t feel that they learned much from it. This course is required for all BE majors, and it was not recommended for non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/22690/sections/001/reviews/1795-BETH-A--WINKELSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1795-BETH-A--WINKELSTEIN", "first_name": "BETH A.", "last_name": "WINKELSTEIN", "id": "1795-BETH-A--WINKELSTEIN", "name": "BETH A.
