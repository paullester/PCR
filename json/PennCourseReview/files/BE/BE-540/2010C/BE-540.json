{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5077"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the quantitative methods used in characterizing and engineering biomolecular properties and cellular behavior, focusing primarily on receptor-mediated phenomena. The thermodynamics and kinetics of protein/ligand binding are covered, with an emphasis on experimental techniques for measuring molecular parameters such as equilibrium affinities, kinetic rate constants, and diffusion coefficients. Approaches for probing and altering these molecular properties of proteins are also described, including site-directed mutagenesis, directed evolution, rational design, and covalent modification. Equilibrium, kinetic, and transport models are used to elucidate the relationships between the aforementioned molecular parameters and cellular processes such as ligand/receptor binding and trafficking, cell adhesion and motility, signal transduction, and gene regulation. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22693/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.74", "rDifficulty": "3.59", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "2.76", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.12", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-540-401", "path": "/courses/22693/sections/401", "id": "22693-401", "aliases": ["BE-540-401", "CBE-540-401"]}, "comments": "This course provides an introduction to the quantitative methods used in characterizing and engineering biomolecular properties and cellular behavior, focusing primarily on receptor-mediated phenomena.

They felt like they learned a lot from the lectures. Some students wished that \u201cmore classes could be of similar quality.\u201d They felt comfortable with the layout of this graduate-level course and thought that the lecture material \u201cseemed to build in an appropriate and useful way.\u201d However, some students did express that they wished that course material would have included more in-depth analysis. \r\n\r\nMany students shared the opinion that Dr. Sarkar was able to present the course material in a \u201cstructured and comprehendible manner.\u201d However, some did believe that he was not able to \u201cstimulate [enough] conversation\u201d during the lecture, and he did not work out enough examples in class. This led to a gap between the lecture material and homework expectations. But, overall, students were very pleased with Dr. Sarkar\u2019s teaching ability. They generally agreed that Dr. Sarkar \u201cgenuinely cares\u201d about students understanding the material. \r\n\r\nThis course was very difficult for many of the undergraduates that took it. Students seemed to feel that the homework and exam material were much harder than the material that was covered in class.\r\n", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/22693/sections/401/reviews/2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "first_name": "CASIM A.", "last_name": "SARKAR", "id": "2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "name": "CASIM A.
