{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5077"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the quantitative methods used in characterizing and engineering biomolecular properties and cellular behavior, focusing primarily on receptor-mediated phenomena. The thermodynamics and kinetics of protein/ligand binding are covered, with an emphasis on experimental techniques for measuring molecular parameters such as equilibrium affinities, kinetic rate constants, and diffusion coefficients. Approaches for probing and altering these molecular properties of proteins are also described, including site-directed mutagenesis, directed evolution, rational design, and covalent modification. Equilibrium, kinetic, and transport models are used to elucidate the relationships between the aforementioned molecular parameters and cellular processes such as ligand/receptor binding and trafficking, cell adhesion and motility, signal transduction, and gene regulation. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29919/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.06", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.56", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-540-401", "path": "/courses/29919/sections/401", "id": "29919-401", "aliases": ["BE-540-401", "CBE-540-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/29919/sections/401/reviews/2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "first_name": "CASIM A.", "last_name": "SARKAR", "id": "2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "name": "CASIM A.
