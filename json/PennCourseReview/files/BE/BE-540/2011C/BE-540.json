{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5077"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the quantitative methods used in characterizing and engineering biomolecular properties and cellular behavior, focusing primarily on receptor-mediated phenomena. The thermodynamics and kinetics of protein/ligand binding are covered, with an emphasis on experimental techniques for measuring molecular parameters such as equilibrium affinities, kinetic rate constants, and diffusion coefficients. Approaches for probing and altering these molecular properties of proteins are also described, including site-directed mutagenesis, directed evolution, rational design, and covalent modification. Equilibrium, kinetic, and transport models are used to elucidate the relationships between the aforementioned molecular parameters and cellular processes such as ligand/receptor binding and trafficking, cell adhesion and motility, signal transduction, and gene regulation. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24040/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.26", "rDifficulty": "3.65", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "2.96", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "3.04", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.04", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-540-401", "path": "/courses/24040/sections/401", "id": "24040-401", "aliases": ["BE-540-401", "CBE-540-401"]}, "comments": "This course introduces the quantitative methods used in characterizing and\r\nengineering biomolecular properties and cellular behavior, focusing primarily on\r\nreceptor-mediated phenomena.

As a student puts it, \u201cYou learn a lot, but you are expected to pay close\r\nattention in lecture and work hard.\u201d Students reported learning a lot of material in the\r\ncourse. A student reported, \u201cThe heavy emphasis on biomolecular interactions in the first\r\npart of the course provided an excellent foundation for the rest of the course.\u201d Students\r\nalso enjoyed the \u201cgood integration of papers into what we were learning and connecting\r\nthe course from start to finish.\u201d Another student comments about the pace of the course,\r\n\u201cThe course builds well, had a good number of problem sets and outside-of-class work\r\n(not too much/little) and fair exams.\u201d\r\nSakar was commended on being a \u201cvery good professor.\u201d Students enjoyed the\r\nformat of the class where you are \u201cable to get student participation & have some\r\ndiscussion about the topics to help us understand them.\u201d Students wished there were\r\nmore classes at Penn that taught as much as this class.\r\nThis class is meant for graduate students in Bioengineering. Advanced\r\nundergraduate students also could take it, but most stated it was very difficult and\r\nexperience in chemical engineering was basically necessary. Students felt that this class\r\nwas very difficult but rewarding. Students wished that more class time were dedicated to\r\nproblem solving, as the problem sets were very difficult on material that went beyond\r\nwhat was taught in class. Students thought the exams were tough but fair, \u201cexams were\r\nkind of on long side, but questions themselves were fair.\u201d\r\nThis review is based on the 7 student reviews that were submitted.", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/24040/sections/401/reviews/2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "first_name": "CASIM A.", "last_name": "SARKAR", "id": "2871-CASIM-A--SARKAR", "name": "CASIM A.
