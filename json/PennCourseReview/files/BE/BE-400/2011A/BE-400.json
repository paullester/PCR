Almost all students shared the opinion that the most valuable part of this class was the preceptorship. They described this experience as \u201ceducational\u201d and \u201cenjoyable.\u201d One student went so far as to say that the preceptorship was one of the \u201cmost memorable academic experiences to date.\u201d Aside from the preceptorship, most students did not find the in-class lectures to be as interesting and fulfilling. &#8232;&#8232;Students were generally not very pleased with Professor Eckmann. Many described him as \u201ccondescending\u201d and \u201carrogant.\u201d They also thought that Professor Eckmann was not very clear in his instructions when he assigned essay topics. &#8232;&#8232;Students reported that this course required a lot of work, especially when lectures and essays were joined with work for the preceptorship. In addition, students felt that Professor Eckmann graded papers subjectively.
