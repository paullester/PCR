{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4893"}, "description": "The course is geared to advanced undergraduate and graduate students interested in understanding the basics ofimplantable neuro-devices, their design, practical implementation, approval, and use. Reading will cover the basics of neuro signals, recording, analysis, classification, modulation, and fundamental principels of Brain-Machine Interfaces. The course will be based upon twic weekly lectures and \"hands-on\" weekly assignments that teach basic signal recording, feature extraction, classification and practical implementation in clinical systems. Assignments will build incrementally toward constructing a complete, functional BMI system. Fundamental concepts in neurosignals, hardware and software will be reinforced by practical examples and in-depth study. Guest lecturers and demonstrations will supplement regular lectures. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25668/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.48", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-521-401", "path": "/courses/25668/sections/401", "id": "25668-401", "aliases": ["BE-521-401", "INSC-521-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/25668/sections/401/reviews/4252-BRIAN-LITT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4252-BRIAN-LITT", "first_name": "BRIAN", "last_name": "LITT", "id": "4252-BRIAN-LITT", "name": "BRIAN LITT"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "25668-401-4252-BRIAN-LITT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-521", "path": "/courses/25668", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25668/sections", "values": [{"name": "BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-521-401", "path": "/courses/25668/sections/401", "id": "25668-401", "aliases": ["BE-521-401", "INSC-521-401"]}]}, "id": 25668, "aliases": ["BE-521", "INSC-521"]}
