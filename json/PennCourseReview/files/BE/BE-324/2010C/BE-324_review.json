Junior standing is required for this course.\r\n\r\nMany students reported that during class there was so much copying from the board that needed to be done that there was very little time to \u201cactually absorb the concepts.\u201d Several students felt that the test and homework questions were difficult, but reported that the class \u201cusually [covered] the course material well.\u201d However, some felt that the homework and the example problems were \u201cmiles apart in difficulty.\u201d Many students had trouble understanding how the physical chemistry they learned about in the course \u201c[connected] to real world situations.\u201d At the same time, they felt that \u201c[the] emphasis on biological examples in a physical chemistry course was very illuminating and refreshing.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe general opinion towards Dr Hammer was a positive one. Many students claimed that he was the best teacher they'd had at Penn. They described him as an \u201ceffective and engaging lecturer\u201d and reported that he was able to effectively explain concepts and \u201c[convey] the subject matter\u201d to them. His availability outside of the classroom, in office hours, and during review sessions was very much appreciated. The only complaints were that at times the professor seemed to display a lack of professionalism, and he sometimes \u201c[failed] to relate the significance of formulas in terms of their conceptual meanings.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, students considered this to be a good course because the instructor was good at explaining course content, was accessible for help, and was able to stimulate students\u2019 interest in the material, even those who didn't like chemistry. Many students reported that the course was quite difficult and required a lot of work. This course is required for all BE majors, and it wasn\u2019t recommended to non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/22685/sections/001/reviews/160-DANIEL-A--HAMMER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/160-DANIEL-A--HAMMER", "first_name": "DANIEL A.", "last_name": "HAMMER", "id": "160-DANIEL-A--HAMMER", "name": "DANIEL A.
