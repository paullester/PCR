{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4519"}, "description": "Continuum mechanics with applications to biological systems. Fundamental engineering conservation laws are introduced and illustrated using biological and non-biological examples. Kinematics of deformation, stress, and conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. Constitutive equations for fluids, solids, and intermediate types of media are described and applied to selected biological examples. Class work is complemented by hands-on experimental and computational laboratory experiences. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "CONTINUUM BIOMECHANICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16999/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.60", "rDifficulty": "3.60", "rStimulateInterest": "1.20", "rRecommendMajor": "1.40", "rCourseQuality": "1.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "1.80", "rReadingsValue": "1.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.40", "rCommAbility": "1.40", "rInstructorQuality": "1.00"}, "section": {"name": "CONTINUUM BIOMECHANICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BE-455-401", "path": "/courses/16999/sections/401", "id": "16999-401", "aliases": ["BE-455-401", "MEAM-544-401", "MEAM-455-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/16999/sections/401/reviews/4751-ANDRES-J--CALDERON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4751-ANDRES-J--CALDERON", "first_name": "ANDRES J.", "last_name": "CALDERON", "id": "4751-ANDRES-J--CALDERON", "name": "ANDRES J.
