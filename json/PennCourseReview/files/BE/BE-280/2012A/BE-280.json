{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5374"}, "description": "This course will provide Penn undergraduate students with the opportunity to learn fundamental engineering concepts behind a wide-range of bioengineering applications in the world. Students will reinforce their learning of these conceptsby teaching them to middle school students through the development of hands-on teaching modules. \n\nFor the Spring 2012 semester, this will take place at Girard College in Philadelphia. Students will spend the first half of the class working together with interactive discussions on important bioengineering topics and in developing the teaching modules. The second half will be spent delivering the modules to middle school students at Girard College. Grading will be based on participation, project development, and reports. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "BIOENG IN THE WORLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27008/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.29", "rDifficulty": "0.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "BIOENG IN THE WORLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-280-001", "path": "/courses/27008/sections/001", "id": "27008-001", "aliases": ["BE-280-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/27008/sections/001/reviews/3227-JASON-A--BURDICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3227-JASON-A--BURDICK", "first_name": "JASON A.", "last_name": "BURDICK", "id": "3227-JASON-A--BURDICK", "name": "JASON A.
