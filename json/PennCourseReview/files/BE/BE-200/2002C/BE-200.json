{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1687"}, "description": "This course investigates the application of statics and dynamics to simple force analyses of the musculoskeletal system, introduces the fundamentals of the mechanics of materials, and introduces the biomechanics of soft and hard tissues (e.g, microstructure and mechanical properties). The first portion of the course will present fundamental concepts of force and mechanics of rigid and deformable bodies. The remainder of the course will consist of an introduction of materials science and engineering, including the classification and bulk properties of implantable materials. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "INTRO TO BIOMECHANICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2662/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.44", "rDifficulty": "2.72", "rStimulateInterest": "1.08", "rRecommendMajor": "2.17", "rCourseQuality": "1.35", "rWorkRequired": "1.79", "rInstructorAccess": "1.96", "rReadingsValue": "1.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.60", "rCommAbility": "1.33", "rInstructorQuality": "1.44"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO BIOMECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-200-001", "path": "/courses/2662/sections/001", "id": "2662-001", "aliases": ["BE-200-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 94, "path": "/courses/2662/sections/001/reviews/165-SOLOMON-R-POLLACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/165-SOLOMON-R-POLLACK", "first_name": "SOLOMON R", "last_name": "POLLACK", "id": "165-SOLOMON-R-POLLACK", "name": "SOLOMON R POLLACK"}, "num_reviewers": 48, "id": "2662-001-165-SOLOMON-R-POLLACK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BE-200", "path": "/courses/2662", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2662/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO BIOMECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-200-001", "path": "/courses/2662/sections/001", "id": "2662-001", "aliases": ["BE-200-001"]}]}, "id": 2662, "aliases": ["BE-200"]}
