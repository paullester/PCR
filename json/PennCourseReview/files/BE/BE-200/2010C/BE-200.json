The first portion of the course will present fundamental concepts of force and mechanics of rigid and deformable bodies. The remainder of the course will consist of an introduction of materials science and engineering, including the classification and bulk properties of implantable materials. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "INTRO TO BIOMECHANICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22680/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.10", "rDifficulty": "3.49", "rStimulateInterest": "1.18", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "1.34", "rWorkRequired": "3.10", "rInstructorAccess": "2.23", "rReadingsValue": "1.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.33", "rCommAbility": "1.13", "rInstructorQuality": "1.25"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO BIOMECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BE-200-001", "path": "/courses/22680/sections/001", "id": "22680-001", "aliases": ["BE-200-001"]}, "comments": "This course investigates the application of statics and dynamics to simple force analyses of the musculoskeletal system.

Some students thought that the class \u201ccould have been more interesting.\u201d Many also expressed that they did not learn much from the lectures, and were forced learn the material on their own.\r\n\r\nStudents generally were not pleased with Professor Lampe\u2019s teaching. Professor Lampe \u201cwas not articulate at communicating the course material,\u201d and the information on his lecture slides was taken directly out of the textbook. Students also felt that lectures did not prepare them well enough for homework questions and they \u201cfelt very unprepared for the quizzes.\u201d However, some students did feel that Dr. Lampe was \u201cvery clear and helpful\u201d in his office hours. \r\n\r\nMost of the students who took this class were Bioengineering majors. They felt that the course was challenging, as they were pressured to master the material because \u201cso much\u2026was covered in\u2026a short amount of time.\u201d In fact, many students shared the opinion that \u201cthe sheer amount of content covered in this class was unreasonable.\u201d The exams given in this course were difficult and lengthy.\r\n", "num_students": 98, "path": "/courses/22680/sections/001/reviews/5588-JOSHUA-W--LAMPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5588-JOSHUA-W--LAMPE", "first_name": "JOSHUA W.", "last_name": "LAMPE", "id": "5588-JOSHUA-W--LAMPE", "name": "JOSHUA W.
