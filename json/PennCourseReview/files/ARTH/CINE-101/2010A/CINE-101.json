{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3315"}, "description": "This course surveys the history of world film from cinema s precursors to 1945. We will develop methods for analyzing film while examining the growth of film as an art, an industry, and a political instrument. The course begins with the emergence of film technology and early film audiences. We will then look at the rise of narrative film and the birth of Hollywood before turning to a number of national film industries that flourished after World War I, including French, Italian, Soviet, German, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian film. Along the way, we will look at different genres and topics including African-American independent film during the silent era, animation, ethnographic and documentary film, censorship, and the coming of sound. We conclude with the transformation of several film industries into propaganda tools during World War II (including the Nazi, Soviet, and US film industries). There are no prerequisites. Requirements include a short essay, a research project, a midterm, and a final. Fulfills the Arts and Letters Sector (All Classes). \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25782/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "2.97", "rRecommendMajor": "3.72", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.16", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.39", "rInstructorQuality": "3.26"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CINE-101-401", "path": "/courses/25782/sections/401", "id": "25782-401", "aliases": ["CINE-101-401", "ENGL-091-401", "ARTH-108-401"]}, "comments": "This course is an introduction to the history of cinema from 1895 to the present. In demonstrating how history energizes and complicates the movies, it examines numerous film cultures and historical periods, including Hollywood silent cinema, Italian neo-realism, the French New Wave, recent films from Iran, and a variety of other film movements from different historical epochs and cultures. Screenings will feature movies such as Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin (1925), Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion (1937), Nicholas Ray's Rebel without a Cause (1955), Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt (1963, Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing (1989), and Sally Potter's Orlando (1992). The aim of the course is to establish a broad historical and global foundation for the understanding of film as a complex exchange between art, technology, politics, and economics. \r\n\r\nMost students remarked that the class was overall enjoyable and interesting; however, some remarked that the lectures became too \u201cdry\u201d after a while. Students blamed this on the large class size, and the inability of Professor Mazaj to make the class feel smaller. Overall, though, students reported enjoying the course material. One student reported that \u201cI have never once been bored in class.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Mazaj is universally hailed as \u201cabsolutely amazing.\u201d Many said she was the perfect person to introduce them to cinema. According to some, \u201cshe managed to make silent films interesting.\u201d Professor Mazaj has \u201ca great way of communicating points to her students.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students claimed that there was a lot of reading involved in the course, because of the numerous Blackboard readings and the weekly film that students have to watch. Many said that \u201cthe reading isn\u2019t hard but sometimes there was a lot assigned.\u201d Some said that the grades did not reflect the material learned. The class fulfills the Arts and Letters requirement, and many said it was even a good class for non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/25782/sections/401/reviews/3224-META-MAZAJ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3224-META-MAZAJ", "first_name": "META", "last_name": "MAZAJ", "id": "3224-META-MAZAJ", "name": "META MAZAJ"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "25782-401-3224-META-MAZAJ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-101", "path": "/courses/25782", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25782/sections", "values": [{"name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CINE-101-401", "path": "/courses/25782/sections/401", "id": "25782-401", "aliases": ["CINE-101-401", "ENGL-091-401", "ARTH-108-401"]}]}, "id": 25782, "aliases": ["CINE-101", "ENGL-091", "ARTH-108"]}
