In demonstrating how history energizes and complicates the movies, it examines numerous film cultures and historical periods, including Hollywood silent cinema, Italian neo-realism, the French New Wave, recent films from Iran, and a variety of other film movements from different historical epochs and cultures. Screenings will feature movies such as Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin (1925), Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion (1937), Nicholas Ray's Rebel without a Cause (1955), Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt (1963, Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing (1989), and Sally Potter's Orlando (1992). The aim of the course is to establish a broad historical and global foundation for the understanding of film as a complex exchange between art, technology, politics, and economics. \r\n\r\nMost students remarked that the class was overall enjoyable and interesting; however, some remarked that the lectures became too \u201cdry\u201d after a while.
