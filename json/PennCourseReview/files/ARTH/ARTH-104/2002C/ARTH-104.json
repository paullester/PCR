{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1665"}, "description": "This course is a survey of sculpture, painting and architecture in the Indian sub-continent from 2300 B.C., touching on the present. It attempts to explore the role of tradition in the broader history of art in India, but not to see India as 'traditional' or unchanging. The Indian sub-continent is the source for multi-cultural civilizations that have lasted and evolved for several thousand years. Its art is as rich and complex as that of Europe, as diverse. This course attempts to introduce the full range of artistic production in India in relation to the multiple strands that have made the cultural fabric of the sub-continent so rich and long lasting. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "ART OF ASIA:INDIA,S.EAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2636/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.19", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.69", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.94", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ART OF ASIA:INDIA,S.EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARTH-104-401", "path": "/courses/2636/sections/401", "id": "2636-401", "aliases": ["ARTH-104-401", "SARS-201-401", "SARS-501-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/2636/sections/401/reviews/144-MICHAEL-W-MEISTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/144-MICHAEL-W-MEISTER", "first_name": "MICHAEL W", "last_name": "MEISTER", "id": "144-MICHAEL-W-MEISTER", "name": "MICHAEL W MEISTER"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "2636-401-144-MICHAEL-W-MEISTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-104", "path": "/courses/2636", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2636/sections", "values": [{"name": "ART OF ASIA:INDIA,S.EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARTH-104-401", "path": "/courses/2636/sections/401", "id": "2636-401", "aliases": ["ARTH-104-401", "SARS-201-401", "SARS-501-401"]}]}, "id": 2636, "aliases": ["ARTH-104", "SARS-201", "SARS-501"]}
