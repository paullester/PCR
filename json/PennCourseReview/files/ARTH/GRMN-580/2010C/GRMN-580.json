Ekphrasis - the verbal representation of visual art - continues to be a central concern of work and image studies today. The understanding of ekphrasis as an often hostile paragone (competition) between word and image exists alongside notions of a more reciprocal model involving a dialogue or \"encounter\" between visual and verbal cultures. The affective dimension of the relationship -- ekphratic hope, ekphratic fear -- has also been prominent in recent scholarship. Drawing on literary works and theories from a range of historical periods and national traditions, the course will examine the aesthetic and ideological implications of ekphrasis. Why are certain literary genres such as the novel privileged sites for ekphrasis? How can art history inform our understanding of such encounters? What can we learn from current work on intermediality and translation? \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "Walter Benjamin: Art, Philosophy, Literature", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23169/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.32", "rDifficulty": "2.68", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.35", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.32", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "Walter Benjamin: Art, Philosophy, Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-580-401", "path": "/courses/23169/sections/401", "id": "23169-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-580-401", "ENGL-592-401", "PHIL-554-401", "COML-582-401", "ARTH-560-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/23169/sections/401/reviews/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "first_name": "LILIANE", "last_name": "WEISSBERG", "id": "1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "name": "LILIANE WEISSBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "23169-401-1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-580", "path": "/courses/23169", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23169/sections", "values": [{"name": "Walter Benjamin: Art, Philosophy, Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-580-401", "path": "/courses/23169/sections/401", "id": "23169-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-580-401", "ENGL-592-401", "PHIL-554-401", "COML-582-401", "ARTH-560-401"]}]}, "id": 23169, "aliases": ["GRMN-580", "ENGL-592", "PHIL-554", "COML-582", "ARTH-560"]}
