It emphasizes Impressionism's critical reception and the historical conditions allowing France to claim the emergence of early Modernism. The class focuses on considering how an art of vision and light figures the complexities of history and politics and especially the revolutions that marked the period; the gendered and sexual politics of Impressionism's obsession with the nude female body; and, how the invention of the new technologies and media effected the development of modern art. Throughout the course, students will also analyze the effects the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris had on artistic developments. &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nThis class is a \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cvery interesting\u201d course that \u201ccovers the subject matter in great detail.\u201d Students collectively felt that they \u201cgained a very good understanding of the time period\u201d and appreciated that this discipline was made \u201cvery accessible to those who had never studied it before.\u201d &#8232;\r\n\r\nProfessor Dombrowski \u201cis interesting to listen to\u201d and is \u201cable to create interest and satisfy expectations created.\u201d While one student believed that Professor Dombrowski \u201cneeds to work on his time management,\u201d other students described him as both a \u201cvery engaging professor\u201d and a \u201cdynamic leader.\u201d Because the professor \u201cinjects enthusiasm into the classes,\u201d \u201cit is impossible to tune out during his class.\u201d Students generally felt the class educated them sufficiently on the material, in part due to Professor Dombrowski\u2019s obvious \u201cpassion for the subject matter.\u201d Lectures are structured \u201cby concept, not time period,\u201d so while Professor Dombrowski analyzes the same paintings throughout the course, he interprets them differently based on the new concept, making \u201cevery lesson\u2026exciting and fresh.\u201d With especially \u201cstimulating lectures,\u201d one student asserted that, \u201cthe class made me question my whole major because [Professor Dombrowski] stimulated my interest in Art History so much. If I remember one class and one professor from Penn, it will be this class. 10 STARS.\u201d &#8232;\r\n\r\n&#8232;This class involves a significant amount of reading and a \u201cfair amount of work,\u201d making it \u201cdifficult and worthwhile.\u201d Students typically found that \u201crecitations stimulate thought-provoking discussions,\u201d but others felt \u201creadings were at times tedious and unrewarding.\u201d Others felt the readings were \u201cvery well selected\u201d but mentioned they might \u201cprefer TAs that have already taken the course.\u201d Additionally, this elective\u2019s final exam and paper over the course of the same week seemed \u201credundant.\u201d Some expressed that there was some \u201crepetitiveness in assignments/tests throughout the course,\u201d however, one student summarizes the class\u2019 overall sentiment by saying \u201cthe class was well taught, the readings were relevant, and the assignments were appropriate to encourage learning.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/22662/sections/401/reviews/4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI", "first_name": "ANDRE", "last_name": "DOMBROWSKI", "id": "4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI", "name": "ANDRE DOMBROWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 57, "id": "22662-401-4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI"}]
