The class considers French, Dutch, and Scandanavian artists who painted and exhibited in Paris during these years, exploring not only their historical stature and reputation, but their contemporary relevance. It will reflect on such myths of modernism as the \"misogyny\"of Degas; the \"obsessiveness\" of Cezanne; the \"primitivism\" of Gauguin; and, of course, the \"madness\" of Van Gogh. All art is considered within the context of the social, economic and political changes that were taking place in Paris--the capital of the nineteenth--century.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents generally enjoyed the \u201chighly engaging\u201d course. They appreciated that they \u201cdiscussed so much more than arts in this class.\u201d Other topics, which included prostitution, photography, physiognomy and more, were \u201cfascinating in their own right and even more interesting when connected by the professor to the art of the Impressionists.\u201d The course exposed students to \u201ca variety of themes and methodologies.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents commented that Professor Dombrowski\u2019s way of teaching was both \u201csmart and fascinating.\u201d Students appreciated that he asked \u201cquestions that were tough, well-considered, and provocative, while creating a learning-friendly and compassionate atmosphere in the classroom.\u201d Professor Dombrowski\u2019s ability to artfully summarize large amounts of complex historical and theoretical intro was \u201cnothing less than astounding.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nDespite the fascinating course design and the professor, some students complained that too much work was required for this course. Notwithstanding the vast amount of work, which included long readings and many papers, however, students recommended this course to anyone interested in the subject.\r\n", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/16975/sections/401/reviews/4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI", "first_name": "ANDRE", "last_name": "DOMBROWSKI", "id": "4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI", "name": "ANDRE DOMBROWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 56, "id": "16975-401-4746-ANDRE-DOMBROWSKI"}]
