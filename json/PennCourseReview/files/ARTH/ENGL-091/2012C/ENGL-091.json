{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1812"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to the history of cinema from the 1890s to the present. In demonstrating how history energizes and complicates the movies, we will examine numerous film cultures and historical periods, including Hollywood silent cinema, Italian neo-realism, the French New Wave, recent films from Iran, and a variety of other film movements from different historical epochs and cultures. Screenings will feature movies such as Sergei Eisenstein's THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (1925), Jean Renoir's THE GRAND ILLUSION (1937), Nicholas Ray's REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955), Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963), Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING (1989), Sally Potter's ORLANDO (1992), and Pedro Almodovar's TALK TO HER (2003). Our aim is to establish a broad historical and global foundation for the understanding of film as a complex exchange between art, technology, politics, and economics. Screenings will be mandatory. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945: Film History and Analysis to 1945", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28838/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.04", "rTAQuality": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.42", "rWorkRequired": "2.11", "rInstructorQuality": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945: Film History and Analysis to 1945", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-091-401", "path": "/courses/28838/sections/401", "id": "28838-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-091-401", "ARTH-108-401", "COML-123-401", "CINE-101-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 70, "path": "/courses/28838/sections/401/reviews/2467-PETER-DECHERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2467-PETER-DECHERNEY", "first_name": "PETER", "last_name": "DECHERNEY", "id": "2467-PETER-DECHERNEY", "name": "PETER DECHERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 66, "id": "28838-401-2467-PETER-DECHERNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-091", "path": "/courses/28838", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28838/sections", "values": [{"name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945: Film History and Analysis to 1945", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-091-401", "path": "/courses/28838/sections/401", "id": "28838-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-091-401", "ARTH-108-401", "COML-123-401", "CINE-101-401"]}]}, "id": 28838, "aliases": ["ENGL-091", "ARTH-108", "COML-123", "CINE-101"]}
