{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1812"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to the history of cinema from the 1890s to the present. In demonstrating how history energizes and complicates the movies, we will examine numerous film cultures and historical periods, including Hollywood silent cinema, Italian neo-realism, the French New Wave, recent films from Iran, and a variety of other film movements from different historical epochs and cultures. Screenings will feature movies such as Sergei Eisenstein's THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (1925), Jean Renoir's THE GRAND ILLUSION (1937), Nicholas Ray's REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955), Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963), Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING (1989), Sally Potter's ORLANDO (1992), and Pedro Almodovar's TALK TO HER (2003). Our aim is to establish a broad historical and global foundation for the understanding of film as a complex exchange between art, technology, politics, and economics. Screenings will be mandatory. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22966/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "1.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.51", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "2.98", "rInstructorQuality": "2.90"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD FILM HIST TO 1945", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-091-401", "path": "/courses/22966/sections/401", "id": "22966-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-091-401", "ARTH-108-401", "CINE-101-401"]}, "comments": "World Film history to 1945 surveys the history of world film from cinema\u2019s precursors to 1945. It develops methods for analyzing film while examining the growth of film as an art, an industry, and a political instrument, beginning with the emergence of film technology and early film audiences. Students then explore the rise of narrative film and the birth of Hollywood before turning to a number of national film industries that flourished after World War I, including French, Italian, Soviet, German, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian film. Along the way, the class looks at different genres and topics including African-American independent film during the silent era, animation, ethnographic and documentary film, censorship, and the coming of sound. The course also covers the transformation of several film industries into propaganda tools during World War II (including the Nazi, Soviet, and US film industries). &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents generally consider this course \u201cexcellent\u201d and a \u201cgreat class overall.\u201d While some felt it was \u201cdifficult to get invested in the subject matter,\u201d others believed that \u201cthe subject matter was very interesting.\u201d A few students expressed a desire for \u201cmore required film viewings,\u201d but others anticipate taking future Cinema classes due to their experiences in this one. &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nProfessor Decherney did an \u201cexcellent job of making the material interesting and explaining how early cinema differs (and why) from modern cinema.\u201d Some students observed that he \u201cspoke too fast and didn't speak loudly or clearly enough.\u201d He periodically \u201cgave the impression of not being very prepared, constantly consulting notes instead of just talking to the class.\u201d Professor Decherney\u2019s incorporation of \u201cclips, guest speakers, powerpoints, and class discussion [made] the film history course very rewarding.\u201d Students generally felt he was \u201capproachable and engaging.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nThis class fulfills Sector 2: Language, Literature and Culture and Sector 6: 20th Century Literature of the English Standard Major as well as the Arts and Letter Sector.
