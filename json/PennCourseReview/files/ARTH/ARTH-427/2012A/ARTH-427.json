{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4516"}, "description": "Survey of the Republican origins and Imperial development of Roman sculpture - free-standing, relief, and architectural - from ca. 150 BC to 350 AD. We concentrate on sculpture in the capital city and on court and state arts, emphasizing commemorative public sculpture and Roman habits of decorative display; genres examined include relief, portraits, sarcophagi, luxury and minor arts(gems, metalwork, coinage). We evaluate the choice and evolution of styles with reference to the functions of sculptural representation in Roman culture and society. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ROMAN SCULPTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26990/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ROMAN SCULPTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARTH-427-401", "path": "/courses/26990/sections/401", "id": "26990-401", "aliases": ["ARTH-427-401", "CLST-427-401", "AAMW-427-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/26990/sections/401/reviews/1265-ANN-L--KUTTNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1265-ANN-L--KUTTNER", "first_name": "ANN L.", "last_name": "KUTTNER", "id": "1265-ANN-L--KUTTNER", "name": "ANN L.
