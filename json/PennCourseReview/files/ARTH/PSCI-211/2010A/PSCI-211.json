By careful consideration of recent scholarly research on Middle Eastern politics students will gain an appreciation for the special challenges, opportunities, and responsibilities associated with systematic analysis of politics in a comparative setting.\r\nStudents who took the class agreed that Professor Vitalis generally followed the syllabus and course description.\r\n\r\nReviews were mixed regarding the lecture style. Some students described the discussion-heavy format as engaging and conducive to Professor Vitalis\u2019 \u201cunique\u201d style. Others found that the \u201cattempt to run a medium-sized lecture as a seminar was at times very frustrating,\u201d leading to a class that could feel \u201cunstructured.\u201d A number of students were very impressed with Professor Vitalis, noting that he \u201cdoes an excellent job of communicating important and complex subject matter,\u201d and that he is \u201clively and entertaining.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 main criticisms pertained to the assignments, with many finding the critical book reviews difficult and strictly graded, considering the class \u201cfocused little on how exactly to write a book review.\u201d On the other hand, some felt that the assignments were very helpful in improving critical writing skills. A few students noted that this class is so worthwhile that it should be considered \u201ca must\u201d for political science majors interested in the Middle East.\r\n", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/26661/sections/001/reviews/1014-ROBERT-VITALIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1014-ROBERT-VITALIS", "first_name": "ROBERT", "last_name": "VITALIS", "id": "1014-ROBERT-VITALIS", "name": "ROBERT VITALIS"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "26661-001-1014-ROBERT-VITALIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-211", "path": "/courses/26661", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26661/sections", "values": [{"name": "POL IN CONTEMP MID EAST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-211-001", "path": "/courses/26661/sections/001", "id": "26661-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-211-001"]}]}, "id": 26661, "aliases": ["PSCI-211"]}
