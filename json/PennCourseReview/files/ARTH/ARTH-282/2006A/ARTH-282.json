{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/160"}, "description": "The architecture of Europe and America from the late nineteenth century until the present is the central subject of this course, but some time will also be devoted to Latin American and Asian architecture and to the important issues of modern city planning. Topics to be discussed include the Arts and Crafts movement, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Art Deco, the International Style, and Post-modernism. The debate over the role of technology in modern life and art, the search for a universal language of architectural communication, and the insistent demand that architecture serve human society are themes that will be traced throughout the course. Among the important figures to be considered are Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Rovert Venturi, and Denise Scott Brown. The course includes weekly discussion sessions and several excursions to view architecture in Philadelphia. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "MODERN ARCHITECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7341/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "3.48", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.52", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.15", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.76"}, "section": {"name": "MODERN ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-282-001", "path": "/courses/7341/sections/001", "id": "7341-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-282-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/7341/sections/001/reviews/1271-DAVID-B-BROWNLEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1271-DAVID-B-BROWNLEE", "first_name": "DAVID B", "last_name": "BROWNLEE", "id": "1271-DAVID-B-BROWNLEE", "name": "DAVID B BROWNLEE"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "7341-001-1271-DAVID-B-BROWNLEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-282", "path": "/courses/7341", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7341/sections", "values": [{"name": "MODERN ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-282-001", "path": "/courses/7341/sections/001", "id": "7341-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-282-001"]}]}, "id": 7341, "aliases": ["ARTH-282"]}
