{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4908"}, "description": "This course offers students an introduction to the major texts in film theory across the 20th and 21st centuries. The course gives students an opportunity to read these central texts closely, to understand the range of historical contexts in which film theories are developed, to explore the relationship between film theory and the major film movements, to grapple with the points of contention that have emerged among theorists, and finally to consider: what is the status of film theory today? This course is required for all Cinema Studies majors, but is open to all students, and no prior knowledge of film theory is assumed. Requirements: Close reading of all assigned texts; attendance and participation in section discussions; 1 midterm exam; 1 take-home final exam. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO TO FILM THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30035/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.24", "rTAQuality": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.26", "rCourseQuality": "2.98", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.35"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO FILM THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CINE-103-401", "path": "/courses/30035/sections/401", "id": "30035-401", "aliases": ["CINE-103-401", "COML-116-401", "ENGL-095-401", "ARTH-107-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/30035/sections/401/reviews/3224-META-MAZAJ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3224-META-MAZAJ", "first_name": "META", "last_name": "MAZAJ", "id": "3224-META-MAZAJ", "name": "META MAZAJ"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "30035-401-3224-META-MAZAJ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-103", "path": "/courses/30035", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30035/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO FILM THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CINE-103-401", "path": "/courses/30035/sections/401", "id": "30035-401", "aliases": ["CINE-103-401", "COML-116-401", "ENGL-095-401", "ARTH-107-401"]}]}, "id": 30035, "aliases": ["CINE-103", "COML-116", "ENGL-095", "ARTH-107"]}
