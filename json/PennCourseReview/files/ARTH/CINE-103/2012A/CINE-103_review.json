The course gives students an opportunity to read these central texts closely, to understand the range of historical contexts in which film theories are developed, to explore the relationship between film theory and the major film movements, to grapple with the points of contention that have emerged among theorists, and finally to consider: what is the status of film theory today?  This course is required for all Cinema Studies majors, but is open to all students, and no prior knowledge of film theory is assumed.  Requirements: Close reading of all assigned texts; attendance and participation in section discussions; 1 midterm exam; 1 take-home final exam.\r\n\r\n\tStudents loved this \u201cgreat course,\u201d with many remarking how much they learned about cinema after taking it. Students described the content as \u201cincredibly intellectually stimulating\u201d and \u201cvery interesting,\u201d and loved how the \u201csubjects of philosophy, sociology and psychology\u201d were all connected to cinema. One student called the course \u201cessential to understanding culture,\u201d and students felt they learned a lot from the sometimes \u201cheady\u201d readings. While one student said the material was \u201ctoo dense,\u201d most found the information and theories valuable and interesting.\r\n\r\n\tProfessor Mazaj received glowing reviews from students, who described her as \u201cencouraging, brilliant, witty, and concise.\u201d Students loved her \u201cvery organized\u201d lecturing style and said she \u201cwas great at leading discussions.\u201d Many students called her \u201cthe best professor I have had at Penn,\u201d and praised her ability to \u201cbreak down the topics for the class.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tThough \u201csome of the sources were dense and hard to get through,\u201d students felt the content and professor made it easy to get through the course material. Midterms and the take home final were said to be \u201cof fair difficulty,\u201d and students felt the only drawback was limited participation on the part of certain students. Most of the students taking this class were Cinema Studies majors or minors, but the course was recommended to anyone interested in film theory, as well as an effective way to gain \u201cexposure to a variety of intellectual discourses and inspire new ways of reading and thinking.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/27134/sections/401/reviews/3224-META-MAZAJ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3224-META-MAZAJ", "first_name": "META", "last_name": "MAZAJ", "id": "3224-META-MAZAJ", "name": "META MAZAJ"}, "num_reviewers": 55, "id": "27134-401-3224-META-MAZAJ"}]
