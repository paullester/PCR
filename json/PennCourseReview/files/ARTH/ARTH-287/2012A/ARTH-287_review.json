Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be, employs a range of new materials and technologies, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the \"canon\" of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe, but is becoming increasingly global. The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists of the post-war period, with emphasis on social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant.\r\n\r\nStudents came away from this course on contemporary art with a sense of satisfaction.  Most participants noted that they had developed a much firmer grasp of both the theory and history of contemporary through the course.  While the course was generally effective, students also noted that the course was at times \u201cdifficult to follow\u201d and generally \u201cabove the level\u201d of the class members.\r\n\r\nStudents praised Professor Silverman\u2019s \u201cvast knowledge\u201d and \u201cengaging manner.\u201d  The sole criticism of her teaching style was that she occasionally presented the subject matter with such expertise that it became inaccessible to students.  One student commented that she \u201csometimes assumed students possessed prior knowledge that they did not.\u201d  Nonetheless, Professor Silverman\u2019s \u201capproachability\u201d partly counteracted her occasional misestimations of the appropriate level.\r\n\r\nStudents, who were almost exclusively members of majors that pertained to art, did not find the course unusually difficult.  Neither the workload nor the assessments were considered problematic.  Students maintained that this was among the best art history courses they had ever taken, and strongly recommended it to others.", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/26986/sections/001/reviews/5288-KAJA-SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5288-KAJA-SILVERMAN", "first_name": "KAJA", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "5288-KAJA-SILVERMAN", "name": "KAJA SILVERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 52, "id": "26986-001-5288-KAJA-SILVERMAN"}]
