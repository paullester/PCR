{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2226"}, "description": "This course surveys the arts of Byzantium from the fall of Rome to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Study of major monuments, including icons, mosaics, architecture, and ivories will provide us with an overview of this rich artistic culture. We will pay special attention to the role of the Orthodox Church and liturgy in the production and reception of art works. Weekly recitation sections will focus on selected major issues, such as the relationship of art to the Holy, the uses and abuses of Iconoclasm, and imperial patronage. The course will also grapple with the Empire's relationship to other cultures by looking at the impact of the Christian Crusades and Moslem invasions - as well as Byzantium's crucial impact on European art (e.g., in Sicily, Spain). \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3790/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.86", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.57", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-241-601", "path": "/courses/3790/sections/601", "id": "3790-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-241-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/3790/sections/601/reviews/1262-HEATHER-GROSSMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1262-HEATHER-GROSSMAN", "first_name": "HEATHER", "last_name": "GROSSMAN", "id": "1262-HEATHER-GROSSMAN", "name": "HEATHER GROSSMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "3790-601-1262-HEATHER-GROSSMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-241", "path": "/courses/3790", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3790/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-241-601", "path": "/courses/3790/sections/601", "id": "3790-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-241-601"]}]}, "id": 3790, "aliases": ["ARTH-241"]}
