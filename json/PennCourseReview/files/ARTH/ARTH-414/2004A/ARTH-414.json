{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2742"}, "description": "Three great directors of the \"golden age\" of Japanese cinema, Mizoguchi, Ozu, and Kurosawa, acknowledge their debt to and utilization of traditional visual culture. How they transform those \"frames of tradition\" as they also manipulate the firm medium for particular visual effects will be central in our discussion of several films by each director. We will also consider how these directors had an impact on international cinema and upon other Japanese directors, such as Miyazaki, Kitano and Itami in the 1980s and 1990s. Background in Japanese studies or film studies highly recommended. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "Post-War Japanese Cinema and Visual Culture", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6194/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "Post-War Japanese Cinema and Visual Culture", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-414-001", "path": "/courses/6194/sections/001", "id": "6194-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-414-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/6194/sections/001/reviews/1267-JULIE-NELSON-DAVIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1267-JULIE-NELSON-DAVIS", "first_name": "JULIE NELSON", "last_name": "DAVIS", "id": "1267-JULIE-NELSON-DAVIS", "name": "JULIE NELSON DAVIS"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "6194-001-1267-JULIE-NELSON-DAVIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-414", "path": "/courses/6194", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6194/sections", "values": [{"name": "Post-War Japanese Cinema and Visual Culture", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-414-001", "path": "/courses/6194/sections/001", "id": "6194-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-414-001"]}]}, "id": 6194, "aliases": ["ARTH-414"]}
