{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1221"}, "description": "This survey of modern utilitarian and decorative objects spans the century, fromt he Arts and Crafts Movement to the present, from the rise of Modernism to its rejection in Post-Modernism, from Tiffany glass and tubular-metal furniture to the Sony Walkman. Its overall approach focuses on the aesthetics of designed objects and on the designers who created them, but the course also investigates such related topics as industrialization, technology, ergonomics, and environmental, postindustrial, and universal design. Among the major international figures whose graphics, textiles, furniture, and other products will be studied are William Morris, Frank Lloyd Wright, Josef Hoffmann, Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand, Mies van der Rohe, Alvar Aalto, Raymond Loewy, Charles and Ray Eames, Isamu Noguchi, Eero Saarinen, Paul Rand, Jack Lenor Larsen, Ettore Sottsass,Jr., Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry, and Philippe Starck. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "MASTERS OF MODERN DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1328/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.84", "rDifficulty": "2.04", "rStimulateInterest": "2.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.16", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.16", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.72", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "2.52", "rInstructorQuality": "2.72"}, "section": {"name": "MASTERS OF MODERN DESIGN", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-288-601", "path": "/courses/1328/sections/601", "id": "1328-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-288-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/1328/sections/601/reviews/1273-GEORGE-H--MARCUS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1273-GEORGE-H--MARCUS", "first_name": "GEORGE H.", "last_name": "MARCUS", "id": "1273-GEORGE-H--MARCUS", "name": "GEORGE H.
