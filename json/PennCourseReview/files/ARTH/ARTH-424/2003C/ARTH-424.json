{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2231"}, "description": "Painted vases constitute the most important and comprehensive collection of visual evidence that survives from ancient Greece. In this course, we will examine the development of Greek vase-painting from the 10th to the 4th century BC, with particular emphasis on the pottery of the archaic and Classical periods of produced in the cities of Athens and Corinth. We will look at the vases as objects--and the extensive collection of Greek vases in the University of Pennsylvania Museum will be an important resource for this course--but we will also consider them as they relate to broader cultural issues. Some background in art history or classical studies is helpful but not required. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "GREEK VASE PAINTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3800/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-424", "path": "/courses/3800", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3800/sections", "values": [{"name": "GREEK VASE PAINTING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-424-001", "path": "/courses/3800/sections/001", "id": "3800-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-424-001"]}]}, "id": 3800, "aliases": ["ARTH-424"]}
