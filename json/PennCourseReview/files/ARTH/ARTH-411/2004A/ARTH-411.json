{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2741"}, "description": "This course is a critical history of the arts and architecture of the Indian sub-continent from the arrival and integration of Islamic religious beliefs and practices and Turko-Persian culture to its renegotiation in the present. The multicultural civilization of the Indian sub-continent had already evolved through several thousand years, and its art became more complex and diverse as a new strand entered and interacted with this pre-existing culture.
