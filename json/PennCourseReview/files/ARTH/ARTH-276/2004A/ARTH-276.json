{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2740"}, "description": "Impressionism opened the pictorial field to light, perception, science, modernity, bourgeoise leisure and famously the material qualities of paint itself. This course will survey the movement's major contexts and proponents--Magnet, Monet, Morisot, Cezanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Rodin--from its origins in the 1860's to its demise in the 1890's, as well as its subsequent adaptions throughout the world until World War I. Particular attention is paid to the artist's critical reception and the historical conditions which allowed one nation, France, to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. The course will also analyze the effects of the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris, and its affects on artistic developments. We will also look outside of France's borders to Germany and Britain. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PAINT IN FRANCE: Painting in France from Poussin to Cezanne", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6188/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.11", "rDifficulty": "3.16", "rStimulateInterest": "2.84", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.16", "rReadingsValue": "2.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.32", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "PAINT IN FRANCE: Painting in France from Poussin to Cezanne", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-276-601", "path": "/courses/6188/sections/601", "id": "6188-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-276-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/6188/sections/601/reviews/143-VICTORIA-GARDNER-COATES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/143-VICTORIA-GARDNER-COATES", "first_name": "VICTORIA GARDNER", "last_name": "COATES", "id": "143-VICTORIA-GARDNER-COATES", "name": "VICTORIA GARDNER COATES"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "6188-601-143-VICTORIA-GARDNER-COATES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-276", "path": "/courses/6188", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6188/sections", "values": [{"name": "PAINT IN FRANCE: Painting in France from Poussin to Cezanne", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-276-601", "path": "/courses/6188/sections/601", "id": "6188-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-276-601"]}]}, "id": 6188, "aliases": ["ARTH-276"]}
