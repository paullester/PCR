It considers great monuments like the Coliseum and Nero's palace, to brothels and peasant huts. It will examine what Romans ate and how died, Roman economic systems, transportation, religion and other aspects of Roman material culture.\r\n\r\nStudents genuinely enjoyed this course.  Nearly all participants noted that they came away from the course with a wealth of knowledge, unfamiliar to them at the start of the course.  Students commented that each course was \u201cthoughtfully planned.\u201d  A few wished the lecture slides had contained more of the information, but almost all found the material \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cwell-communicated.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Bowes was praised as \u201cvery passionate\u201d about the material equally \u201cknowledgeable.\u201d  Students appreciated the careful manner in which she explained the material, and facilitated class discussion.  Several students noted that Professor Bowes was \u201cwilling and eager to discuss the material and address questions\u201d outside the classroom.  \r\n\r\nStudents considered both the workload and assessments \u201creasonable, for anyone who regularly attended class.\u201d  Tests were generally described as easier than take-home assignments, however the grading was fair for both.  Nearly all reviewers had some prior experience in classics or archaeology, but almost all found the material \u201cexciting\u201d nonetheless.  This class was widely recommended.", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/27188/sections/401/reviews/5323-KIMBERLY-D--BOWES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5323-KIMBERLY-D--BOWES", "first_name": "KIMBERLY D.", "last_name": "BOWES", "id": "5323-KIMBERLY-D--BOWES", "name": "KIMBERLY D.
