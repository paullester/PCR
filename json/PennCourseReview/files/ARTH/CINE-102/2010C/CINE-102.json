Beginning with the cinematic revolution signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism (of Rossellini and De Sica), we will follow the evolution of postwar cinema through the French New Wave (of Godard, Resnais, and Varda), American movies of the 1950s and 1960s (including the New Hollywood cinema of Coppola and Scorsese), and the various other new wave movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (such as the New German Cinema). We will then selectively examine some of the most important films of the last two decades, including those of U.S. independent film movement and movies from Iran, China, and elsewhere in an expanding global cinema culture. There will be precise attention paid to formal and stylistic techniques in editing, mise-en-scene, and sound, as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of film. \n\nAt the same time, those formal features will be closely linked to historical and cultural distinctions and changes, ranging from the Paramount Decision of 1948 to the digital convergences that are defining screen culture today. There are no perquisites. Requirements will include readings in film history and film analysis, an analytical essay, a research paper, a final exam, and active participation. Fulfills the Arts and Letters Sector (All Classes). \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "WORLD FILM HIST '45-PRES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22808/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.26", "rDifficulty": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "1.98", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.23", "rCommAbility": "2.28", "rInstructorQuality": "2.22"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD FILM HIST '45-PRES", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CINE-102-601", "path": "/courses/22808/sections/601", "id": "22808-601", "aliases": ["CINE-102-601", "ARTH-109-601", "ENGL-092-601"]}, "comments": "Focusing on movies made after 1945, this course allows students to learn and to sharpen methods, terminologies, and tools needed for the critical analysis of film.
