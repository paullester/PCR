{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2222"}, "description": "Human experience is shaped by the built environment. This course introduces students to the interrelated fields of architecture, art history, and engineering and explores great architectural monuments from the ancient to the modern period, from India across the Mediterranean and Europe to the US. The focus will be on understanding these works in their structure and function, both as products of individual ingenuity and reflections of Zeitgeist. Questioning these monuments from a present-day perspective across the cultures will be an important ingredient, as will be podium discussions, guest lectures, excursions, and all kinds of visualizations, from digital walk-throughs to practical design exercises. \n\nRegularly taught in fall term, this course fulfills Sector IV, Humanities and Social Science, and it satisfies History of Art 100-level course requirements. There is only ONE recitation in this course, attached directly to Friday's class at 2-3 p.m., in order to provide sufficient time for practica and fild trips. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ARCHITECT AND HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18290/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.34", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.32", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.51", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.86", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHITECT AND HISTORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-001-001", "path": "/courses/18290/sections/001", "id": "18290-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-001-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 93, "path": "/courses/18290/sections/001/reviews/127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER", "first_name": "LOTHAR", "last_name": "HASELBERGER", "id": "127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER", "name": "LOTHAR HASELBERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 81, "id": "18290-001-127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-001", "path": "/courses/18290", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18290/sections", "values": [{"name": "ARCHITECT AND HISTORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-001-001", "path": "/courses/18290/sections/001", "id": "18290-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-001-001"]}]}, "id": 18290, "aliases": ["ARTH-001"]}
