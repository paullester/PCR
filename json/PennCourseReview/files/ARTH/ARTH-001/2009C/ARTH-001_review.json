The focus will be on understanding these works in their structure and function, both as products of individual ingenuity and reflections of Zeitgeist. Questioning these monuments from a present-day perspective across the cultures will be an important ingredient, as will be podium discussions, guest lectures, excursions, and all kinds of visualizations, from digital walk-throughs to practical design exercises.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents commented that they loved \u201clearning about a subject that was previously completely foreign to [them].\u201d A student felt that a \u201ctrue academic experience was provided by the class and the professor.\u201d Students also enjoyed the weekly excursions on campus or downtown.
