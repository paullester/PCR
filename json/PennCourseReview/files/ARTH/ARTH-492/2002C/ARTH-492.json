{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1678"}, "description": "Too often photographs are viewed solely as aesthetic images. This course will explore the specifically intentions, functions and interpretations of certain genres of photographs. In the 19th century, photography, participated in anthropology, colonialialism, medicine, pornography, and social reform. The section on the 20th century will focus on photography as a means of revolution (as practiced by dadaists, Futurists, Surrealists and Russian revolutionary artists); photography in the service of the state (fascism, communism, and the New Deal in the U.S.); the new identity politics practiced by a number of contemporary photographers whose works address race, gender and topical crises such as AIDS; and censorship. This course will approach the photograph as a social document, as well as an artistic one. Our goal will be to analyze the ways in which aesthetics and politics intersect. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "IMAGES OF THE AMER.
