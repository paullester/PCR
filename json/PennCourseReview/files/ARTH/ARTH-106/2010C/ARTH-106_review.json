The focus is on understanding these works in their structure and function, both as products of individual ingenuity and reflections of Zeitgeist. Questioning these monuments from a present-day perspective across the cultures is an important ingredient, as are podium discussions, guest lectures, excursions, and all kinds of visualizations, from digital walk-throughs to practical rope-laying experiments. There are no prerequisites for this course. &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nFor the most part, students enjoyed the class, with one student calling it \u201cone of the best classes I\u2019ve taken at Penn.\u201d Students also emphasized the volume of knowledge they gained from this course. However, one student did criticize the course as being \u201crepetitive.\u201d But overall, students appreciated their \u201cimproved ability to conceptualize and analyze architecture.\u201d&#8232; Some students disliked the level of detail in the material, calling it \u201cunnecessary.\u201d One student found Professor Haselberger\u2019s lectures \u201chard to follow because he uses a lot of qualifiers and filler words.\u201d \r\n\r\n&#8232;All of the students in the course heaped praise on Professor Haselberger, calling him \u201centhusiastic,\u201d \u201cpassionate,\u201d \u201cincredible,\u201d \u201cfriendly,\u201d \u201ccaring,\u201d \u201cinspiring\u201d and \u201camazing.\u201d Students commended Professor Haselberger for his command of the material and his \u201celoquent\u201d lectures.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents were divided over the course\u2019s oral exams: some \u201cenjoyed\u201d the exams, while others disliked the testing style but understood the purpose of the exam style. Many students felt concerned about the workload of the course being too much for an introductory class. While the course is required for architecture students and is therefore technically driven, some students wished for more of an introduction to concepts as an aid to non-architect students. Students also had difficulty with class discussion due to the size of the class and felt that discussion would work better in a smaller setting. Students, however, enjoyed the interactive component of the course that involved field trips to buildings in Philadelphia.\r\n", "num_students": 84, "path": "/courses/22654/sections/001/reviews/127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER", "first_name": "LOTHAR", "last_name": "HASELBERGER", "id": "127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER", "name": "LOTHAR HASELBERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 81, "id": "22654-001-127-LOTHAR-HASELBERGER"}]
