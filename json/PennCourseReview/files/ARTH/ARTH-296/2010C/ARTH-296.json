{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3825"}, "description": "This course will survey the most important and interesting art produced in the United States (or by American artists living abroad) up through the 1950s. This period encompasses the history of both early and modern art in the U.S., from its first appearances to its rise to prominence and institutionalization. While tracking this history, the course will examine art's relation to historical processes of modernization (industrialization, the development of transportation and communications, the spread of corporate organization in business, urbanization, technological development, the rise of mass media and mass markets, etc.) and to the economic polarization, social fragmentation, political conflict, and myriad cultural changes these developments entailed. In these circumstances, art is drawn simultaneously toward truth and fraud, realism and artifice, science and spirituality, commodification and ephemerality, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, individualism and collectivity, the past and the future, professionalization and popularity, celebrating modern life and criticizing it. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "AMERICAN ART: 1865-1968", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22664/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.82", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.32", "rReadingsValue": "3.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.68", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.14"}, "section": {"name": "AMERICAN ART: 1865-1968", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-296-601", "path": "/courses/22664/sections/601", "id": "22664-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-296-601"]}, "comments": "This course surveys the history of modern art in the U.S., from its international prominence during the 1950s to its alleged replacement by \"postmodernism.\" It explores the relation of art to historical processes of modernization (industrialization, urbanization, technological development, the rise of mass media and mass markets, etc.) and to the economic polarization, social fragmentation, political conflict, and myriad cultural changes these developments entailed.
