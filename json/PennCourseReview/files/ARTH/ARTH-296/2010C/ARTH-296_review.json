Students described this class as \u201cenjoyable\u201d and \u201ccompelling.\u201d Overall, students were pleased with the course, as one wrote, \u201cLectures were organized and clear. Reading assignments, though numerous, complimented the material in lectures quite well.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;Students were extremely happy with Professor Butterfield, one student calling her \u201cthe best Art History professor I have had.\u201d She was good at clearly presenting material in lecture, though students were frustrated with the vague directions given for the final group presentation.&#8232;&#8232;This class includes group projects, an object paper, and a \u201cheavy\u201d amount of reading (with response papers).
