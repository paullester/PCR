{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/158"}, "description": "This course is designed to give the student an overview of the cultures of the Aegean Bronze Age. The art and architecture of Crete, the Cyclades and the Mainland of Greece will be examined in chronological order, with an emphasis on materials and techniques. In addition, larger issues such as the development of social complexity and stratification, and the changing balance of power during the Aegean Bronze Age will be examined. There are two texts for the course: Sinclair Hood's The Arts in Prehistoric Greece and Donald Preziosi and Louise Hitchcock's Aegean Art and the Architecture. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "MIN, CYC & MYCENAEAN ART", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1323/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "MIN, CYC & MYCENAEAN ART", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-222-001", "path": "/courses/1323/sections/001", "id": "1323-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-222-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/1323/sections/001/reviews/130-ELIZABETH-SHANK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/130-ELIZABETH-SHANK", "first_name": "ELIZABETH", "last_name": "SHANK", "id": "130-ELIZABETH-SHANK", "name": "ELIZABETH SHANK"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "1323-001-130-ELIZABETH-SHANK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-222", "path": "/courses/1323", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1323/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIN, CYC & MYCENAEAN ART", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-222-001", "path": "/courses/1323/sections/001", "id": "1323-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-222-001"]}]}, "id": 1323, "aliases": ["ARTH-222"]}
