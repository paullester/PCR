{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2386"}, "description": "In this course, we will examine the impact of historical context, leadership, constitutionalism, political parties, civil society, economic reform, regime legitimacy, and the international community of the democratic transition process in sub-Saharan Africa. Specific country case studies will be examined both comparatively and regionally, given the increasingly interdependent nature of political and economic transition on the continent. The goal of the seminar is to provide students with the tools necessary to understand the democratic transition process in Africa in a way that is also relevant to other regions in the world. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5798/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.91", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-312-401", "path": "/courses/5798/sections/401", "id": "5798-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-312-401", "AFST-312-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/5798/sections/401/reviews/1007-PAUL-KAISER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1007-PAUL-KAISER", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "KAISER", "id": "1007-PAUL-KAISER", "name": "PAUL KAISER"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "5798-401-1007-PAUL-KAISER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-312", "path": "/courses/5798", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5798/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-312-401", "path": "/courses/5798/sections/401", "id": "5798-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-312-401", "AFST-312-401"]}]}, "id": 5798, "aliases": ["PSCI-312", "AFST-312"]}
