{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3468"}, "description": "This reading- and discussion-intensive seminar will use historical and political analyses, ethnographic studies, novels, and films to consider and compare the experiences of Iraq, Egypt, and Algeria in the modern period. Themes to be covered include the nature of local Arab and Arabic cultures; the impact and legacies of Ottoman and Western imperialism; the development of Islamist, nationalist, and feminist movements; the status of non-Arab or non-Muslim minorities (notably the Iraqi Kurds, Egyptian Copts, and Algerian Berbers); and patterns of social and economic change. The class will culminate in research projects that students individually design and pursue. This class is intended for juniors, seniors, and graduate students. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "IRAQ, EGYPT, ALGERIA: Iraq, Egypt, Algeria: Case Studies from the Arab World", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9289/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.69", "rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "3.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "3.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.92", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.31", "rCommAbility": "3.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "IRAQ, EGYPT, ALGERIA: Iraq, Egypt, Algeria: Case Studies from the Arab World", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-331-401", "path": "/courses/9289/sections/401", "id": "9289-401", "aliases": ["NELC-331-401", "NELC-531-401", "AFST-331-401", "AFST-531-401"]}, "comments": "Students applaud professor Sharkey\u2019s \u201cwisdom on the topics,\u201d with almost unanimous enjoyment of the course and her teaching style.
