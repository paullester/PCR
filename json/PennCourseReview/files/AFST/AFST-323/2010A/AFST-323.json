{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5294"}, "description": "This course focuses on the cultural and social dimensions of HIV/AIDS and its impact on African communities, that is, both the infected and the affected. It considers the different means these communities are using to combat the scourge despite certain cultural beliefs and practices which sometimes hinder diagnosis and treatment. In addition to exploring how Africans characterize the disease in their own languages, we will examine the role of the mass media, folk media, short stories, songs, popular theatre, etc. in educating people about HIV/AIDS reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of various strategies as reflected in the success rates in some countries but not others. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25566/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.39", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.77", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.74", "rReadingsValue": "3.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.35", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-323-601", "path": "/courses/25566/sections/601", "id": "25566-601", "aliases": ["AFST-323-601", "AFST-523-601", "HSOC-356-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/25566/sections/601/reviews/5967-JOYCE-T-MATHANGWANE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5967-JOYCE-T-MATHANGWANE", "first_name": "JOYCE T", "last_name": "MATHANGWANE", "id": "5967-JOYCE-T-MATHANGWANE", "name": "JOYCE T MATHANGWANE"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "25566-601-5967-JOYCE-T-MATHANGWANE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFST-323", "path": "/courses/25566", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25566/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-323-601", "path": "/courses/25566/sections/601", "id": "25566-601", "aliases": ["AFST-323-601", "AFST-523-601", "HSOC-356-601"]}]}, "id": 25566, "aliases": ["AFST-323", "AFST-523", "HSOC-356"]}
