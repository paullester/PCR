Around each of the major ethnic groups are located the minorities in a centre-periphery fashion. The ethnic minorities lack numerical clout to gain democratic control of national decision-making apparatus. They are therefore agitated for home rule resulting in the creation of new states in the federation. But the relative powerlessness remained. The troubling paradox of the situation is that oil wells which account for 95% of Nigeria's export earnings are located in areas that lack decision-making power.
