{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4148"}, "description": "Sudan was marred by several military conflicts between the state and its citizen not only during colonial rule but even during the periods of national rule before and after its independence in 1956. The current conflict in Darfur is one of many wars that ravaged Sudan prior to the ending of Africa's longest civil war between the government forces and military insurgency in the southern part of the country. This course aims to study the reasons behind these military conflicts, civil wars and ethnic conflicts that characterize the modern history of Sudan. There are many reasons behind these conflicts with variation from conflicts over identity to issues of unequal development and representation, to the hegemony of ethnic politics depicted as nationalistic. The course intends to provide students with political and cultural history of the Sudan along with in depth analysis of the many factors that are shaping today's Sudan. \n\n", "semester": "2008B", "name": "SUDAN CONFLICTS/CIV WARS: UNDERSTANDING SUDAN'S CONFLICTS AND CIVIL WARS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19448/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SUDAN CONFLICTS/CIV WARS: UNDERSTANDING SUDAN'S CONFLICTS AND CIVIL WARS", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "AFST-212-910", "path": "/courses/19448/sections/910", "id": "19448-910", "aliases": ["AFST-212-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/19448/sections/910/reviews/4232-ALI-B--ALI-DINAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4232-ALI-B--ALI-DINAR", "first_name": "ALI B.", "last_name": "ALI-DINAR", "id": "4232-ALI-B--ALI-DINAR", "name": "ALI B.
