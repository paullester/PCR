{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4286"}, "description": "This course examines the history, politics, and significance of foreign aid to Africa since the late 19th century. While we do not typically think about the European colonial period in Africa in terms of 'foreign aid,' that era introduced ideas and institutions which formed the foundations for modern aid policies and practices. So we start there and move forward into more contemporary times. In addition to examining the objectives behind foreign assistance and the intentions of donors and recipients, we will look at some of the consequences (intended or unintended) of various forms of foreign aid to Africa over the past century. While not designed to be a comprehensive history of development theory, of African economics, or of international aid organizations, the course will touch on all of these topics. Previous course work on Africa is strongly advised. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HIST FOREIGN AID IN AFRC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26214/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "1.93", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.96", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.79", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "HIST FOREIGN AID IN AFRC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-372-401", "path": "/courses/26214/sections/401", "id": "26214-401", "aliases": ["HIST-372-401", "AFST-372-401", "AFST-542-401", "HIST-542-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/26214/sections/401/reviews/658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI", "first_name": "LEE V", "last_name": "CASSANELLI", "id": "658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI", "name": "LEE V CASSANELLI"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "26214-401-658-LEE-V-CASSANELLI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-372", "path": "/courses/26214", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26214/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST FOREIGN AID IN AFRC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-372-401", "path": "/courses/26214/sections/401", "id": "26214-401", "aliases": ["HIST-372-401", "AFST-372-401", "AFST-542-401", "HIST-542-401"]}]}, "id": 26214, "aliases": ["HIST-372", "AFST-372", "AFST-542", "HIST-542"]}
