{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4879"}, "description": "Restoring women to African history is a worthy goal, but easier said than done.The course examines scholarship over the past forty years that brings to light previously overlooked contributions African women have made to political struggle, religious change, culture preservation, and economic development from pre-colonial times to present. The course addresses basic questions about changing women's roles and human rights controversies associated with African women within the wider cultural and historical contexts in which their lives are lived. It also raises fundamental questions about sources, methodology, and representation, including the value of African women's oral and written narrative and cinema production as avenues to insider perspectives on African women's lives. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "AFRICAN WOMEN'S LIVES PAST AND PRESENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29808/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "AFRICAN WOMEN'S LIVES PAST AND PRESENT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-221-601", "path": "/courses/29808/sections/601", "id": "29808-601", "aliases": ["AFST-221-601", "GSWS-222-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/29808/sections/601/reviews/2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "first_name": "PAMELA", "last_name": "BLAKELY", "id": "2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "name": "PAMELA BLAKELY"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "29808-601-2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFST-221", "path": "/courses/29808", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29808/sections", "values": [{"name": "AFRICAN WOMEN'S LIVES PAST AND PRESENT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-221-601", "path": "/courses/29808/sections/601", "id": "29808-601", "aliases": ["AFST-221-601", "GSWS-222-601"]}]}, "id": 29808, "aliases": ["AFST-221", "GSWS-222"]}
