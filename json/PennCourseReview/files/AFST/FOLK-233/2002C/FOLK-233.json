How has folklore adapted to the realities of contemporary, urban Africa? This course will investigate the continuation of traditional elements produced in diverse media and circumstances in a modern, largely urban, Africa. Although traditional African culture has been transformed and changed in the face of rapid urbanization and modernity, it continues to provide a means through which people enjoy themselves and comment on a wide range of issues affecting their lives. Issues such as identity, difference, and diversity; tradition and history; modernity and development; wealth and power; politics and political change; and gender relations. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "AFRICAN  FOLKLORE: Tradition and Modernity", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2983/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "AFRICAN  FOLKLORE: Tradition and Modernity", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "FOLK-233-601", "path": "/courses/2983/sections/601", "id": "2983-601", "aliases": ["FOLK-233-601", "AFST-233-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/2983/sections/601/reviews/1439-DAVID-SAMPER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1439-DAVID-SAMPER", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "SAMPER", "id": "1439-DAVID-SAMPER", "name": "DAVID SAMPER"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "2983-601-1439-DAVID-SAMPER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FOLK-233", "path": "/courses/2983", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2983/sections", "values": [{"name": "AFRICAN  FOLKLORE: Tradition and Modernity", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "FOLK-233-601", "path": "/courses/2983/sections/601", "id": "2983-601", "aliases": ["FOLK-233-601", "AFST-233-601"]}]}, "id": 2983, "aliases": ["FOLK-233", "AFST-233"]}
