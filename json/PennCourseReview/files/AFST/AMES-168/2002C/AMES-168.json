{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1612"}, "description": "This class will examine the many roles played by women in ancient Egypt. From goddesses and queens, to wives and mothers, women were a visible presence in ancient Egypt. We will study the lives of famous ancient Egyptian women such as Hatshepsut, Nefertiti and Cleopatra. More independent than many of their contemporaries in neighboring areas, Egyptian women enjoyed greater freedoms in matters of economy and law. By examining the evidence left to us in the literature (including literary texts and non-literary texts such as legal documents, administrative texts and letters), the art, and the archaeological record, we will come away with a better understanding of the position of women in this ancient culture. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "WOMEN IN ANCIENT EGYPT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2537/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "3.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.69", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN IN ANCIENT EGYPT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AMES-168-601", "path": "/courses/2537/sections/601", "id": "2537-601", "aliases": ["AMES-168-601", "AFST-168-601", "WSTD-168-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/2537/sections/601/reviews/34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "first_name": "JENNIFER R.", "last_name": "HOUSER", "id": "34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "name": "JENNIFER R.
