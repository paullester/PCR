{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4503"}, "description": "During the past few years, issues that pertain to the conflict in Darfur-Sudan were brought to attention by diverse constituents from policy makers, human rights activists, and national and international entities, each advocating its own interests. This course will provide in-depth analysis of the Darfur conflict based upon the ideology of the Sudanese government since it ascended to power in 1989, and the role of the regional and international politics that keep the conflict ongoing. The course will also explore the role of local militia, the politics of aid in war-torn areas, and the role of Sudan's neighbors in the Darfur conflict and how this could be related to future ongoing conflicts in Sudan. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "THE DARFUR CONFLICT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16900/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.46", "rCommAbility": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "2.63"}, "section": {"name": "THE DARFUR CONFLICT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-169-601", "path": "/courses/16900/sections/601", "id": "16900-601", "aliases": ["AFST-169-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/16900/sections/601/reviews/4232-ALI-B--ALI-DINAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4232-ALI-B--ALI-DINAR", "first_name": "ALI B.", "last_name": "ALI-DINAR", "id": "4232-ALI-B--ALI-DINAR", "name": "ALI B.
