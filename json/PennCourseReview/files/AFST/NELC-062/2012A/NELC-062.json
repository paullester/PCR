Some students described the class material as interesting, exciting, and enjoyable, while others who were less interested in ancient Egyptian history described it as not particularly engaging.  \r\n\r\nStudents were relatively split regarding Professor Wegner\u2019s lecturing.  Some students enjoyed Professor Wegner\u2019s \u201csense of humor in his lectures, which were very well explained and informative.\u201d  However, several students found the lectures to be somewhat dry and monotonous.  In addition, a handful of students stated that the course materials\u2014especially the PowerPoint slides\u2014were slightly disorganized and would benefit from being updated and shortened.  \r\n\r\nCoursework included multiple exams, which asked for relatively detailed information from the material, and therefore required a significant amount of memorization.  This course satisfies the History and Tradition sector requirement.
