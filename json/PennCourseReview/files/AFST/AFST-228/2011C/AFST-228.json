{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5173"}, "description": "Homer's Iliad and Odyssey from ancient Greece and Song of Roland from medieval France are familiar landmarks in world literature. In contrast, Sunjata Epic of Mali, Mwindo Epic of Congo and more than twenty-five other heroic narrative poems throughout Africa are less known but equally valuable for accessing ancient wisdom, exploits of heroes and heroines, cultural values, knowledge systems, and supernatural realms. An additional benefit of studying African epic is that they are performed today or in living memory, so the cultural, performative, and social contexts are not obscured by centuries. These living traditions give us opportunities to more fully understand bards' roles, interaction of bard and audience, transformation from oral to written representation, and the extension of epic themes into other aspects of social life. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "AFRICAN EPIC: PERF&POWR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23939/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "AFRICAN EPIC: PERF&POWR", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-228-601", "path": "/courses/23939/sections/601", "id": "23939-601", "aliases": ["AFST-228-601", "COML-224-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/23939/sections/601/reviews/2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "first_name": "PAMELA", "last_name": "BLAKELY", "id": "2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "name": "PAMELA BLAKELY"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "23939-601-2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFST-228", "path": "/courses/23939", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23939/sections", "values": [{"name": "AFRICAN EPIC: PERF&POWR", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-228-601", "path": "/courses/23939/sections/601", "id": "23939-601", "aliases": ["AFST-228-601", "COML-224-601"]}]}, "id": 23939, "aliases": ["AFST-228", "COML-224"]}
