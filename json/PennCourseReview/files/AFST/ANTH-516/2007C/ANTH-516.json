{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3278"}, "description": "This is a Public Interest Ethnography workshop (originally created by Peggy Reeves Sanday - Department of Anthropology) that incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to exploring social issues. Open to graduate and advanced undergraduate students, the workshop is a response to Amy Gutmann's call for interdisciplinary cooperation across the University and to the Department of Anthropology's commitment to developing public interest research and practice as a disciplinary theme. Rooted in the rubric of public interest social science, the course focuses on: 1) merging problem solving with theory and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice, racial harmony, equality, and human rights; and 2) engaging in public debate on human issues to make research results accessible to a broader audience. The workshop brings in guest speakers and will incorporate original ethnographic research to merge theory with action. Students are encouraged to apply the framing model to a public interest research and action topic of their choice. This is an academically-based-community-service (ABCS) course that partners directly with Penn's Netter Center Community Partnerships. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "PUBLIC INTEREST WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12865/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-516", "path": "/courses/12865", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12865/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC INTEREST WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-516-401", "path": "/courses/12865/sections/401", "id": "12865-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-516-401", "GSOC-516-401", "URBS-516-401", "AFST-516-401"]}]}, "id": 12865, "aliases": ["ANTH-516", "GSOC-516", "URBS-516", "AFST-516"]}
