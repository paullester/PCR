{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3278"}, "description": "This is a Public Interest Ethnography workshop (originally created by Peggy Reeves Sanday - Department of Anthropology) that incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to exploring social issues. Open to graduate and advanced undergraduate students, the workshop is a response to Amy Gutmann's call for interdisciplinary cooperation across the University and to the Department of Anthropology's commitment to developing public interest research and practice as a disciplinary theme. Rooted in the rubric of public interest social science, the course focuses on: 1) merging problem solving with theory and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice, racial harmony, equality, and human rights; and 2) engaging in public debate on human issues to make research results accessible to a broader audience. The workshop brings in guest speakers and will incorporate original ethnographic research to merge theory with action. Students are encouraged to apply the framing model to a public interest research and action topic of their choice. This is an academically-based-community-service (ABCS) course that partners directly with Penn's Netter Center Community Partnerships. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PUBLIC INTEREST WORKSHOP: Public Interest Ethnography", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22633/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "PUBLIC INTEREST WORKSHOP: Public Interest Ethnography", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-516-401", "path": "/courses/22633/sections/401", "id": "22633-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-516-401", "URBS-516-401", "GSOC-516-401", "AFST-516-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/22633/sections/401/reviews/110-PEGGY-R-SANDAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/110-PEGGY-R-SANDAY", "first_name": "PEGGY R", "last_name": "SANDAY", "id": "110-PEGGY-R-SANDAY", "name": "PEGGY R SANDAY"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "22633-401-110-PEGGY-R-SANDAY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-516", "path": "/courses/22633", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22633/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC INTEREST WORKSHOP: Public Interest Ethnography", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-516-401", "path": "/courses/22633/sections/401", "id": "22633-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-516-401", "URBS-516-401", "GSOC-516-401", "AFST-516-401"]}]}, "id": 22633, "aliases": ["ANTH-516", "URBS-516", "GSOC-516", "AFST-516"]}
