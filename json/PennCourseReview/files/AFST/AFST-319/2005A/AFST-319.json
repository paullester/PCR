{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3588"}, "description": "This seminar focuses on one of the more high-profile but often misunderstood issues in environmental studies, African Studies, and international politics - wildlife conservation in sub-Saharan Africa. While it examines the multiple dimensions of wildlife conservation; ecological, economic, social, cultural, and political; the seminar's primary emphasis is the social science dimensions rather than the technical, natural science aspects of the subject. This is not an accidental choice of focus. Political and social factors are often overlooked in discussions of African wildlife conservation but, as this seminar argues, often have a greater weight than biological or ecological concerns in deciding questions of resource management in Africa. The geographic focus of this course will be on East Africa, especially Tanzania and Southern Africa. Though the seminar focuses on the continent of Africa and the specific natural resource of wildlife, its larger theoretical lessons should be applicable to other places and other environmental issues. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "AFRICAN WILDLIFE CONSERV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9921/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "3.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.31", "rCommAbility": "3.23", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "AFRICAN WILDLIFE CONSERV", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-319-601", "path": "/courses/9921/sections/601", "id": "9921-601", "aliases": ["AFST-319-601", "AFST-519-601", "PSCI-319-601", "ENVS-619-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/9921/sections/601/reviews/3619-PETER-J--ROGERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3619-PETER-J--ROGERS", "first_name": "PETER J.", "last_name": "ROGERS", "id": "3619-PETER-J--ROGERS", "name": "PETER J.
