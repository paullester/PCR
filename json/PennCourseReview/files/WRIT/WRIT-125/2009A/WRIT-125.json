Food is about more than just eating, it is about appetite, taste, emotion, conversation, and culture. The art of eating is a class designed to educate your palates and sensibilities via writing. The two central texts of this class are: American Food Writing: An Anthology with Classic Recipes and The Gastronomical Me, by M.F.K. Fisher. Last, you will also have the opportunity to take field trips and discover Philadelphia through its food.\r\n\r\nMany students found the class to be a positive experience in several ways. \u201cFood is a bonus!\u201d one student pointed out. However, many found that the format of the Critical Writing seminar was not conducive to learning in this particular class, and in fact \u201champered\u201d their creativity. Students who were disappointed with the overall Critical Writing seminar structure said, \u201cyou might as well take [a writing seminar] from a professor who actually apologizes for having to teach the content.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Devaney\u2014described in terms such as \u201camazing\u201d, \u201ceccentric\u201d, \u201cdown to earth\u201d, and \u201chilarious\u201d\u2014earned applause for being able to compensate for some of the problems attributed to the Writing Seminar structure. \u201cThe things we talked about post-Bruffee were definitely worth it,\u201d one student said. Another of his 16 students, however, noted that he had trouble remembering students\u2019 names despite an entire semester\u2019s worth of work on their writing.", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/16599/sections/301/reviews/1829-THOMAS-E-DEVANEY-JR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1829-THOMAS-E-DEVANEY-JR", "first_name": "THOMAS E", "last_name": "DEVANEY JR", "id": "1829-THOMAS-E-DEVANEY-JR", "name": "THOMAS E DEVANEY JR"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "16599-301-1829-THOMAS-E-DEVANEY-JR"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.88", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "1.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "1.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.25", "rReadingsValue": "1.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "1.25", "rInstructorQuality": "0.88"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: TELEVISION CRITICISM", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-302", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/302", "id": "16599-302", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/16599/sections/302/reviews/4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "first_name": "JO ANN", "last_name": "CAPLIN", "id": "4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "name": "JO ANN CAPLIN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "16599-302-4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.14", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "1.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: BROADCAST JOURNALISM", "sectionnum": "303", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-303", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/303", "id": "16599-303", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-303"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/16599/sections/303/reviews/4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "first_name": "JO ANN", "last_name": "CAPLIN", "id": "4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "name": "JO ANN CAPLIN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "16599-303-4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.75", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: SOMETHING ABOUT A HORSE", "sectionnum": "304", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-304", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/304", "id": "16599-304", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-304"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/16599/sections/304/reviews/418-ARTHUR-D-CASCIATO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/418-ARTHUR-D-CASCIATO", "first_name": "ARTHUR D", "last_name": "CASCIATO", "id": "418-ARTHUR-D-CASCIATO", "name": "ARTHUR D CASCIATO"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "16599-304-418-ARTHUR-D-CASCIATO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "WRIT-125", "path": "/courses/16599", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16599/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: THE ART OF EATING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-301", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/301", "id": "16599-301", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-301"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: TELEVISION CRITICISM", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-302", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/302", "id": "16599-302", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-302"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: BROADCAST JOURNALISM", "sectionnum": "303", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-303", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/303", "id": "16599-303", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-303"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN WRIT: SOMETHING ABOUT A HORSE", "sectionnum": "304", "primary_alias": "WRIT-125-304", "path": "/courses/16599/sections/304", "id": "16599-304", "aliases": ["WRIT-125-304"]}]}, "id": 16599, "aliases": ["WRIT-125"]}
