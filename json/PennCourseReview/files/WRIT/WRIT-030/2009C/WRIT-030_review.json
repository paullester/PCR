After defining propaganda, students will consider the role it plays in a democratic society, focusing on questions such as: When is it ethical for a government to use propaganda? How has the use of propaganda benefited social causes like the environmental movement? Has propaganda changed with the invention of social networking technology? This course will also consider whether consenting citizens and consumers have a role to play in propaganda, and question how one measures propaganda's success. Students will have the opportunity to explore their ideas about propaganda in a range of short assignments while developing skills including a peer review, revision, argumentation, reasoning, and audience awareness.&#8232;\r\n&#8232;Students found the course topic and subject matter to be very interesting; however, many complained that the flaw in this class was the \u201cconcept of the writing seminar itself\u201d. The structure of writing seminars and the requisite workload made the study of propaganda \u201doften tedious and quite time-consuming\u201d. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents found Professor Legrand to be a \u201ccompetent writing instructor\u201d, but \u201cquite unapproachable\u201d and not giving \u201cadequate feedback\u201d. However, some students did enjoy his teaching style and felt their writing styles were improved with his help. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nThe workload for this class was \u201cstandard across all critical writing seminars\u201d, and the course reading was described as \u201cinteresting\u201d. Some assignments, such as descriptive outlines, were \u201ctedious\u201d, but the subject matter allowed for opportunities to write interesting papers.\r\n", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/18195/sections/305/reviews/4597-RODGER-C-LEGRAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4597-RODGER-C-LEGRAND", "first_name": "RODGER C", "last_name": "LEGRAND", "id": "4597-RODGER-C-LEGRAND", "name": "RODGER C LEGRAND"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "18195-305-4597-RODGER-C-LEGRAND"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "1.75", "rCourseQuality": "1.78", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.25", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "CRITICAL WRITING SEMINAR: DAVINCI SCIENTIST ARTIST", "sectionnum": "306", "primary_alias": "WRIT-030-306", "path": "/courses/18195/sections/306", "id": "18195-306", "aliases": ["WRIT-030-306"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/18195/sections/306/reviews/4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "first_name": "JO ANN", "last_name": "CAPLIN", "id": "4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN", "name": "JO ANN CAPLIN"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "18195-306-4617-JO-ANN-CAPLIN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.91", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "2.36", "rRecommendMajor": "2.27", "rCourseQuality": "1.93", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.27", "rCommAbility": "2.64", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "CRITICAL WRITING SEMINAR: EUROPEAN & AMERICAN IDEN", "sectionnum": "307", "primary_alias": "WRIT-030-307", "path": "/courses/18195/sections/307", "id": "18195-307", "aliases": ["WRIT-030-307"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/18195/sections/307/reviews/399-MICHAEL-A-BURRI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/399-MICHAEL-A-BURRI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A", "last_name": "BURRI", "id": "399-MICHAEL-A-BURRI", "name": "MICHAEL A BURRI"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "18195-307-399-MICHAEL-A-BURRI"}]
