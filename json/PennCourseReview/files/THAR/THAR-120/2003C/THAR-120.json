{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1119"}, "description": "Rooted in the system devised by Constantin Stanislavsky, this course takes students step by step through the practical work an actor must do to live and behave truthfully on-stage. Beginning with relaxation and physical exercise, interactive games, and ensemble building, students then learn and put into practice basic acting techniques, including sensory work, the principles of action, objectives, given circumstances, etc. The semester culminates in the performance of a scene or scenes, most often from a modern American play. This course strongly stresses a commitment to actor work and responsibility to one's fellow actors. Practical work is supplemented by readings from Stanislavksy and a variety of other acting theorists that may include Uta Hagen, Robert Cohen, Stella Adler, among others. Students are required to submit short essays over the course of the semester in response to the readings and in preparation for their final scene project. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO ACTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4793/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.79", "rDifficulty": "1.79", "rStimulateInterest": "3.37", "rRecommendMajor": "3.74", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.68", "rCommAbility": "3.32", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO ACTING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-120-301", "path": "/courses/4793/sections/301", "id": "4793-301", "aliases": ["THAR-120-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/4793/sections/301/reviews/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "first_name": "MARCIA", "last_name": "FERGUSON", "id": "1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "name": "MARCIA FERGUSON"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "4793-301-1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.69", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.94", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO ACTING", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "THAR-120-302", "path": "/courses/4793/sections/302", "id": "4793-302", "aliases": ["THAR-120-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/4793/sections/302/reviews/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "first_name": "ROSEMARY", "last_name": "MALAGUE", "id": "1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "name": "ROSEMARY MALAGUE"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "4793-302-1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "1.53", "rStimulateInterest": "3.94", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.59", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.88", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO ACTING", "sectionnum": "303", "primary_alias": "THAR-120-303", "path": "/courses/4793/sections/303", "id": "4793-303", "aliases": ["THAR-120-303"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/4793/sections/303/reviews/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "first_name": "JAMES F.", "last_name": "SCHLATTER", "id": "1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "name": "JAMES F.
