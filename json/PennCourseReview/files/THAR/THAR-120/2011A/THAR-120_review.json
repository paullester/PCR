Beginning with relaxation and physical exercise, interactive games, and ensemble building, students then learn and put into practice basic acting techniques. The semester culminates in the performance of a scene or scenes, most often from a modern American play. Readings by Stanislavksy, Uta Hagen, Robert Cohen, and Stella Adler among others supplements practical work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \u201cexcellent\u201d course gave an \u201cinsightful look into what it takes to be an actor,\u201d and provided a good mix of \u201cphysical, mental, and psychological stimulation.\u201d Students found this class to be especially \u201cengaging\u201d and thoroughly enjoyed the semester.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ferguson was a \u201cwonderful teacher.\u201d She fostered \u201ca very open and friendly environment for students to grow and develop as actors\u201d throughout the entirety of the class. \r\n\r\nStudents submitted short essays over the course of the semester in response to the readings and in preparation for their final scene project. Some students wished rehearsal time had been held outside of class hours to allow for more time to practice.
