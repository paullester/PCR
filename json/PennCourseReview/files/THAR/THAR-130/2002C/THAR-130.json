{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2165"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the traditional elements of scenic composition, including stage scenery and props, lighting, costume and sound design. Students will gain an appreciation for the breadth of historic scenic convention as well as an understanding of the roles played by historic convention in modern stagecraft. Theatrical relationships between actor/audience/setting/text will be examined using the analysis of play scripts, theatre history, theoretical writings, illustrations and other media as a series of case studies. Emphasis will be given to an understanding of the role of design and technology in the transformational event of the theatre production, and the various contextual approaches that inform the design process, including the role of the theatre designer/technician as artist and collaborator within the framework of the production team. Project work in this course includes design studies, research and critical writing, project presentation, and a practicum project associated with the Theatre Arts Program production schedule. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "INTRO LIGHT,SET,COSTUME", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3596/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "1.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.40", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO LIGHT,SET,COSTUME", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-130-601", "path": "/courses/3596/sections/601", "id": "3596-601", "aliases": ["THAR-130-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/3596/sections/601/reviews/1185-PETER-B-WHINNERY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1185-PETER-B-WHINNERY", "first_name": "PETER B", "last_name": "WHINNERY", "id": "1185-PETER-B-WHINNERY", "name": "PETER B WHINNERY"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "3596-601-1185-PETER-B-WHINNERY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-130", "path": "/courses/3596", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3596/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO LIGHT,SET,COSTUME", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-130-601", "path": "/courses/3596/sections/601", "id": "3596-601", "aliases": ["THAR-130-601"]}]}, "id": 3596, "aliases": ["THAR-130"]}
