{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1124"}, "description": "The primary goal of this course is to develop students' practical skills and methods as stage directors. The course continues the work of Introduction to Directing, focusing on effective text analysis, communicating with actors, and use of theatrical space and movement to tell the story of the play. The course is structured as a workshop, with students presenting and discussing each other's scene work in class. Students are responsible for three large projects, and each project is presented and discussed twice, first in its workshop and then in its final stage of development. The final project involves minimally staging a one-act play for an audience. Course work is supplemented by readings on the work of major modern directors, and by viewing and writing critiques of selected theatre performances. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ADVANCED DIRECTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2306/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-221", "path": "/courses/2306", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2306/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED DIRECTING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-221-301", "path": "/courses/2306/sections/301", "id": "2306-301", "aliases": ["THAR-221-301"]}]}, "id": 2306, "aliases": ["THAR-221"]}
