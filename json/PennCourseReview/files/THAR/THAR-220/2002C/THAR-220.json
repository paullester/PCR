{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1123"}, "description": "This course continues the work begun in the Introduction to Acting class. The specific focus of the course will be on helping students to connect more deeply and truthfully with each other on stage, freeing up the body of the actor to fulfill the physical demands of characterization, and analyzing the dramatic text to clarify objectives and focus action through unit breakdown. Attention will also be given to helping students work through specific problems and personal, creative obstacles. The basis of the course will be scene work taken from the twentieth-century repertoire (realist and non-realist plays), a classical monologue, and exercises taken from a variety of performance traditions. The course also includes readings from modern theorists and practitioners. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "ADVANCED ACTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3599/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.58", "rDifficulty": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.08", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED ACTING", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-220-601", "path": "/courses/3599/sections/601", "id": "3599-601", "aliases": ["THAR-220-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/3599/sections/601/reviews/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "first_name": "ROSEMARY", "last_name": "MALAGUE", "id": "1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "name": "ROSEMARY MALAGUE"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "3599-601-1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-220", "path": "/courses/3599", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3599/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED ACTING", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-220-601", "path": "/courses/3599/sections/601", "id": "3599-601", "aliases": ["THAR-220-601"]}]}, "id": 3599, "aliases": ["THAR-220"]}
