{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3218"}, "description": "(Replaced after summer 2008 with PPE 113) This course will provide an example driven first course in Game Theory, with an emphasis on applications. We will look at games in strategic forms, games in extensive forms, static games, dynamic games, games of complete and incomplete information, Nash equilibrium, the plausibility of Nash equilibrium as a prediction of outcomes, and alternative equilibrium concepts such as rationalizability. These concepts will be taught at an intuitive level, accompanied by lots of class discussion and examples. The examples will be drawn from Economics, Political Science, Philosophy and Computer Science. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "INTRO TO GAME THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20710/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.07", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "1.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO GAME THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PPE-111-001", "path": "/courses/20710/sections/001", "id": "20710-001", "aliases": ["PPE-111-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/20710/sections/001/reviews/3150-SUMANTRA-SEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3150-SUMANTRA-SEN", "first_name": "SUMANTRA", "last_name": "SEN", "id": "3150-SUMANTRA-SEN", "name": "SUMANTRA SEN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "20710-001-3150-SUMANTRA-SEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PPE-111", "path": "/courses/20710", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20710/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO GAME THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PPE-111-001", "path": "/courses/20710/sections/001", "id": "20710-001", "aliases": ["PPE-111-001"]}]}, "id": 20710, "aliases": ["PPE-111"]}
