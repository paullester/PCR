{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2657"}, "description": "The course studies the fundamental principles of decision-making and applies them to a variety of social activities. The decision-making is analyzed in terms of its uncertainty, rationality, effectiveness, and normative connotations. After the notion of rationality is introduced, rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability,in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations, for instance, the effective choice must reach an equilibrium, i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation, defection, resoluteness, and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions, political campaigning and voting, military threats and deterrence. The courses uses the classical studies of Steven J. Brams, William H. Riker, Amaratya K. Sen, and Michael Taylor. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "DECISION AND GAME THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5769/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.08", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "DECISION AND GAME THEORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PPE-222-301", "path": "/courses/5769/sections/301", "id": "5769-301", "aliases": ["PPE-222-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/5769/sections/301/reviews/1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ", "first_name": "WALDEMAR", "last_name": "HANASZ", "id": "1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ", "name": "WALDEMAR HANASZ"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "5769-301-1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PPE-222", "path": "/courses/5769", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5769/sections", "values": [{"name": "DECISION AND GAME THEORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PPE-222-301", "path": "/courses/5769/sections/301", "id": "5769-301", "aliases": ["PPE-222-301"]}]}, "id": 5769, "aliases": ["PPE-222"]}
