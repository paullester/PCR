{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1449"}, "description": "The Course explores the development of economic theory for antiquity to the twentieth century. Students read and discuss a rich collection of writing from Aristotle and Aquinas to Marshall and Keynes, with special attention to Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx. The course pays special interdisciplinary attention to many historical (great events, social changes), political (governmental involvement in the economy, the process of democratization), and philosophical (theories of value, the notions of freedom,equality, and fairness) factors that shaped economic thinking and economy. Many fascinating questions are discussed. What are the economic values and goods? How are those goods created? How do we value them? What is the role of labor in creating these goods? And what is the role of trade and money? What is the state's role? What is the role of freedom, equality, and other political values in the economic process? In the past, these questions were considered so important that the greatest thinkers and philosophers discussed them. The course attempts to illustrate that great tradition and attract students' attention to the fundamental economic concepts. In addition, the methodological evolution of the scientific status of economic theory is examined. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "HIST ECONOMIC THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12309/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.33", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "HIST ECONOMIC THEORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PPE-231-301", "path": "/courses/12309/sections/301", "id": "12309-301", "aliases": ["PPE-231-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/12309/sections/301/reviews/1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ", "first_name": "WALDEMAR", "last_name": "HANASZ", "id": "1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ", "name": "WALDEMAR HANASZ"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "12309-301-1677-WALDEMAR-HANASZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PPE-231", "path": "/courses/12309", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12309/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST ECONOMIC THEORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PPE-231-301", "path": "/courses/12309/sections/301", "id": "12309-301", "aliases": ["PPE-231-301"]}]}, "id": 12309, "aliases": ["PPE-231"]}
