Although Professor Baron is a well-known figure in the field of decision research, he often rambles in lectures and makes it difficult to pay attention. He often left students \u201cdeeply confused\u201d due to his tangential speech. Professor Baron also had difficulty stimulating student interest. \r\n\r\nEconomics majors and minors, as well as psychology majors, were the large majority of students that took this course.

Students seemed to agree that, overall, they did not find the course an overly positive experience and many echoed the opinion that the teaching could definitely be improved.     \r\n\r\n", "num_students": 100, "path": "/courses/25036/sections/401/reviews/1694-JONATHAN-M-BARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1694-JONATHAN-M-BARON", "first_name": "JONATHAN M", "last_name": "BARON", "id": "1694-JONATHAN-M-BARON", "name": "JONATHAN M BARON"}, "num_reviewers": 85, "id": "25036-401-1694-JONATHAN-M-BARON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.18", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.32", "rCourseQuality": "1.90", "rWorkRequired": "1.88", "rInstructorAccess": "2.76", "rReadingsValue": "1.84", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.28", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "JUDGMENT AND DECISIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-253-401", "path": "/courses/25036/sections/401", "id": "25036-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-253-401", "PPE-153-401"]}, "comments": "Psychology 253 is a course that focuses on processes of thinking, judgment, and personal and societal decision-making.
