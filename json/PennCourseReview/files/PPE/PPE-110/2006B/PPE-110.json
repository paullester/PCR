{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3490"}, "description": "This course will provide an introduction to models of human decision making. One of the primary purposes of the course is to provide a set of basic tools that will help the student translate uncertainty into numbers. Rational choice under uncertainty is by far the most used theory of decision making, and its applications are widespread in economics, finance, political science, law, managerial decision making, the economics of health care, and artificial intelligence. The course will use examples from each of these fields (and also fun \"paradoxes\" such as the Monty Hall Puzzle) in providing an introduction to the basic foundations of decision making. We will also look at the shortcomings of the rational choice theory: both from intuitive and empirical perspectives. No mathematical prerequisites are necessary beyond high school algebra and arithmetic. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "INTRO TO DECISION THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9852/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO DECISION THEORY", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "PPE-110-920", "path": "/courses/9852/sections/920", "id": "9852-920", "aliases": ["PPE-110-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/9852/sections/920/reviews/3150-SUMANTRA-SEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3150-SUMANTRA-SEN", "first_name": "SUMANTRA", "last_name": "SEN", "id": "3150-SUMANTRA-SEN", "name": "SUMANTRA SEN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "9852-920-3150-SUMANTRA-SEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PPE-110", "path": "/courses/9852", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9852/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO DECISION THEORY", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "PPE-110-920", "path": "/courses/9852/sections/920", "id": "9852-920", "aliases": ["PPE-110-920"]}]}, "id": 9852, "aliases": ["PPE-110"]}
