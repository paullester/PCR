Topics to be considered include the formation of the Greek polis, the rising and falling fortunes of Athens and the other Greek city-states in the Classical period, and the world of Alexander the Great. Emphasis is placed on the consideration of the archaeological evidence, e.g., sculpture, painting, pottery, architecture, and other material culture. This course is part of a sequence of introductory courses (with Ages of Homer and Introduction to Roman Archaeology) on the archaeology of the Greco-Roman world. There are no prerequisites, and these courses need not be taken in a particular order. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRO GREEK ARCHAEOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28747/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "1.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO GREEK ARCHAEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-275-401", "path": "/courses/28747/sections/401", "id": "28747-401", "aliases": ["CLST-275-401", "AAMW-401-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/28747/sections/401/reviews/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "first_name": "THOMAS F.", "last_name": "TARTARON", "id": "3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "name": "THOMAS F.
