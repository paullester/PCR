Students generally expressed satisfaction with the course.  Most students found the readings and lectures interesting; however, several students noted that certain topics (namely Homer\u2019s Odyssey) were simply a review for most students.  Most agreed that they came away from the course with a new appreciation for mythology, although some failed to see how the course would advance their overall studies.  Students found the course generally well-structured, describing the lectures as \u201ccaptivating.\u201d  Students were generally less enthusiastic about the out-of-class work, occasionally perceiving it as \u201coverkill.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Struck received rather positive reviews.  Students regarded him as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cengaging.\u201d  Participants found his lectures greatly enhanced by his \u201coverwhelming passion for the material.\u201d  He was further lauded as \u201cclear,\u201d \u201chumble,\u201d and \u201csimply the best professor at Penn.\u201d  Even students who were slightly frustrated by certain elements of the course had enormous praise for Professor Struck.\r\n\r\nThe class\u2019s main pitfall, according to most respondents, was the frequency of assignments.  Weekly written responses and quizzes caused students to feel \u201coverwhelmed\u201d or \u201caggravated\u201d by the course.  Readings were described as \u201cvery interesting, but simply too long.\u201d  While students considered the grading generally \u201cfair,\u201d most noted that they wished they had been given fewer, more thorough assignments, as opposed to such frequent assessments.  Students from a variety of disciplines enrolled in the course, most of whom recommended the course to peers.", "num_students": 223, "path": "/courses/27185/sections/401/reviews/259-PETER-T--STRUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/259-PETER-T--STRUCK", "first_name": "PETER T.", "last_name": "STRUCK", "id": "259-PETER-T--STRUCK", "name": "PETER T.
