{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3536"}, "description": "This course will introduce you to the \"roots\" of the western dramatic tradition by surveying a number of well-known tragedies and comedies from Greco-Roman antiquity. Although the syllabus varies slightly from year to year, students can expect to read such influential works as Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\" and Aristophanes' \"Clouds.\" In addition to reading the plays themselves, students will gain insight into the reception of dramatic performances in the ancient world. Individual authors and works will be presented within their historical contexts and we will attend to matters such as staging of drama, the evolution of theatrical performance, and interpretation of ancient drama as social and/or political commentary. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "ANCIENT THEATER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9686/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.86", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.57", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "ANCIENT THEATER", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "CLST-141-920", "path": "/courses/9686/sections/920", "id": "9686-920", "aliases": ["CLST-141-920", "THAR-141-920", "ENGL-103-920", "COML-264-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/9686/sections/920/reviews/1535-JACQUES-A--BROMBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1535-JACQUES-A--BROMBERG", "first_name": "JACQUES A.", "last_name": "BROMBERG", "id": "1535-JACQUES-A--BROMBERG", "name": "JACQUES A.
