{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2765"}, "description": "We will take into account the development of the city of Athens from the Mycenaean period to Late Antiquity but will concentrate on the era when the city was at its height, from the sixth to fourth centuries B.C. We will examine the great public places--notably, the sanctuary of Athena on the Acropolis and the political and commercial core of the Agora--and will explore as well the neighborhoods with their private houses, small shrines, fountain houses and craft workshops. \n\nWe will also turn to the port of Peiraeus, which was so essential to Athens' trade and naval power and which in its layout and in the character of its population contrasted sharply with Athens itself. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "THE ANC.
