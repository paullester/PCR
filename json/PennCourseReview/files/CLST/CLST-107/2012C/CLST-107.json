{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5526"}, "description": "Tragedy poses the fundamental questions of what it means to be human. What motivates our actions and interactions? What constitutes individual and and collective identities? How do we grapple with the constraints of the past, suffering, unknown futures? To what extent are we resilient after betrayal and disillusionment? Ancient tragedies stage a spectrum of human experiences and psychology (and pathology), from heroism to passion to grief and revenge. \n\nIn this course we will train our interpretive gaze on Greek and Roman plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Seneca, examining such topics as 'justice', 'love and madness', 'fate and self-knowledge', 'sweet revenge', and 'gods and mortals'. We will go on to trace the tragic tradition in post-classical plays by Marlowe, Shakespeare, Racine, and Dove. Finally, we will examine some inheritors of tragedy in non-dramatic media-film, music, the visual arts, -with an eye to both continuities with and deviations from the the ancient models. Selected critical and theoretical readings will complement our study of tragedy's central themes. Class will be run seminar-style: a combination of lecture and discussion. All readings will be in English; knowledge of Greek and Latin is not required. Course requirements consist of written responses, quizzes, oral presentations, and a choice of final exam or final paper. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "TRAGEDY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28742/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "TRAGEDY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CLST-107-601", "path": "/courses/28742/sections/601", "id": "28742-601", "aliases": ["CLST-107-601", "COML-130-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/28742/sections/601/reviews/4001-CARRIE-M-MOWBRAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4001-CARRIE-M-MOWBRAY", "first_name": "CARRIE M", "last_name": "MOWBRAY", "id": "4001-CARRIE-M-MOWBRAY", "name": "CARRIE M MOWBRAY"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "28742-601-4001-CARRIE-M-MOWBRAY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-107", "path": "/courses/28742", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28742/sections", "values": [{"name": "TRAGEDY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CLST-107-601", "path": "/courses/28742/sections/601", "id": "28742-601", "aliases": ["CLST-107-601", "COML-130-601"]}]}, "id": 28742, "aliases": ["CLST-107", "COML-130"]}
