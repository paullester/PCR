{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2057"}, "description": "An investigation of the origins of the western ethical tradition, starting with the works of Plato and Aristotle in Classical Greek Philosophy, and following through with the Epicurean and Stoic schools in later Greek and Roman philosophy. Ethics, in this tradition, is concerned less with the specific practical issues that dominate contemporary discussions (e.g. the morality of abortion or capital punishment or the extent of our obligation to aid those in need), than with broader, more general questions such as \"How should one live\"? \"What is the relative importance of material success, family and fiendship, sexual intimacy, and intellectual activity, in a successful human life?\" \"What is the correct way to conduct ourselves in relation to the divine?\" \"Is emotion a good or a bad thing in human life?\" Readings will include works by Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca. All texts will be read in English translation. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "GREEK & ROMAN ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5737/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "2.61", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "GREEK & ROMAN ETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-211-401", "path": "/courses/5737/sections/401", "id": "5737-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-211-401", "CLST-211-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/5737/sections/401/reviews/1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER", "first_name": "SUSAN SAUVE", "last_name": "MEYER", "id": "1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER", "name": "SUSAN SAUVE MEYER"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "5737-401-1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-211", "path": "/courses/5737", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5737/sections", "values": [{"name": "GREEK & ROMAN ETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-211-401", "path": "/courses/5737/sections/401", "id": "5737-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-211-401", "CLST-211-401"]}]}, "id": 5737, "aliases": ["PHIL-211", "CLST-211"]}
