{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4920"}, "description": "In this course we will study the Sophists in Antiquity and in their post- classical reception. The teachers, rhetoricians, and philosophers of 5th- century Athens known collectively as the Sophists were controversial in their own time, and they have occupied a controversial place in intellectual and culture ever since. Plato polemicized against them, Aristophanes satirized themmercilessly, Aristotle refuted them, and generations of rhetorical theorists in Greek and Latin attempted to differentiate their art from the supposedly debased model of sophistic rhetoric. Sophistic thought found its way indirectly but powerfully into the Middle Ages and later periods, where it represented both a despised falsification of philosophical argument and a dangerously attractive logic of paradox. Culturally the (spectral) figure of the Sophist served as image of both the familiar and the outsider. As in Antiquity, so in later periods the Sophist came to embody anxieties about persuasive discourse and negation. But in modern period, the Sophists were recovered and \"rehabilitated\" as a crucial moment in the history of philosophy,and among modern thinkers their contributions have been reevaluated. \n\nIn this course we will begin by getting as close as possible to the Sophists through the fragmentary records that remain of their own ideas and arguments, and then we will look at how they were represented philosophically by Plato and Aristotle as well as culturally by Aristophanes. Then we will study their afterlife in later periods, paying special attention to their reception in medieval literature and in modern thought. Course requirements: several short papers, one final research assignment, no final exam. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "THE SOPHISTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21482/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "THE SOPHISTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CLST-261-001", "path": "/courses/21482/sections/001", "id": "21482-001", "aliases": ["CLST-261-001", "COML-246-001", "ENGL-229-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/21482/sections/001/reviews/256-RITA-COPELAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/256-RITA-COPELAND", "first_name": "RITA", "last_name": "COPELAND", "id": "256-RITA-COPELAND", "name": "RITA COPELAND"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "21482-001-256-RITA-COPELAND"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-261", "path": "/courses/21482", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21482/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE SOPHISTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CLST-261-001", "path": "/courses/21482/sections/001", "id": "21482-001", "aliases": ["CLST-261-001", "COML-246-001", "ENGL-229-001"]}]}, "id": 21482, "aliases": ["CLST-261", "COML-246", "ENGL-229"]}
