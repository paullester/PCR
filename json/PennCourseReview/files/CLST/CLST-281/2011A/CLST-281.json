{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4921"}, "description": "By shortly after 1200 B.C., the great Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age had all been destroyed, ushering in a period of demographic instability and political decentralization in Greece, in which most of the material and social aspects of Mycenaean palatial life disappeared. The period from ca. 1200800 B.C. has typically been viewed as a Dark Age, a time of retrenchment and a return to simple farming and pastoralism in small, isolated communities. In recent years this view of a relatively complete cultural and material break has been challenged by investigations at a number of sites on the Greek mainland and islands and beyond. With a basic theme of continuity and change, this course attempts to present a more balanced picture of Greek life from the demise of the palaces to the 8th century renaissance in Greece. Language, religion, social and political organization, economy, and long-distance contacts are explored, as is the relevance of the Homeric epics to this period. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "GREEK DARK AGES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21483/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.80", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "1.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "GREEK DARK AGES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CLST-281-001", "path": "/courses/21483/sections/001", "id": "21483-001", "aliases": ["CLST-281-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/21483/sections/001/reviews/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "first_name": "THOMAS F.", "last_name": "TARTARON", "id": "3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "name": "THOMAS F.
