{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/283"}, "description": "The critical theorist Edward Said has written, \"The Orient had been since antiquity a place of romance, exotic beings, haunting memories and landscapes, remarkable experiences.\" In this course, we will explore the west's visualization of \"The Orient\" by focusing upon three specific locations: the mid-east as antiquity's \"original orient\" and south-east Asia and India/Tibet as the contemporary west's locations for war/darkness and peace/enlightenment, respectively. We will use theoretical work, fiction, and travel writing (ancient and modern) to supplement our examination of films such as Apocalypse Now, The Cup, The Man Who Would Be King, Three Seasons, and A Year of Living Dangerously. By working between and among a variety of media, we will be able to attend not only to what \"the Orient\" is or means but to the process of that imagining process. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "IMAGINING THE ORIENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/283/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.23", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "IMAGINING THE ORIENT", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "CLST-508-640", "path": "/courses/283/sections/640", "id": "283-640", "aliases": ["CLST-508-640", "FILM-508-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/283/sections/640/reviews/260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE", "first_name": "JACQUELINE", "last_name": "SADASHIGE", "id": "260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE", "name": "JACQUELINE SADASHIGE"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "283-640-260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-508", "path": "/courses/283", "sections": {"path": "/courses/283/sections", "values": [{"name": "IMAGINING THE ORIENT", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "CLST-508-640", "path": "/courses/283/sections/640", "id": "283-640", "aliases": ["CLST-508-640", "FILM-508-640"]}]}, "id": 283, "aliases": ["CLST-508", "FILM-508"]}
