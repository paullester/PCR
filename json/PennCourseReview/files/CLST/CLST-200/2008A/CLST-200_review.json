Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as a few contemporary American ones, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. The class will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions through a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals, religion and family, sex, love, madness, and death.\r\n\r\nMultiple students praised this class as the best they\u2019ve ever taken, describing it as \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cfun.\u201d  They commented that the readings were interesting and they learned a lot about a subject most knew little about before taking the course.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Struck as \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201cfunny.\u201d  Multiple students commented that he is one of the best professors they\u2019ve ever had.
