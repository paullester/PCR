Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage over adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as a contemporary American ones, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their ownmyths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals, religion and family, sex,love, madness, and death. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "GREEK & ROMAN MYTHOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12585/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-200", "path": "/courses/12585", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12585/sections", "values": [{"name": "GREEK & ROMAN MYTHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "935", "primary_alias": "CLST-200-935", "path": "/courses/12585/sections/935", "id": "12585-935", "aliases": ["CLST-200-935", "COML-200-935", "FOLK-200-935"]}]}, "id": 12585, "aliases": ["CLST-200", "COML-200", "FOLK-200"]}
