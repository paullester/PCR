{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4917"}, "description": "In this course, we will study what continuities there are between contemporary society and those of ancient Greece and Rome; the ways in which our culture is fundamentally different from theirs; and the reasons why medieval, early modern, and modern people have chosen either to look back to antiquity, or to turn away from it. Is our identity shaped by the Greeks and Romans, or not? And how did we get from their culture to our own? We will survey different strands of the \"classical tradition\", ranging through literature, history, philosophy, art, science, language and psychology. We will also think about what the terms \"classical\" and \"tradition\" might mean. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CLASSICAL TRADITIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24195/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "CLASSICAL TRADITIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-102-401", "path": "/courses/24195/sections/401", "id": "24195-401", "aliases": ["CLST-102-401", "ENGL-029-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/24195/sections/401/reviews/1472-EMILY-R--C--WILSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1472-EMILY-R--C--WILSON", "first_name": "EMILY R.
