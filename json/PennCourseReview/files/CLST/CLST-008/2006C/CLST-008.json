{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3321"}, "description": "This course is an introductory-level class in rhetoric and speaking. It has three main goals: to introduce students to ancient rhetoric; to learn how to draw from these Classical principles to put together articulate and persuasive speeches; and to explore the formidable role rhetoric plays in the construction of our own world. Students will study both Classical and contemporary speaking. Assignments will teach students to analyze, compose and deliver public speeches, while weekly oral presentations and peer-review will further their understanding of effective argumentation and criticism. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "ANC RHET & MOD SPEAKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8688/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ANC RHET & MOD SPEAKING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-008-301", "path": "/courses/8688/sections/301", "id": "8688-301", "aliases": ["CLST-008-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/8688/sections/301/reviews/1535-JACQUES-A--BROMBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1535-JACQUES-A--BROMBERG", "first_name": "JACQUES A.", "last_name": "BROMBERG", "id": "1535-JACQUES-A--BROMBERG", "name": "JACQUES A.
