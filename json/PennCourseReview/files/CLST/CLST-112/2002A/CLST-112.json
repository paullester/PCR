{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/272"}, "description": "The Iliad and the Odyssey have won great admiration from hearers and readers for close to three millenia. They have also provoked many questions about the poet or poets, the date of works, the nature of their composition and transmission, and the historical reality, if any, of the war and the society they evoke. In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we will undertake a literary and archaeological and historical study of Troy and Greecefrom the 13th century B.C., the earliest time conjectured for the Trojan War, down to the 7th century B.C., the latest possible date for composition. In addition to studying the two Homeric epics, we will do comparative reading in other early Greek literatureand the Hebrew Bible. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "HOMER & TROY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/272/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.25", "rDifficulty": "1.25", "rStimulateInterest": "1.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.75", "rCommAbility": "1.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "HOMER & TROY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-112-301", "path": "/courses/272/sections/301", "id": "272-301", "aliases": ["CLST-112-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/272/sections/301/reviews/255-KEITH-R-DEVRIES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/255-KEITH-R-DEVRIES", "first_name": "KEITH R", "last_name": "DEVRIES", "id": "255-KEITH-R-DEVRIES", "name": "KEITH R DEVRIES"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "272-301-255-KEITH-R-DEVRIES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-112", "path": "/courses/272", "sections": {"path": "/courses/272/sections", "values": [{"name": "HOMER & TROY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-112-301", "path": "/courses/272/sections/301", "id": "272-301", "aliases": ["CLST-112-301"]}]}, "id": 272, "aliases": ["CLST-112"]}
