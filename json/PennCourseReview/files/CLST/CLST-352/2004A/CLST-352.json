{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/280"}, "description": "Mythos and Logos are often perceived as representing two opposite approaches toreality: the former tending towards an irrational, sometimes even superstitiousone, the latter to a systematically rational one. This division arose already in Ancient Greece, where the rationalism of figures such as the Sophists castedaway the ancient mythological stories along with the religious practices and beliefs to favor a more pragmatic view of things. Yet, are Mythos and Logos really to be so drastically separated? In Plato's works Mythos and Logos are not presented as two completely separated concepts. On the contrary Plato often uses myths to clarify his ideas and more than that to express the inexpressible. In this course we will examine how the myths and the Mythos are used in Plato's philosophy as a means to express through language what is beyond language and can barely be grasped by human thought. \n\nOne of the three weekly meetings of the seminar will take place at University City High School (UCHS). We will work closely with a high school class and their teacher at UCHS, using Plato as a springboard for discovery and discussion. Such a format would surely please Socrates himself, who held that ongoing dialogue with others consitutes the truest philosophical enterprise. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "TEACHING PLATO REPUBLIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6320/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.37", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "3.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79", "rReadingsValue": "3.68", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.37", "rCommAbility": "3.74", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "TEACHING PLATO REPUBLIC", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-352-301", "path": "/courses/6320/sections/301", "id": "6320-301", "aliases": ["CLST-352-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/6320/sections/301/reviews/262-RALPH-M--ROSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/262-RALPH-M--ROSEN", "first_name": "RALPH M.", "last_name": "ROSEN", "id": "262-RALPH-M--ROSEN", "name": "RALPH M.
