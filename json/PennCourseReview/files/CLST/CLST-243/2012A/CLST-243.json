{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5394"}, "description": "Was there a stable conception of the \"author\" and his or her activities within society? What practices were involved in the reading (or hearing) of literature and its interpretation by specific communities? What was a literary work -- what forms did it take, what imaginary and real-world themes did it explore, and what functions could it serve? This course seeks to address these questions with readings from significant works, from archaic Greece to Rome and early Christianity, in an overview of the major (and some minor) authors in the Greek and Roman tradition (such as Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Lucretius, Ovid, , and Augustine). Students will complete regular readings (all in English) and other assignments including: oral presentation, paper, midterm, and final examination. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Authors and Audiences of the Greek and Roman World", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27187/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.89", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "Authors and Audiences of the Greek and Roman World", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-243-301", "path": "/courses/27187/sections/301", "id": "27187-301", "aliases": ["CLST-243-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/27187/sections/301/reviews/2424-JAMES-KER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2424-JAMES-KER", "first_name": "JAMES", "last_name": "KER", "id": "2424-JAMES-KER", "name": "JAMES KER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "27187-301-2424-JAMES-KER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-243", "path": "/courses/27187", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27187/sections", "values": [{"name": "Authors and Audiences of the Greek and Roman World", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-243-301", "path": "/courses/27187/sections/301", "id": "27187-301", "aliases": ["CLST-243-301"]}]}, "id": 27187, "aliases": ["CLST-243"]}
