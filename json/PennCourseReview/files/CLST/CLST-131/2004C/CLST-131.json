{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2494"}, "description": "This seminar approaches classical Roman culture through one of it's most bizarre historical figures: Nero, the last of the Julio-Claudian emperor's. How are we to understand the mystique of the actor-emperor, the aesthete-tyrant who played the lyre while Rome burned? What cultural forces came into play to create the cruel but charming persona which imposters around the Mediterranean would seek to imitate even after his death? Because Nero lives on in such a broad set of representations both ancient and modern, he gives us the opportunity to work methodically through the different ways in which our knowledge and fantasies of the profound past are mediated-fantasies about art, power, spectacle, violence, bodies, nature, identity. We will also compare the different modes of viewing that are made available by archaeology, including Roman coins, sculpture, wall-painting, architechure, and town-planning. But we will devote equal energy to analyzing how the Roman past, and Nero in particular, has been projected in modern times, through opera, fiction, film, and popular culture. Ultimately, we will seek to interpret the ways in which power is performed and transmitted in this complelling myth-from Nero to his Roman audiences, and from the ancient past into the present. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "NERO & ROMAN IMAGINATION: Nero and the Roman Imagination", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5118/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.19", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "NERO & ROMAN IMAGINATION: Nero and the Roman Imagination", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-131-301", "path": "/courses/5118/sections/301", "id": "5118-301", "aliases": ["CLST-131-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/5118/sections/301/reviews/2424-JAMES-KER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2424-JAMES-KER", "first_name": "JAMES", "last_name": "KER", "id": "2424-JAMES-KER", "name": "JAMES KER"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "5118-301-2424-JAMES-KER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-131", "path": "/courses/5118", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5118/sections", "values": [{"name": "NERO & ROMAN IMAGINATION: Nero and the Roman Imagination", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-131-301", "path": "/courses/5118/sections/301", "id": "5118-301", "aliases": ["CLST-131-301"]}]}, "id": 5118, "aliases": ["CLST-131"]}
