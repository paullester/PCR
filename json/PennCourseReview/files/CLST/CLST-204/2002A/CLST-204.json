{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/278"}, "description": "This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture. We will accomplish this through a comparison of ancient works with popular film. Students will read a number of well-known texts from antiquity, one or two 20th-century works, and view 8-12 (mostly) recent popular films that in some way \"translate\" classical themes, ideas, or methods of narration. We will examine the texts and films first within their cultural contexts and then against one another. This comparative approach will allow us to address a number of different themes, issues, and reading strategies. Topics and films may change slightly from year to year, but some likely themes include: Homer's Odyssey, Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Euripides' Hippolytus, Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, and a number of critical essays. Probable films include: Die Hard, Aliens, Angel Heart, and Mighty Aphrodite. Students should plan to attend weekly screenings in addition to the regularly scheduled course meetings. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "HOLLYWOOD \"CLASSICS\"", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/278/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.16", "rDifficulty": "1.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.59", "rRecommendMajor": "3.72", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.16", "rReadingsValue": "3.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.41", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.59"}, "section": {"name": "HOLLYWOOD \"CLASSICS\"", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-204-401", "path": "/courses/278/sections/401", "id": "278-401", "aliases": ["CLST-204-401", "FILM-204-401", "COML-204-401", "WSTD-202-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/278/sections/401/reviews/260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE", "first_name": "JACQUELINE", "last_name": "SADASHIGE", "id": "260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE", "name": "JACQUELINE SADASHIGE"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "278-401-260-JACQUELINE-SADASHIGE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-204", "path": "/courses/278", "sections": {"path": "/courses/278/sections", "values": [{"name": "HOLLYWOOD \"CLASSICS\"", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-204-401", "path": "/courses/278/sections/401", "id": "278-401", "aliases": ["CLST-204-401", "FILM-204-401", "COML-204-401", "WSTD-202-401"]}]}, "id": 278, "aliases": ["CLST-204", "FILM-204", "COML-204", "WSTD-202"]}
