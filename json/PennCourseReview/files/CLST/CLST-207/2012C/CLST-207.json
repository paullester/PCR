This course surveys the cultural record of those experiences in various media from antiquity to the present. We will consider the city as a center of culture, a den of iniquity, a religious sanctuary, and a political capital as depicted in the works of (among others) Cicero, Fellini, Goethe, Piranesi, Montaigne, Kubrick, Juvenal, Byron, Luther, and Freud. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "VISIONS ROME/ART-LIT-CIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28745/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "VISIONS ROME/ART-LIT-CIN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-207-301", "path": "/courses/28745/sections/301", "id": "28745-301", "aliases": ["CLST-207-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/28745/sections/301/reviews/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "first_name": "JOSEPH A", "last_name": "FARRELL", "id": "263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "name": "JOSEPH A FARRELL"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "28745-301-263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-207", "path": "/courses/28745", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28745/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISIONS ROME/ART-LIT-CIN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-207-301", "path": "/courses/28745/sections/301", "id": "28745-301", "aliases": ["CLST-207-301"]}]}, "id": 28745, "aliases": ["CLST-207"]}
