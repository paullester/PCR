{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4919"}, "description": "What was it like to live in the Roman world? What did that world look, taste and smell like? How did Romans raise their families, entertain themselves, understand death, and interact with their government? What were Roman values and how did they differ from our own? This course takes as its subject the the everyday lives of individuals and explores those lives using the combined tools of archaeology, architecture and art, as well as some primary source readings. In doing so, it seeks to integrate those monuments into a world of real people, and to use archaeology to narrate a story about ancient lives and life habits. Some of the topics explored will include the Roman house, bathing and hygiene, gardens, agriculture and children. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ARCHAEOL OF PRIVATE LIFE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21481/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHAEOL OF PRIVATE LIFE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CLST-252-001", "path": "/courses/21481/sections/001", "id": "21481-001", "aliases": ["CLST-252-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/21481/sections/001/reviews/5323-KIMBERLY-D--BOWES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5323-KIMBERLY-D--BOWES", "first_name": "KIMBERLY D.", "last_name": "BOWES", "id": "5323-KIMBERLY-D--BOWES", "name": "KIMBERLY D.
