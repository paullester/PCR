{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5312"}, "description": "What was a \"philosopher\" in ancient Greece and Rome? How were philosophers viewed by non-philosophers in antiquity? What was the difference between philosophers and sophists? And how do ancient representations of philosophers compare to modern ideas about the position of intellectuals in society? The central figure to be studied will be Socrates, whom we will approach through Plato and Xenophon as well as Aristophanes' Clouds. We will compare and contrast the representations of Socrates with those of other ancient philosophers, through readings that will include parts of Diogenes Laertius' Lives, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. All Greek and Latin texts wil be read in translation. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25828/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-327-301", "path": "/courses/25828/sections/301", "id": "25828-301", "aliases": ["CLST-327-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/25828/sections/301/reviews/1472-EMILY-R--C--WILSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1472-EMILY-R--C--WILSON", "first_name": "EMILY R.
