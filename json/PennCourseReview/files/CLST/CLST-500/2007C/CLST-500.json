{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1757"}, "description": "Introductory graduate proseminar on the study of the ancient Greco-Roman world, for students in the Classical Studies and Ancient History Ph.D. programs. This course encourages and enables students to define and question the boundaries of their discipline, and to explore multiple methods of analyzing antiquity. We will investigate big topics -- such as History, Space, Language, Ritual, Status, Gender and Performance -- from a range of alternate perspectives (considering, for example, how material culture, philology and history might intersect, and might not). A major goal of the course will be to encourage students, at the outset of their scholarly careers, to understand the recursive loop between theory and practice. Requirements will include short writing assignments (around 5pp.), spaced throughout the semester. The course is graded as Satisfactory/ Not Satisfactory. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13055/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "0.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-500-301", "path": "/courses/13055/sections/301", "id": "13055-301", "aliases": ["CLST-500-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/13055/sections/301/reviews/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "MCINERNEY", "id": "84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "name": "JEREMY MCINERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "13055-301-84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-500", "path": "/courses/13055", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13055/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-500-301", "path": "/courses/13055/sections/301", "id": "13055-301", "aliases": ["CLST-500-301"]}]}, "id": 13055, "aliases": ["CLST-500"]}
