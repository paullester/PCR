{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3021"}, "description": "The history of modern medicine as we know it in the West is remarkbly recent; until the nineteenth century prevailing theories of the body and mind, and many therapeutic methods to combat disease, were largely informed by an elaborate system developed centuries earlier in ancient Greece, at a period when the lines between philosophy, medicine, and what we might consider magic, were much less clearly defined than they are today. This course will examine the ways in which the Greeks conceptualized the body, disease, and healing, and will compare these to medical culture of our time. We will consider sources from Hippocrates, Plato, and Aristotle to Galen and Soranus, and whenever possible we will juxtapose these writings with modern discourse about similar topics. Several visitors from the Medical School are expected to participate on a regular basis. All readings will be in English and no previous background in Classical Studies is required. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "GREEK & ROMAN MEDICINE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7492/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.41", "rInstructorAccess": "3.76", "rReadingsValue": "3.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "GREEK & ROMAN MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-371-401", "path": "/courses/7492/sections/401", "id": "7492-401", "aliases": ["CLST-371-401", "HSOC-353-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/7492/sections/401/reviews/262-RALPH-M--ROSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/262-RALPH-M--ROSEN", "first_name": "RALPH M.", "last_name": "ROSEN", "id": "262-RALPH-M--ROSEN", "name": "RALPH M.
