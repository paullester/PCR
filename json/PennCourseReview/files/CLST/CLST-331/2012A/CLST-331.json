{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5396"}, "description": "Homer's Iliad presents a dark and difficult vision of the world, but one that nonetheless inspires. Casual cruelty, divine caprice, and savage violence test heroes and lesser people and provoke a reckoning with the stark realities of both human vulnerability and capability. It inspires a kind of terror, but still also somehow provides a kind of comfort, albeit one whose character seems almost beyond comprehension. By a close and careful reading of Homer's text, along with some reflections and readings drawn from more contemporary wars, including the current ones, we will try to examine these issues with one eye on the past and one on the present. Our goal will be to achieve some further understanding of war and human experience. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ILIAD IN TIME OF WAR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27190/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "3.59", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "3.59", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.24", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "ILIAD IN TIME OF WAR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-331-301", "path": "/courses/27190/sections/301", "id": "27190-301", "aliases": ["CLST-331-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/27190/sections/301/reviews/259-PETER-T--STRUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/259-PETER-T--STRUCK", "first_name": "PETER T.", "last_name": "STRUCK", "id": "259-PETER-T--STRUCK", "name": "PETER T.
