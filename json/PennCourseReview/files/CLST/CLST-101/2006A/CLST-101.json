{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3019"}, "description": "Our self appears to be one of the most evident realities, yet when reflected upon it shows itself to be one of the most difficult to define. The history of western literature offers interesting examples of different ways of constructing the \"self\" through first person narrative. In the course we will analyze the works of three authors that exhibit very diverse approaches to constructing the question of the self: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Augustine's Confessions and Proust's In Search of Lost Time. Marcus Aurelius's Meditations are an example of how the preoccupation of conformity to a philosophical model defines the perception he has of himself: in them the events of his life and his memories find no place. In Augustine's Confessions, instead, a great attention is devoted to personal history and life events as key factors that define who the writer and protagonist of the book is: the Confessions are the story of a life-long dialogue between Augustine and God. In Proust's In Search of Lost Time, however, the absence of both a philosophical model and of God as the transcendent interlocutor, results in the self being seen as a kaleidoscope of memories. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "SPKG&WRTG IN ANC GREECE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7486/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SPKG&WRTG IN ANC GREECE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-101-301", "path": "/courses/7486/sections/301", "id": "7486-301", "aliases": ["CLST-101-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/7486/sections/301/reviews/2897-ALEXANDRA-PAPPAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2897-ALEXANDRA-PAPPAS", "first_name": "ALEXANDRA", "last_name": "PAPPAS", "id": "2897-ALEXANDRA-PAPPAS", "name": "ALEXANDRA PAPPAS"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "7486-301-2897-ALEXANDRA-PAPPAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-101", "path": "/courses/7486", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7486/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPKG&WRTG IN ANC GREECE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-101-301", "path": "/courses/7486/sections/301", "id": "7486-301", "aliases": ["CLST-101-301"]}]}, "id": 7486, "aliases": ["CLST-101"]}
