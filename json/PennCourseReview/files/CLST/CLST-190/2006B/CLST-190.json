{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3537"}, "description": "By the time he died in 323 BC at the age of 33, Alexander had conquered most of the known world and had transformed forever the shape of politics and culture. His legacy is an enduring one, since the year of his death marks a transition from the old Greek city state to what has been called a Hellenistic (i.e. hellenized) world in which, arguably, we are still living. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to this period by examining its history, social organization and beliefs, literature and art. We shall also explore the glamorous myths that have surrounded Alexander from his own day to the present. Our aim will be to separate fact from fiction and to determine the significance of Alexander not only for the fourth century but also for ourselves who have inherited from the world he created certain values and assumptions about politics, art, cultural diversity and diffusion, and the place of human beings in the universe. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "ALEXANDER THE GREAT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9687/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "ALEXANDER THE GREAT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "CLST-190-910", "path": "/courses/9687/sections/910", "id": "9687-910", "aliases": ["CLST-190-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/9687/sections/910/reviews/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "MCINERNEY", "id": "84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "name": "JEREMY MCINERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "9687-910-84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-190", "path": "/courses/9687", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9687/sections", "values": [{"name": "ALEXANDER THE GREAT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "CLST-190-910", "path": "/courses/9687/sections/910", "id": "9687-910", "aliases": ["CLST-190-910"]}, {"name": "ALEXANDER THE GREAT", "sectionnum": "919", "primary_alias": "CLST-190-919", "path": "/courses/9687/sections/919", "id": "9687-919", "aliases": ["CLST-190-919"]}]}, "id": 9687, "aliases": ["CLST-190"]}
