{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5392"}, "description": "This seminar will explore the poetry of Publius Vergilius Maro, better known as Vergil (or Virgil), whom many regard as the greatest of all Roman poets and who is comparable in importance to poets such as Homer, Dante, and Milton. We will read all of Vergil's works in translation along with a selection of the most important commentary on those works from antiquity to the present day. In addition, we will study the impact of Vergil's poetry on other poets (and vice versa). \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "POETRY OF VERGIL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27184/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "POETRY OF VERGIL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-030-301", "path": "/courses/27184/sections/301", "id": "27184-301", "aliases": ["CLST-030-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/27184/sections/301/reviews/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "first_name": "JOSEPH A", "last_name": "FARRELL", "id": "263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "name": "JOSEPH A FARRELL"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "27184-301-263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-030", "path": "/courses/27184", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27184/sections", "values": [{"name": "POETRY OF VERGIL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-030-301", "path": "/courses/27184/sections/301", "id": "27184-301", "aliases": ["CLST-030-301"]}]}, "id": 27184, "aliases": ["CLST-030"]}
