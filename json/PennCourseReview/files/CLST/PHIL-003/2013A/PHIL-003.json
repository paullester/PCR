{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/869"}, "description": "The Birth of Philosophy: What is philosophy? How does it differ from science, religion, literature, and other modes of human discourse? This course traces the origins of philosophy as a discipline in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece and Rome. We will examine how \"natural philosophers\" such as thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus distinguished their inquiries from the teachings of poets such as Homer and Hesiod; how ancient atomism had its origins in a response to Parmenides' challenge to the very assumption that things change in the world; how Socrates reoriented the focus of philosophy away from the natural world and toward the fundamental ethical question, \"how shall I live?\"; how his pupil Plato and subsequently Aristotle developed elaborate philosophical systems that address the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness. Finally, we will examine the ways in which later thinkers such as Epicureans, Stoics, and the neoPlatonists transformed and extended the earlier tradition. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "HIST ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30841/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.93", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rCourseQuality": "2.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorQuality": "2.58", "rCommAbility": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "HIST ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-003-601", "path": "/courses/30841/sections/601", "id": "30841-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-003-601", "CLST-103-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/30841/sections/601/reviews/5509-SAUL-ROSENTHAL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5509-SAUL-ROSENTHAL", "first_name": "SAUL", "last_name": "ROSENTHAL", "id": "5509-SAUL-ROSENTHAL", "name": "SAUL ROSENTHAL"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "30841-601-5509-SAUL-ROSENTHAL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-003", "path": "/courses/30841", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30841/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-003-601", "path": "/courses/30841/sections/601", "id": "30841-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-003-601", "CLST-103-601"]}]}, "id": 30841, "aliases": ["PHIL-003", "CLST-103"]}
