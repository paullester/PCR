{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4918"}, "description": "The principate of Augustus is one of history's most decisive turning points, inthat it brought about the transformation of the Roman Republic into an Empire. This political revolution depended on a cultural one, and Augustus used literary and artistic production not just as media of communication for the dissemination of favorable propaganda, but as a means of refashioning Roman culture. The result was that fundamental changes were made to seem natural and inevitable even as almost every aspect of political, social, and cultural life were decisively transformed. This course examines the phenomenon by considering closely the history and the literary and artistic production of of the period. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "AUGUSTAN CULTRL REVOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21480/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "AUGUSTAN CULTRL REVOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CLST-218-001", "path": "/courses/21480/sections/001", "id": "21480-001", "aliases": ["CLST-218-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/21480/sections/001/reviews/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "first_name": "JOSEPH A", "last_name": "FARRELL", "id": "263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "name": "JOSEPH A FARRELL"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "21480-001-263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-218", "path": "/courses/21480", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21480/sections", "values": [{"name": "AUGUSTAN CULTRL REVOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CLST-218-001", "path": "/courses/21480/sections/001", "id": "21480-001", "aliases": ["CLST-218-001"]}]}, "id": 21480, "aliases": ["CLST-218"]}
