How do we build software systems and components that scale to millions of users and petabytes of data, and are \"always available\"? In the modern Internet, virtually all large Web services run atop multiple geographically distributed data centers: Google, Yahoo, Facebook, iTunes, Amazon, eBay, Bing, Services must scale across thousands of machines, tolerate faults, and support of concurrent requests. Increasingly, the major providers (including Amazon, GoMicrosoft, HP, and IBM) are looking at \"hosting\" third-party applications in their data centers - forming so-called \"cloud computing\" services. A significant number of these services also process \"streaming\" data: geocoding information from cell phones, tweets, streaming video, etc. This course, aimed at a sophomore with exposure to basic programming within the context of a single machine, focuses on the issues and programming models related to such cloud and distributed data processing technologies: data partitioning, storage schemes, stream processing, and \"mostly shared-nothing\" parallel algorithms. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SCALABLE & CLOUD COMP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29300/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rTAQuality": "2.78", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.03", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.94", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.16"}, "section": {"name": "SCALABLE & CLOUD COMP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKSE-212-001", "path": "/courses/29300/sections/001", "id": "29300-001", "aliases": ["MKSE-212-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/29300/sections/001/reviews/5319-ANDREAS-HAEBERLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5319-ANDREAS-HAEBERLEN", "first_name": "ANDREAS", "last_name": "HAEBERLEN", "id": "5319-ANDREAS-HAEBERLEN", "name": "ANDREAS HAEBERLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "29300-001-5319-ANDREAS-HAEBERLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKSE-212", "path": "/courses/29300", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29300/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCALABLE & CLOUD COMP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKSE-212-001", "path": "/courses/29300/sections/001", "id": "29300-001", "aliases": ["MKSE-212-001"]}]}, "id": 29300, "aliases": ["MKSE-212"]}
