Students believed that many of the class topics could\r\nhave been better explained in terms of quantitative descriptions, but instead were\r\nconveyed through \u201csomewhat oversimplified non-quantitative terms.\u201d The material of\r\nthe course interested many students, and the interactive experiments and demos were a\r\nfavorite of many.\r\nProfessor Kearns was seen as a great professor, but some students wished that he\r\nkept his notes and class readings more organized and gave more incentive for students to\r\ngo to class.\r\nThe class relied on two homework assignments, a midterm, and a final to produce\r\na final grade for the class, which some students saw as being unfair. The tests were much\r\nharder than the homework and class lectures led students to believe, and the grading of\r\nthe course disappointed many students.", "num_students": 88, "path": "/courses/24765/sections/001/reviews/1356-MICHAEL-J--KEARNS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1356-MICHAEL-J--KEARNS", "first_name": "MICHAEL J.", "last_name": "KEARNS", "id": "1356-MICHAEL-J--KEARNS", "name": "MICHAEL J.
