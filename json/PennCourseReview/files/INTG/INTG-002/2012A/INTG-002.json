Students examined how people's understandings of the shape of the world are important to their own conceptions of human nature. The course consisted of four main parts. One each was in Political Science, Comparative Literature, and Physics, in which experts in their fields will guide a broad introduction to what their discipline can offer to the topic of the Order of Things. These three parts proceeded by large lectures and intimate discussions and had readings and assignments of their own. In a fourth part of the class, students explored their own attempts to make sense of these broader questions, using what they learned in their individual streams. Assignments consisted of a variety of readings, papers, problem sets, and projects, all designed to help students explore both the individual parts of the course and the ways in which they fit together. Readings included works by Aristotle, Milton, Locke, Bacon, Newton, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Hegel, Marx, Darwin, and Einstein.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, students were less satisfied with this semester of the Integrated Studies Program (ISP) than their previous semester. Students felt that the program on the whole \"is a great idea but poorly executed.\" Some enjoyed it, calling it an \"excellent and valuable experience.\" Most class members, however, were frustrated by the lack of a \"unifying theme to drive the course.\" Some program members found the political science stream disorganized, with \"some of the readings about politics, while others seemed unrelated.\" Other students expressed discontent with the intense focus on only Milton's Paradise Lost in the literature stream.

It examines how peoples' understandings of the shape of the world are important to their own conceptions of human nature. These ways of understanding the larger cosmos might emerge from the idea that abstract laws guide all things and all human societies. They might posit that the internal characters of individual parts have their own shaping power on the structures of the whole. They might also rest on this or that hypothesis of transcendence as an ultimate source of the order of things, large and small.  The course consists of four main parts. One each is in Political Science, Comparative Literature, and Physics, in which experts in their fields guide a broad introduction to what their discipline can offer to the topic of The Order of Things. These three parts are constituent of large lectures and intimate discussion. They each have readings and assignments of their own. In a fourth part of the class, students will explore their own attempts to make sense of these broader questions, using what they have learned in the individual streams.\r\nA significant amount of students found the course to be less enjoyable than it\u2019s first-semester counterpart.  One student summed up the course as \u201can excellent and valuable experience,\u201d but felt the work required \u201cconsumed [the student\u2019s] first year.\u201d  Professor Wilson\u2019s Literature stream was dominated heavily by grammar and syntax.  Overall, students felt the course\u2019s attempt to mesh three different disciplines was \u201ca good idea, but poorly executed.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students found Professor Wilson to be very knowledgeable about the material, but felt Professor Wilson had trouble communicating it effectively.  Students overwhelmingly found Professor Wilson\u2019s lectures to be difficult to understand and take notes on due to the very fast pace of the lecturing.  Furthermore, many students craved significantly more guidance on what was expected of them on the assignments.  \r\n\r\nAssignments consist of a variety of readings, papers, problem sets, and projects that are designed to help students explore both the individual parts of the course and the ways in which they fit together.
