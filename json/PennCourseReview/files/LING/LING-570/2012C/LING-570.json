{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5558"}, "description": "The generative literature on language acquisition has produced many accurate and insightful descriptions of child language, but relatively few explicit accounts of learning that incorporate the role of individual experience into the knowledge of specific languages. Likewise, the experimental approach to language development has identified processes that could provide the bridge between the data and the grammar, but questions remain whether laboratory findings can sufficiently generalize to the full range of linguistic complexity. This course is an overview of research in language acquisition with particular focus on the important connection between what children know and how they come to know it. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29206/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-570-301", "path": "/courses/29206/sections/301", "id": "29206-301", "aliases": ["LING-570-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/29206/sections/301/reviews/3353-CHARLES-YANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3353-CHARLES-YANG", "first_name": "CHARLES", "last_name": "YANG", "id": "3353-CHARLES-YANG", "name": "CHARLES YANG"}, "num_reviewers": 1, "id": "29206-301-3353-CHARLES-YANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-570", "path": "/courses/29206", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29206/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-570-301", "path": "/courses/29206/sections/301", "id": "29206-301", "aliases": ["LING-570-301"]}]}, "id": 29206, "aliases": ["LING-570"]}
