{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/686"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to current syntactic theory, covering the principles that govern phrase structure (the composition of phrases and sentences), movement (dependencies between syntactic constituents), and binding (the interpretation of different types of noun phrases). Although much of the evidence discussed in the class will come from English, evidence from other languages will also play an important role, in keeping with the comparative and universalist perspective of modern syntactic theory. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO SYNTAX", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1854/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "3.18", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.65", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO SYNTAX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-150-001", "path": "/courses/1854/sections/001", "id": "1854-001", "aliases": ["LING-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/1854/sections/001/reviews/734-BEATRICE-SANTORINI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/734-BEATRICE-SANTORINI", "first_name": "BEATRICE", "last_name": "SANTORINI", "id": "734-BEATRICE-SANTORINI", "name": "BEATRICE SANTORINI"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "1854-001-734-BEATRICE-SANTORINI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-150", "path": "/courses/1854", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1854/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRODUCTION TO SYNTAX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-150-001", "path": "/courses/1854/sections/001", "id": "1854-001", "aliases": ["LING-150-001"]}]}, "id": 1854, "aliases": ["LING-150"]}
