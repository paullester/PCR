{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4073"}, "description": "This course introduces the tools, techniques, as well as current research on the approach to language as a dynamical system, which seeks to fruitfully integrate linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics, and historical linguistics through the means of mathematical modeling. Topics include: string processing, dynamical systems and stability, stochastic processes, mathematical models of population dynamics, and dynamical models of language learning, processing, and change. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "DYNAMICS OF LANGUAGE: LEARNING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16016/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "DYNAMICS OF LANGUAGE: LEARNING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-506-301", "path": "/courses/16016/sections/301", "id": "16016-301", "aliases": ["LING-506-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/16016/sections/301/reviews/3353-CHARLES-YANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3353-CHARLES-YANG", "first_name": "CHARLES", "last_name": "YANG", "id": "3353-CHARLES-YANG", "name": "CHARLES YANG"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "16016-301-3353-CHARLES-YANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-506", "path": "/courses/16016", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16016/sections", "values": [{"name": "DYNAMICS OF LANGUAGE: LEARNING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-506-301", "path": "/courses/16016/sections/301", "id": "16016-301", "aliases": ["LING-506-301"]}]}, "id": 16016, "aliases": ["LING-506"]}
