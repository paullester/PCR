{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4828"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to game-theoretic pragmatics. It focuses on aspects of meaning that follow from rational, strategic decision making. The course covers an introduction to the theory of games with an emphasis on coordination games and cooperation. We develop a game theoretic account of truth conditional semantics using zero-sum games. We then cover Gricean implicature; focal points and coordination; polysemy vs homophony; and a game account of reference tracking and pronoun interpretation. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "LANGUAGE AND GAME THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21977/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.52", "rDifficulty": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.81", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.73", "rWorkRequired": "0.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.05", "rInstructorQuality": "3.14"}, "section": {"name": "LANGUAGE AND GAME THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-354-001", "path": "/courses/21977/sections/001", "id": "21977-001", "aliases": ["LING-354-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/21977/sections/001/reviews/723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "first_name": "ROBIN L.", "last_name": "CLARK", "id": "723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "name": "ROBIN L.
