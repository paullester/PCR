{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1390"}, "description": "This course aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to use computational techniques to facilitate linguistic research. It introduces the computer representation of linguistic data, the construction of linguistic databases, ways of searching for and extracting information of interest, and ways of generating useful displays of the results. Topics covered include the representation of text on computers (multilingual character encoding, mark-up schemes, means of converting among representations); regular expressions and their use in searching; context free grammars; basic parsing techniques; properties and uses of databases; approaches to annotation; and sorting as a tool for searching and organizing data. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "COMP METHODS LING RESRCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5542/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "COMP METHODS LING RESRCH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-538-301", "path": "/courses/5542/sections/301", "id": "5542-301", "aliases": ["LING-538-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/5542/sections/301/reviews/737-WILLIAM-POSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/737-WILLIAM-POSER", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "POSER", "id": "737-WILLIAM-POSER", "name": "WILLIAM POSER"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "5542-301-737-WILLIAM-POSER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-538", "path": "/courses/5542", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5542/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP METHODS LING RESRCH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-538-301", "path": "/courses/5542/sections/301", "id": "5542-301", "aliases": ["LING-538-301"]}]}, "id": 5542, "aliases": ["LING-538"]}
