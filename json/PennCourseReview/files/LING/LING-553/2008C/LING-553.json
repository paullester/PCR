{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1391"}, "description": "Linguistics 553 will cover those elements of logic that are fundamental to semantic theory. The course will treat basic set theory, propositional logic (formulas, truth-functional connectives, truth tables), predicate logic (quantification, interpretation relative to a model) and natural inference. Given these foundations, we will then cover intensional logic and type theory. The formal discussion will be highlighted with semantic treatments of some natural language phenomena (Montague's analysis of a fragment of English, definite descriptions, generalized quantifiers, reference in opaque contexts, perception verbs). \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "FORMAL SEMANTICS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18916/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-553", "path": "/courses/18916", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18916/sections", "values": [{"name": "FORMAL SEMANTICS I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-553-001", "path": "/courses/18916/sections/001", "id": "18916-001", "aliases": ["LING-553-001"]}]}, "id": 18916, "aliases": ["LING-553"]}
