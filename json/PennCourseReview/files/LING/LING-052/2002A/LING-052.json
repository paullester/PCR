{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/678"}, "description": "Big, fast, cheap computers; ubiquitous digital networks; huge and growing archives of text and speech; improving algorithms for automatic analysis of text and speech: all of this creates a cornucopia of research opportunities, at every level of linguistic analysis from phonetics to pragmatics, and in applications from linguistic science to information extraction and sentiment analysis.
