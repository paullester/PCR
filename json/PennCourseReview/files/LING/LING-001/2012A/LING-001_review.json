Intended for any undergraduate interested in language or its use, this course is also recommended as an introduction for students who plan to major in linguistics.\r\n\r\nOverall, the students commented that the course quality could be improved. For example, although the \u201ccourse content is very interesting,\u201d \u201cthe lectures were not so productive and the homeworks were quite ambiguous.\u201d One student said that he or she \u201cwish[ed] that the midterm/final corresponded more with the homeworks, both in terms of content, the types of questions, and the format.\u201d However, the course \u201cprovides a great understanding of the basics of language.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students mentioned that they found it rather confusing to have two professors alternating in their teaching of the class. The students stated that Professor Legate and Professor Yang \u201cwere both great.\u201d However, one student mentioned that \u201cProfessor Yang struggled with getting students interested in the material and successfully communicating the information to them.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral students commented on the ambiguity of the homework and that there was little correlation between the homework and the midterm and final exams. There is \u201ca lot of memorization required.\u201d Students mentioned that this course would be interesting for a non-major but not necessary. This course fulfills the Natural Science and Mathematics sector. There are no prerequisites for this course.
