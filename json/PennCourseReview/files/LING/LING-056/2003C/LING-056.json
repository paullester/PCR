{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2336"}, "description": "In this seminar we will explore many facets of word meaning, beginning with the differences between dictionaries and then opening up our explorations to the sorts of properties of words that dictionaries don't tell us about, such as speech acts, argument structure, and verbal alternations. We'll pay particular attention to the \"Aristotle-Vendler\" system of classifying verbs into different aspectual classes and look at the evidence and controversies around those classes. Finally, we'll look at how some contemporary work in lexical semantics, such as the Word Net project, has applications in computational projects, particularly in the building of specialized and general search engines. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "WORDS, WORDS, WORDS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4341/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "1.87", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.93", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "2.93"}, "section": {"name": "WORDS, WORDS, WORDS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-056-301", "path": "/courses/4341/sections/301", "id": "4341-301", "aliases": ["LING-056-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/4341/sections/301/reviews/2195-CHRISTINE-BRISSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2195-CHRISTINE-BRISSON", "first_name": "CHRISTINE", "last_name": "BRISSON", "id": "2195-CHRISTINE-BRISSON", "name": "CHRISTINE BRISSON"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "4341-301-2195-CHRISTINE-BRISSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-056", "path": "/courses/4341", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4341/sections", "values": [{"name": "WORDS, WORDS, WORDS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-056-301", "path": "/courses/4341/sections/301", "id": "4341-301", "aliases": ["LING-056-301"]}]}, "id": 4341, "aliases": ["LING-056"]}
