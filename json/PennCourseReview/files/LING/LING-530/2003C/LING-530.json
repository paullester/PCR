{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1967"}, "description": "First half of a year-long introduction to the formal study of phonology. Basic concepts in articulatory phonetics; the distribution of sounds (phonemes and allophones); underlying and surface forms, and how to relate them using both ordered-rule and surface-constraint approaches. The survey of theoretical topics in this term includes distinctive features (context, organization, underspecification); the autosegmental representation of tone; and the theory of phonological domains and their interaction with morphological and syntactic constituency. Emphasizes hands-on analysis of a wide range of data. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PHONOLOGY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4356/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-530", "path": "/courses/4356", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4356/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHONOLOGY I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-530-001", "path": "/courses/4356/sections/001", "id": "4356-001", "aliases": ["LING-530-001"]}]}, "id": 4356, "aliases": ["LING-530"]}
