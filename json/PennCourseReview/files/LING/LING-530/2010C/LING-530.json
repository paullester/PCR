{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1967"}, "description": "First half of a year-long introduction to the formal study of phonology. Basic concepts in articulatory phonetics; the distribution of sounds (phonemes and allophones); underlying and surface forms, and how to relate them using both ordered-rule and surface-constraint approaches. The survey of theoretical topics in this term includes distinctive features (context, organization, underspecification); the autosegmental representation of tone; and the theory of phonological domains and their interaction with morphological and syntactic constituency. Emphasizes hands-on analysis of a wide range of data. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PHONOLOGY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23339/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PHONOLOGY I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-530-001", "path": "/courses/23339/sections/001", "id": "23339-001", "aliases": ["LING-530-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/23339/sections/001/reviews/735-ROLF-NOYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/735-ROLF-NOYER", "first_name": "ROLF", "last_name": "NOYER", "id": "735-ROLF-NOYER", "name": "ROLF NOYER"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "23339-001-735-ROLF-NOYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-530", "path": "/courses/23339", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23339/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHONOLOGY I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-530-001", "path": "/courses/23339/sections/001", "id": "23339-001", "aliases": ["LING-530-001"]}]}, "id": 23339, "aliases": ["LING-530"]}
