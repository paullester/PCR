{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/695"}, "description": "This course covers the fundamentals of proof theory and logic as they apply to linguistics. The notion of a well-formed derivation is fundamental to all flavors of formal linguistics and all sub-disciplines of linguistics-phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. It rests, ultimately, on axiomatic systems developed by logicians to encode the process of valid formal reasoning. We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and, where appropriate, develop connections with parsing theory, automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting, we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning, theorem proving, dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I). It includes a review of the propositional and predicate calculus before introducing tableaux and resolution systems, unification, axiomatic systems, natural deduction and sequent calculi. The latter two systems are particularly relevant for grammar formalisms like phrase structure grammars, TAGs and Categorial Grammar. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3187/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-548-301", "path": "/courses/3187/sections/301", "id": "3187-301", "aliases": ["LING-548-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/3187/sections/301/reviews/723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "first_name": "ROBIN L.", "last_name": "CLARK", "id": "723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "name": "ROBIN L.
