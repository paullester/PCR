{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4985"}, "description": "The first part of the course expands the system from LING 580 to include intensional contexts. In particular, we discuss analyses of modals, attitude verbs, and conditionals, as well as the scope of noun phrases in modal environments. The second part of the course discusses a selection of topics from current work in semantics, such as the semantics of questions, tense and aspect, donkey anaphora, indefinites, genericity, degree constructions, events and situations, domain restriction, plurality and focus. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "SEMANTICS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26321/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "SEMANTICS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-581-001", "path": "/courses/26321/sections/001", "id": "26321-001", "aliases": ["LING-581-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/26321/sections/001/reviews/4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ", "first_name": "FLORIAN", "last_name": "SCHWARZ", "id": "4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ", "name": "FLORIAN SCHWARZ"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "26321-001-4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-581", "path": "/courses/26321", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26321/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEMANTICS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-581-001", "path": "/courses/26321/sections/001", "id": "26321-001", "aliases": ["LING-581-001"]}]}, "id": 26321, "aliases": ["LING-581"]}
