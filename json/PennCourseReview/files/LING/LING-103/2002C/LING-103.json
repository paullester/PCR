{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1959"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to explore the relationship between linguistic structure and the use of language for artistic purposes. The syllabus is organized as a sequence of units, each built around a particular theme. These include the sound structure of poetry (meter, rhyme, and other linguistic patterns in Jabberwocky, the Odyssey, Shakespeare, the Troubadours, and others); how precise linguistic data can be used to solve an outstanding literary problem (determining the approximate date when Beowulf was composed); and the structure of folktales of various cultures and of narratives of everyday experience. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "LANG STRUCT & VERBAL ART", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3173/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.52", "rDifficulty": "1.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "1.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.95"}, "section": {"name": "LANG STRUCT & VERBAL ART", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-103-001", "path": "/courses/3173/sections/001", "id": "3173-001", "aliases": ["LING-103-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/3173/sections/001/reviews/735-ROLF-NOYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/735-ROLF-NOYER", "first_name": "ROLF", "last_name": "NOYER", "id": "735-ROLF-NOYER", "name": "ROLF NOYER"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "3173-001-735-ROLF-NOYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-103", "path": "/courses/3173", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3173/sections", "values": [{"name": "LANG STRUCT & VERBAL ART", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-103-001", "path": "/courses/3173/sections/001", "id": "3173-001", "aliases": ["LING-103-001"]}]}, "id": 3173, "aliases": ["LING-103"]}
