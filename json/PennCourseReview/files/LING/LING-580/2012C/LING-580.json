{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5559"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to formal semantics for natural language. The main aim is to develop a semantic system that provides a compositional interpretation of natural language sentences. We discuss various of the aspects central to meaning composition, including function application, modification, quantification, and binding, as well as issues in the syntax-semantics interface. The basic formal tools relevant for semantic analysis, including set theory, propositional logic, and predicate logic are also introduced. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SEMANTICS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29207/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "SEMANTICS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LING-580-401", "path": "/courses/29207/sections/401", "id": "29207-401", "aliases": ["LING-580-401", "LING-380-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/29207/sections/401/reviews/4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ", "first_name": "FLORIAN", "last_name": "SCHWARZ", "id": "4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ", "name": "FLORIAN SCHWARZ"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "29207-401-4866-FLORIAN-SCHWARZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-580", "path": "/courses/29207", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29207/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEMANTICS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LING-580-401", "path": "/courses/29207/sections/401", "id": "29207-401", "aliases": ["LING-580-401", "LING-380-401"]}]}, "id": 29207, "aliases": ["LING-580", "LING-380"]}
