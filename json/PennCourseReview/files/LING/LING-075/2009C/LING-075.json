{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3437"}, "description": "This is an advanced ASL course in which students expand their conversational and narrative range. While receptive readiness activities continue to be an important part of the class, the emphasis moves toward honing expressive sign skills through narrative presentation and ASL-only class discussions. Various aspects of Deaf culture and cultural behavior rules will be incorporated into the course. A large component of the course is a unit on Deaf history in which students read and discuss major events and famous deaf people via readings, film, class lectures and discussions, and other outside resources. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "AMER SIGN LANGUAGE V", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17610/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.83", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.50", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.67", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rInstructorConcern": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rGradeFairness": "3.33", "rArticulateGoals": "3.17", "rOralSkills": "3.67", "rNativeAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "0.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rInstructorEffective": "3.67", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "AMER SIGN LANGUAGE V", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "LING-075-680", "path": "/courses/17610/sections/680", "id": "17610-680", "aliases": ["LING-075-680"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/17610/sections/680/reviews/3035-JAMI-N--FISHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3035-JAMI-N--FISHER", "first_name": "JAMI N.", "last_name": "FISHER", "id": "3035-JAMI-N--FISHER", "name": "JAMI N.
