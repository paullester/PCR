{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/691"}, "description": "This course takes a detailed look at a number of central topics in morphological theory. The material examined in the course consists of primary readings and reviews, covering a number of central topics in the field. These topics include (but are not restricted to) allomorphy, blocking, the interface of phonology and morphology, syncretism, affixation, the syntax-morphology interface, and compounding. The primary requirements for the class involve short assignments that are based on the readings, in the form of both problem sets and critical appraisals of core theoretical positions. In addition to this, students will write a short paper at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "MORPHOLOGY THEORY II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27688/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.50", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MORPHOLOGY THEORY II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-405-301", "path": "/courses/27688/sections/301", "id": "27688-301", "aliases": ["LING-405-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/27688/sections/301/reviews/724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "first_name": "DAVID S.", "last_name": "EMBICK", "id": "724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "name": "DAVID S.
