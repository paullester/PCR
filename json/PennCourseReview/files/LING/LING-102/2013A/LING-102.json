{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/680"}, "description": "Human language viewed from a social and historical perspective. Students will acquire the tools of linguistic analysis through interactive computer programs, covering phonetics, phonology and morphology, in English and other languages. These techniques will then be used to trace social differences in the use of language, and changing patterns of social stratification. The course will focus on linguistic changes in progress in American society, in both mainstream and minority communities, and the social problems associated with them. Students will engage in field projects to search for the social correlates of linguistic behavior, and use quantitative methods to analyze the results. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO TO SOCIOLING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30556/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.58", "rTAQuality": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "2.79", "rCourseQuality": "2.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.68", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO SOCIOLING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-102-001", "path": "/courses/30556/sections/001", "id": "30556-001", "aliases": ["LING-102-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/30556/sections/001/reviews/4661-AARON-J--DINKIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4661-AARON-J--DINKIN", "first_name": "AARON J.", "last_name": "DINKIN", "id": "4661-AARON-J--DINKIN", "name": "AARON J.
