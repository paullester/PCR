This course was comprised of both quantitative and qualitative components, combining study of lecture and textbook material and analysis of numerical data. The two components were combined in three field assignments, which students heavily praised, with many describing them as \u201cfun\u201d and as their \u201cfavorite part of the course.\u201d The quantitative aspect was simplified and taken slowly, but most students did not feel that the easiness of the class detracted from its interestingness. One student regretted that there wasn\u2019t more time for \u201cin-depth looks at the material\u201d or for \u201cbranching out and looking at other questions in sociolinguistics\u201d because so much time was spent on teaching quantitative analysis skills. However, students appreciated that the course included an exploration of linguistic issues in languages other than English, uncommon for the typical Penn linguistics course. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students\u2019 impressions of Professor Sankoff were predominantly positive. She was described as an \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d lecturer; however, students\u2019 chief complaint was that her PowerPoints were often \u201cfrustratingly disorganized\u201d and therefore \u201cconfusing.\u201d Several students complained that Professor Sankoff was constantly correcting errors in her slides, which consumed a lot of class time. Her classes are very lecture-driven, but students commented that a lot of self-study is also necessary for success in the course. Students overwhelmingly agreed that Professor Sankoff is extremely \u201capproachable,\u201d open to helping students, and \u201cgenuinely cares about her students\u201d and their success. Students also agreed that she was \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d \u201cpassionate,\u201d and an \u201cexpert in the field\u201d of sociolinguistics. Students appreciated that Professor Sankoff incorporated personal or funny anecdotes in her lectures.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;This course was taken by both majors and non-majors and was received positively by both type of student. It fulfills the Quantitative Data Analysis requirement. One Linguistics major noted that the material covered was \u201cimportant\u201d for majors to learn before proceeding further into Linguistics. Students commented that the course was an \u201ceasy way\u201d for students who are \u201cbad with numbers\u201d to fulfill their quantitative data analysis requirement; students who were mathematically minded or were familiar with statistical methods found this class extremely easy but still interesting. Students were assigned three field assignments, which they found to be both \u201cfun and interesting.\u201d Both the midterm and final were described as \u201cunchallenging,\u201d and the work required for the course is \u201cminimal.\u201d", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/21972/sections/001/reviews/736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF", "first_name": "GILLIAN E", "last_name": "SANKOFF", "id": "736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF", "name": "GILLIAN E SANKOFF"}, "num_reviewers": 72, "id": "21972-001-736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-102", "path": "/courses/21972", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21972/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO SOCIOLING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-102-001", "path": "/courses/21972/sections/001", "id": "21972-001", "aliases": ["LING-102-001"]}]}, "id": 21972, "aliases": ["LING-102"]}
