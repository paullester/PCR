{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3765"}, "description": "This course will explore some issues concerning the internal structure of words. After a brief introduction to some basic terms and concepts, we will discuss the interaction of morphology with phonology. We will look both at how morphology conditions phonological rules and how phonology conditions morphology. Then we will turn to the interaction of syntax and morphology. We will look at some problems raised by inflectional morphology, clitics and compounds. The main requirement for the class will be a series of homework exercises in morphological analysis and a short paper at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MORPHOLOGICAL THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23335/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "MORPHOLOGICAL THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-404-001", "path": "/courses/23335/sections/001", "id": "23335-001", "aliases": ["LING-404-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/23335/sections/001/reviews/724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "first_name": "DAVID S.", "last_name": "EMBICK", "id": "724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "name": "DAVID S.
