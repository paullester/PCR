{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4602"}, "description": "This course introduces the tools, techniques, as well as current research on the approach to language as a dynamical system, which seeks to fruitfully integrate linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics, and historical linguistics through the means of mathematical modeling. Topics include: string processing, dynamical systems and stability, stochastic processes, mathematical models of population dynamics, and dynamical models of language learning, processing, and change. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "DYNAMICS OF LANGUAGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27692/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "DYNAMICS OF LANGUAGE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-515-301", "path": "/courses/27692/sections/301", "id": "27692-301", "aliases": ["LING-515-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/27692/sections/301/reviews/3353-CHARLES-YANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3353-CHARLES-YANG", "first_name": "CHARLES", "last_name": "YANG", "id": "3353-CHARLES-YANG", "name": "CHARLES YANG"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "27692-301-3353-CHARLES-YANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-515", "path": "/courses/27692", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27692/sections", "values": [{"name": "DYNAMICS OF LANGUAGE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-515-301", "path": "/courses/27692/sections/301", "id": "27692-301", "aliases": ["LING-515-301"]}]}, "id": 27692, "aliases": ["LING-515"]}
