{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2125"}, "description": "This course examines the sociolinguistic context of modern multilingual states and the impact of their linguistic policies on the cultural identity of linguistic minorities. In the United States, the history of multilingualism will be examined, tracing the growth of linguistic assimilationism and the rebirth of assertive bilingualism, controversies surrounding intelligence and multilingualism, as well as attitudes toward language loyalty and ethno-linguistic identity in various societies. Special cultural factors such as the role of religion, immigrational recency, literacy, socio-economic status, race, educational level, and ethnic pride will be surveyed in terms of their impact on maintenance and/or assimilation. Students will undertake a term project examining some aspect of the above topics in a real or historical community of their preference. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "LANGUAGE POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4704/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "1.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "LANGUAGE POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-543-401", "path": "/courses/4704/sections/401", "id": "4704-401", "aliases": ["SARS-543-401", "LING-540-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/4704/sections/401/reviews/1549-HAROLD-F--SCHIFFMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1549-HAROLD-F--SCHIFFMAN", "first_name": "HAROLD F.", "last_name": "SCHIFFMAN", "id": "1549-HAROLD-F--SCHIFFMAN", "name": "HAROLD F.
