{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5135"}, "description": "A great deal of linguistic meaning can be explained if we conceive of language as being a signaling system used by rational agents. Game theory provides an explicit mathematical account of rational, strategic interaction. This course will lay out the fundamentals of game theory, evolutionary game theory and multi-agent systems necessary to develop a theory of \"radical pragmatics.\" We will discuss game theoretic models of implicature; presuppostion and accomodation; reference tracking; scalar implicature as well as a number of other phenomena. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "GAME THEORETIC PRAGMATIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24681/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "0.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "0.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "GAME THEORETIC PRAGMATIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LING-595-001", "path": "/courses/24681/sections/001", "id": "24681-001", "aliases": ["LING-595-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/24681/sections/001/reviews/723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "first_name": "ROBIN L.", "last_name": "CLARK", "id": "723-ROBIN-L--CLARK", "name": "ROBIN L.
