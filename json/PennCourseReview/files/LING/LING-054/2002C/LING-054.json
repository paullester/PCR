{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1957"}, "description": "This course takes a historical approach to tracing (and reconstructing) the nature of language contacts and bilingualism, over the course of human history. Contacts between groups of people speaking different languages, motivated by trade, migration, conquest and intermarriage, are documented from earliest records. At the same time, differences in socio-historical context have created different kinds of linguistic outcomes. Some languages have been completely lost; new languages have been created. In still other cases, the nature and structure of language has been radically altered. The course introduces the basics of linguistic structure through a discussion of which aspects of language have proved to be relatively stable, and which are readily altered, under conditions of bilingualism. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "BILINGUALISM IN HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3171/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "1.44", "rStimulateInterest": "2.22", "rRecommendMajor": "2.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.72", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "BILINGUALISM IN HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-054-301", "path": "/courses/3171/sections/301", "id": "3171-301", "aliases": ["LING-054-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/3171/sections/301/reviews/736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF", "first_name": "GILLIAN E", "last_name": "SANKOFF", "id": "736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF", "name": "GILLIAN E SANKOFF"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "3171-301-736-GILLIAN-E-SANKOFF"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-054", "path": "/courses/3171", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3171/sections", "values": [{"name": "BILINGUALISM IN HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-054-301", "path": "/courses/3171/sections/301", "id": "3171-301", "aliases": ["LING-054-301"]}]}, "id": 3171, "aliases": ["LING-054"]}
