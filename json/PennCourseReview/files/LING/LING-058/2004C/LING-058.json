{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/679"}, "description": "Because of its apparently species-specific nature, language is central to the study of the human mind. We will pursue an interdisciplinary approach to such questions in this course, moving from the structures of language as revealed by linguistic theory to connections with a number of related fields that are broadly referred to as the \"cognitive sciences\". A number of specific topics will be addressed from these related fields. The structures of language and its role in human cognition will be set against the background of animal communication systems. We will examine the question of how children acquire extremely complex linguistic systems without explicit instruction, drawing on psychological work on the language abilities of children. Additional attention will be focused on the question of how language is represented and computed in the brain, and, correspondingly, how this is studied with brain-imaging techniques. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "LANGUAGE AND COGNITION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5523/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.07", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "LANGUAGE AND COGNITION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LING-058-301", "path": "/courses/5523/sections/301", "id": "5523-301", "aliases": ["LING-058-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/5523/sections/301/reviews/724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "first_name": "DAVID S.", "last_name": "EMBICK", "id": "724-DAVID-S--EMBICK", "name": "DAVID S.
