The systematic regularity of change, the reasons for that regularity, and the exploitation of regularity in linguistic reconstruction are especially emphasized. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of languages, both familiar and unfamiliar. Since there are no prerequisites, the course includes mini-introductions to articulatory phonetics, basic phonology (especially the principle of contrast), and basic morphology (especially inflection), all of which must be understood in order to understand the ways in which they change.\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that the course was \u201cexcellent,\u201d with one student remarking that they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have missed [the] class for the world.\u201d A couple of students remarked that \u201cclass [could] be boring at times,\u201d but that this was only the case because of the subject matter, which was \u201cpossibly the driest facet of linguistics.\u201d In general, students thought that \u201canyone can enjoy this class,\u201d but that \u201cprevious Linguistics knowledge\u201d would be helpful. \r\n\r\nStudents were overwhelmingly impressed by Professor Ringe, oftentimes praising him as \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201ccompelling,\u201d and \u201cincredibly knowledgeable.\u201d They appreciated his ability to make a potentially \u201ctedious\u201d subject very interesting by being \u201ca good storyteller\u201d who \u201ckept [their] attention.\u201d One student noted that \u201cthe hearty demeanor of the professor was inviting\u201d and that the student \u201cfelt at ease to discuss the course\u201d with Professor Ringe after class.\r\n\r\nWhile handouts were reported to be \u201chigh quality,\u201d there were \u201ca lot of them\u201d and some students thought that Professor Ringe used \u201cway too much paper.\u201d Despite the high volume of handouts, students did not report feeling overwhelmed by reading, instead noting that Professor Ringe allowed them to \u201cfocus on learning the material\u201d without \u201cweighing too heavily on homework or exams,\u201d and that the class was generally \u201cnot very demanding\u201d in terms of workload", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/26309/sections/001/reviews/728-DONALD-A--RINGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/728-DONALD-A--RINGE", "first_name": "DONALD A.", "last_name": "RINGE", "id": "728-DONALD-A--RINGE", "name": "DONALD A.
