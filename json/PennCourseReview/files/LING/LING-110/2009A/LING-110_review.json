The systematic regularity of change, the reasons for that regularity, and the exploitation of regularity in linguistic reconstruction are especially emphasized. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of languages, both familiar and unfamiliar. Since there are no prerequisites, the course includes brief introductions to basic linguistics studies such as phonetics, phonology, and morphology.\r\nStudents commented that the course demonstrated an \u201cexcellent balance of in depth coverage and breadth.\u201d Although the class focused too much on applicable skill rather than general knowledge of language change, the students stated that they would \u201chate to see the depth lost in favor of touching on a wider range of topics.\u201d The exercises given in the course were \u201clike puzzles that really make the students think.\u201d\r\nProfessor Ringe\u2019s famous quote is \u201clinguistics is my default activity.\u201d Students commented that Professor Ringe conveyed his knowledge to students so easily that the class was described as \u201cstory time with Ringe.\u201d Students stated that his passion for the subject made the class much more interesting.\r\nAlthough the course was \u201cenjoyable and valuable to the major,\u201d students commented that it required too much basic knowledge about linguistics for an introductory class meant to fulfill a general requirement. Students recommended that at least an introductory linguistics class like LING001 be taken before this course in order to \u201cfully absorb the material.\u201d", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/16010/sections/001/reviews/728-DONALD-A--RINGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/728-DONALD-A--RINGE", "first_name": "DONALD A.", "last_name": "RINGE", "id": "728-DONALD-A--RINGE", "name": "DONALD A.
