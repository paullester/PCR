{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1936"}, "description": "Popular culture has been the focus of serious historical inquiry in mainstream history since at least the 1950s and much of this mainstream literature has included some attention to science and technology. But in history of science, popular culture has most commonly been seen as the study of \"science and the press\" (Goodfield, Nelkin, LaFollette) or as the study of the distortion of scientific ideas by the ignorant common fold (Burnham, most egregiously). In this course, intended for advanced majors and graduate students, we will explore the relevance of popular culture to historians of science. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SCI IN POPULAR CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3131/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SCI IN POPULAR CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-410-301", "path": "/courses/3131/sections/301", "id": "3131-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-410-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/3131/sections/301/reviews/665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "first_name": "MARY SUSAN", "last_name": "LINDEE", "id": "665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "name": "MARY SUSAN LINDEE"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "3131-301-665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-410", "path": "/courses/3131", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3131/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCI IN POPULAR CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-410-301", "path": "/courses/3131/sections/301", "id": "3131-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-410-301"]}]}, "id": 3131, "aliases": ["HSSC-410"]}
