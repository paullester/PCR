{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3210"}, "description": "An examination of major trends of thought in experimental psychology in relation to philosopohy and the philosophy of science. Questions to be asked include: What is the subject matter and object of explanation of experimental psychology? What is the relation between psychology and neuroscience? How is scientific psychology related to traditional philosophical investigations of the mental? The course covers the classical systems and schools of psychology, starting with Wundt and James, and proceeding to behaviorism, Gestalt psychology, cognitive and perceptual psychology, and cognitive science. The second half of the course examines contemporary problems, including: introspection and consciousness; philosophical foundations of cognitive science (computation vs. information); theories of the extended and embodied mind; methodological and conceptual problems in investigating the evolution of mind, brain, and culture; and the relation between neuroscience and psychology, using cases from particular areas such as attention and memory. Readings will include works by Koehler, Skinner, Fodor, Shapiro, and others. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8208/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.22", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-426-401", "path": "/courses/8208/sections/401", "id": "8208-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-426-401", "HSSC-426-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/8208/sections/401/reviews/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "first_name": "GARY", "last_name": "HATFIELD", "id": "1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "name": "GARY HATFIELD"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "8208-401-1671-GARY-HATFIELD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-426", "path": "/courses/8208", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8208/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-426-401", "path": "/courses/8208/sections/401", "id": "8208-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-426-401", "HSSC-426-401"]}]}, "id": 8208, "aliases": ["PHIL-426", "HSSC-426"]}
