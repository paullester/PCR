Lectures focus on Zeno's paradoxes of space, time and motion, on Democritus' atomistic concept of empty space and Aristotle's topos, and on the development of cosmology from Aristotle-Ptolemy to Copernicus, Tycho, Brahe, and Kepler. Students will also study the development of a new worldview in the XVI-XVIII centuries; Descartes, Galilei and Newton. Some lectures will be devoted to the crisis of the mechanical worldview and the origin of the modern science: theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and relativistic cosmology. \r\nMost students liked the course moderately, using words like \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cgreat.\u201d They learned the history of many scientific accomplishments, but some would have preferred more focus on the philosophical implications, rather than just the history. Thus, some thought it was \u201cpoorly named and organized,\u201d with \u201chaphazard lectures.\u201d They also thought the pace \u201ccould be sped up slightly.\u201d Assigned books were \u201cvery explanatory and fairly easy to get through quickly.\u201d Students\u2019 knowledge was tested by two exams. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents adored Professor Domotor for being \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d and \u201caccessible.\u201d He is \u201cgifted at explaining very difficult concepts,\u201d which was able to engage students through his \u201camazing ability to communicate the subject matter\u201d and also by explaining concepts in a manner that is \u201cnot only revealing and insightful but also humorous.\u201d Students called him \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d and his knowledge \u201cunbounded.\u201d He was very willing to answer questions and clarify material for students. Professor Domotor stimulated student interest and made class \u201cvery enjoyable.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;\r\nAlthough students praised the course content and the instructor, the two exams received nothing but negative reviews and dampened the enjoyment they got out of the course. Exams were extremely difficult, because they are much too long, such that \u201cno one ever finishes or writes intelligently.\u201d They felt \u201ccaught off guard\u201d but the limited time (only one hour) and \u201cspecific\u201d questions. They felt that the exams resulted in \u201cso little correlation\u201d between one\u2019s grade and one\u2019s actual knowledge of the material. Some thought that this made the class \u201cnot as easy\u201d as they\u2019d anticipated. Still, most felt that, in spite of the difficult exams, the course was \u201cwell worth the effort in the end\u201d and highly recommend it: \u201cDo not miss out on this class.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 111, "path": "/courses/17895/sections/401/reviews/954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR", "first_name": "ZOLTAN", "last_name": "DOMOTOR", "id": "954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR", "name": "ZOLTAN DOMOTOR"}, "num_reviewers": 98, "id": "17895-401-954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR"}]
