{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5477"}, "description": "This course takes the verb 'making' in its most literal sense and explores the various projects through which reformers, politicians, scientists, and doctors sought, through actual projects, to modernize British India. These varied, imaginiative and wide ranging projects ranged from attempts to change the diet and dress of the nation to changing its economic and agricultural practices. Since these projects straddle the space marked off by the twin ideologies of nationalism and modernism, we will begin the seminar by exploring some of the relevant theories of both these ideologies. We will then proceed to develop and deepen that theoretical understanding through a number of case studies. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "MAKING INDIA MODERN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28135/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "MAKING INDIA MODERN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-586-401", "path": "/courses/28135/sections/401", "id": "28135-401", "aliases": ["SAST-586-401", "HSSC-546-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/28135/sections/401/reviews/5765-PROJIT-BIHARI-MUKHARJI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5765-PROJIT-BIHARI-MUKHARJI", "first_name": "PROJIT BIHARI", "last_name": "MUKHARJI", "id": "5765-PROJIT-BIHARI-MUKHARJI", "name": "PROJIT BIHARI MUKHARJI"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "28135-401-5765-PROJIT-BIHARI-MUKHARJI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-586", "path": "/courses/28135", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28135/sections", "values": [{"name": "MAKING INDIA MODERN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-586-401", "path": "/courses/28135/sections/401", "id": "28135-401", "aliases": ["SAST-586-401", "HSSC-546-401"]}]}, "id": 28135, "aliases": ["SAST-586", "HSSC-546"]}
