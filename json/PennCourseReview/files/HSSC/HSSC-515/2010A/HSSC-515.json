{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3761"}, "description": "The history of computing is about more than just the electronic digital computer. It is the story of a wide range of human activities, scientific practices, and technological developments. The story begins in the early 19th century with the emergence of new demands for information management -- from scientific researchers, expanding government bureaucracies, and increasingly national and international corporations. It includes not only \"computers\" (itself a large and diverse category) but data processing, communications, and visualization technolgoeis, as well as people, practices and organizational structures. In this course we will explore the history of computing in all of its forms and varieties. We will situate the computer in the broader history of technology, but also consider it from the perspectives of the history of science, labor history and social history. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "THE HISTORY OF COMPUTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26235/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "THE HISTORY OF COMPUTING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-515-301", "path": "/courses/26235/sections/301", "id": "26235-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-515-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/26235/sections/301/reviews/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "first_name": "NATHAN", "last_name": "ENSMENGER", "id": "664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "name": "NATHAN ENSMENGER"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "26235-301-664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-515", "path": "/courses/26235", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26235/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE HISTORY OF COMPUTING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-515-301", "path": "/courses/26235/sections/301", "id": "26235-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-515-301"]}]}, "id": 26235, "aliases": ["HSSC-515"]}
