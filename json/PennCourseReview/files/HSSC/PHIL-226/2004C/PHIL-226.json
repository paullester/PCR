{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/879"}, "description": "This course consists of a detailed examination of evolutionary theory and its philosophical foundations. The course begins with a consideration of Darwin's formulation of evolutionary theory and the main influences on Darwin. We will then consider two contemporary presentations of the theory Richard Dawkins' and Richard Lewontin's. The remainder of the course will deal with a number of foundational issues and may include discussions of adaptation, what constitutes a species, whether there is evolutionary progress, and the concept of fitness. We will also discuss the units of selection, the alleged reduction of classical genetics to molecular genetics, and the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5739/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.16", "rDifficulty": "2.48", "rStimulateInterest": "3.48", "rRecommendMajor": "3.48", "rCourseQuality": "3.28", "rWorkRequired": "2.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.84", "rReadingsValue": "2.96", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.48", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-226-401", "path": "/courses/5739/sections/401", "id": "5739-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-226-401", "HSSC-266-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/5739/sections/401/reviews/2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "WEISBERG", "id": "2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "name": "MICHAEL WEISBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "5739-401-2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-226", "path": "/courses/5739", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5739/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-226-401", "path": "/courses/5739/sections/401", "id": "5739-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-226-401", "HSSC-266-401"]}]}, "id": 5739, "aliases": ["PHIL-226", "HSSC-266"]}
