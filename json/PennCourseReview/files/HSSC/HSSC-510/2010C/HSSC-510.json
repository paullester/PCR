{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3760"}, "description": "This course will review major developments in biomolecular sciences and Many historians of science, technology and medicine have embraced the study of popular culture in recent years. They have drawn on a rich literature in mainstream history, on the history of reading, of the book, of museums, of oral culture, journalism, theater, and of the mass media including radio and television. Some have even proposed that popular culture provides insights into elite knowledge systems that are not accessible in other kinds of sources,thus privileging what is publicly known over the traditional private textual, visual and material records of the archive or museum. In this graduate research seminar we will be exploring the relevance of the study of popular culture to the history of science, technology and medicine. Participants will write an original research paper in which they draw on popular culture as a resource for the interpretation of practices, theories and material resources in natural knowledge systems. Readings will generally focus on surveys that explicitly discuss methods, though we will also read some primary sources possibly including science fiction texts, memoirs of patients, engineers, physicians and scientists, gee-whiz popular science books, and didactic books intended for children. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "SCI AND POPULAR CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23259/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.80", "rDifficulty": "3.40", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "SCI AND POPULAR CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-510-301", "path": "/courses/23259/sections/301", "id": "23259-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-510-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/23259/sections/301/reviews/665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "first_name": "MARY SUSAN", "last_name": "LINDEE", "id": "665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "name": "MARY SUSAN LINDEE"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "23259-301-665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-510", "path": "/courses/23259", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23259/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCI AND POPULAR CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-510-301", "path": "/courses/23259/sections/301", "id": "23259-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-510-301"]}]}, "id": 23259, "aliases": ["HSSC-510"]}
