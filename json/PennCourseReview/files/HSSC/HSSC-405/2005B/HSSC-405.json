{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3701"}, "description": "This seminar will explore the emergence of modern science fiction as a genre, the ways it has reflected our evolving conceptions of ourselves and the universe, and its role as the mythology of modern technological civilization. Each seminar meeting will focus on a different classic SF novel and the themes it treats: introductory remarks and brief background reports will be followed by in-depth comparative discussion. We will treat the novels not as literature, but as artifacts of the cultural history of science and technology in the 20th century. Among our themes will be science and utopia, the exploration of space and time, biological engineering, superman, robots, aliens, and other worlds-and the differences between European and American treatments. The seminar will also explore the social phenomena associated with SF: pulps, fandom, juveniles, and the spread to other media (notably film and TV). Students should expect to read two short SF novels per week, and have several film assignments; grading will be based on reports, weekly discussion sheets, class participation, and a final 8 page paper on an approved topic. \n\n", "semester": "2005B", "name": "SCIENCE FICTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11223/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "SCIENCE FICTION", "sectionnum": "940", "primary_alias": "HSSC-405-940", "path": "/courses/11223/sections/940", "id": "11223-940", "aliases": ["HSSC-405-940"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/11223/sections/940/reviews/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "first_name": "MARK B", "last_name": "ADAMS", "id": "663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "name": "MARK B ADAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "11223-940-663-MARK-B-ADAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-405", "path": "/courses/11223", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11223/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCIENCE FICTION", "sectionnum": "940", "primary_alias": "HSSC-405-940", "path": "/courses/11223/sections/940", "id": "11223-940", "aliases": ["HSSC-405-940"]}]}, "id": 11223, "aliases": ["HSSC-405"]}
