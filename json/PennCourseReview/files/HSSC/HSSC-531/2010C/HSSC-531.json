{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5130"}, "description": "This is a graduate reading seminar in which we will be trying to understand how science and imperialism shaped each other in helping to create the modern period (we will concentrate on the period 1750-1900). We will look at the ways in which the modern sciences took shape, paying particular attention to new schemes for naming various natural kinds (from animals, plants and people to chemical elements and electrical units) and at the types of scientific work (especially collecting, classifying and setting standards) that are the prerequisites for new systems of names. \n\nIn addition to analyzing specific examples, both of particular sciences and of particular imperial/colonial situations, we will be taking a critical look at some of the explanatory and theoretical models of science in its imperial context that have been offered by historians and sociologists. And we will be discussing whether such models help or hinder historians in their work. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "SCIENCE & IMPERIALISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23260/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "SCIENCE & IMPERIALISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-531-301", "path": "/courses/23260/sections/301", "id": "23260-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-531-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/23260/sections/301/reviews/5546-JAMES-JOHN-ENDERSBY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5546-JAMES-JOHN-ENDERSBY", "first_name": "JAMES JOHN", "last_name": "ENDERSBY", "id": "5546-JAMES-JOHN-ENDERSBY", "name": "JAMES JOHN ENDERSBY"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "23260-301-5546-JAMES-JOHN-ENDERSBY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-531", "path": "/courses/23260", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23260/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCIENCE & IMPERIALISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-531-301", "path": "/courses/23260/sections/301", "id": "23260-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-531-301"]}]}, "id": 23260, "aliases": ["HSSC-531"]}
