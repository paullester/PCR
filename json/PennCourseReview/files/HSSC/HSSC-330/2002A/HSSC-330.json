{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/636"}, "description": "This course explores the gendered nature of science as social endeavor, intellectual construct and political resource. We consider the rise of gentlemanly science, masculinity and the arms race, the notion of a \"Successor science\" grounded in feminist theory, and the historical role of gender in defining who can do science and what counts as scientific data. We also explore how science has interpreted male-female differences. Our goal is to understand the profound impact of social place in the history of science, and thereby to understand the social nature of scientific knowledge. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "GENDER AND SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/636/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.79", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "GENDER AND SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-330-301", "path": "/courses/636/sections/301", "id": "636-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-330-301", "WSTD-330-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/636/sections/301/reviews/665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "first_name": "MARY SUSAN", "last_name": "LINDEE", "id": "665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE", "name": "MARY SUSAN LINDEE"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "636-301-665-MARY-SUSAN-LINDEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-330", "path": "/courses/636", "sections": {"path": "/courses/636/sections", "values": [{"name": "GENDER AND SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-330-301", "path": "/courses/636/sections/301", "id": "636-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-330-301", "WSTD-330-301"]}]}, "id": 636, "aliases": ["HSSC-330", "WSTD-330"]}
