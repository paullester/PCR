{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3758"}, "description": "This undergraduate seminar will focus on the relationship between science and religion as depicted in popular 20th-century novels by such authors as H.G. Wells, Olaf Stapledon, C.S. Lewis, Aldous Huxley, Issac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, Kurt Vonnegut, Umberto Eco, Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert and Arthur C. Clarke. The course will be organized chronologically and thematically around the discussion of one or more novels per week. Given that several of these novels have been made into film or television versions, we will also be comparing the ways the science-religion relationship is depicted differently in various media. Course requirements include active participation in seminar discussion; short weekly papers; class reports (on authors, secondary literature on science and religion or other non-fiction works); and a final research paper. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "SCIENCE AND RELIGION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12000/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "SCIENCE AND RELIGION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-301-301", "path": "/courses/12000/sections/301", "id": "12000-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-301-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/12000/sections/301/reviews/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "first_name": "MARK B", "last_name": "ADAMS", "id": "663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "name": "MARK B ADAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "12000-301-663-MARK-B-ADAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-301", "path": "/courses/12000", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12000/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCIENCE AND RELIGION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-301-301", "path": "/courses/12000/sections/301", "id": "12000-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-301-301"]}]}, "id": 12000, "aliases": ["HSSC-301"]}
