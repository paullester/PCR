{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1047"}, "description": "A sociological theory is a verbal (but sometimes also mathematical) argument about core social processes underlying the apparently irreducible variety of social life. This course will review theoretical perspectives developed after the \"classical\" period of Durkheim, Weber, and Marx, and particularly since WWII. Theories to be covered include: micro-sociological perspectives of phenomenology, symbolic interactionism, and neo-Durkheimian interaction ritual theory; social behaviorism, exchange theory, and rational choice theory; neo-Marxian perspectives on power, conflict, and class; accounts of modernity and post-modernity; and the systems theories of Parsons and Luhmann. Recurring themes will include the micro-macro connection, the relationship between subjectivity and behavior, and the structure-agency problem. The course satisfies the theory requirement for sociology majors. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CONTEMPORARY SOCIO THEOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1047/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-126", "path": "/courses/1047", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1047/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEMPORARY SOCIO THEOR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SOCI-126-001", "path": "/courses/1047/sections/001", "id": "1047-001", "aliases": ["SOCI-126-001"]}]}, "id": 1047, "aliases": ["SOCI-126"]}
