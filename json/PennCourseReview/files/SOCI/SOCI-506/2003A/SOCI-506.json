{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1517"}, "description": "An examination of the theory and practice of minority representation in television, film, advertising and music. The course focuses on representation and how it may work to marginalize or empower members of minority populations. It concentrates on ethnic minorities (African Americans, Native Americans, Latino's), as well as sexual minorities. How has \"minority\" been defined--who is included and why? How have notations of \"minority\" status been constructed in mass media and what may be the potential impact of those images both on minority and non-minority populations? While the class is theoretically situated in sociology and communications, it also considers how the perspectives of anthropology, feminism, and ethnic studies have affected our understanding of public representations. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "MINORITIES AND MEDIA: Representations of Race, Ethnicity and Nationality in Media and Culture", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2244/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "MINORITIES AND MEDIA: Representations of Race, Ethnicity and Nationality in Media and Culture", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "SOCI-506-640", "path": "/courses/2244/sections/640", "id": "2244-640", "aliases": ["SOCI-506-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/2244/sections/640/reviews/277-JESSICA-FISHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/277-JESSICA-FISHMAN", "first_name": "JESSICA", "last_name": "FISHMAN", "id": "277-JESSICA-FISHMAN", "name": "JESSICA FISHMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "2244-640-277-JESSICA-FISHMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-506", "path": "/courses/2244", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2244/sections", "values": [{"name": "MINORITIES AND MEDIA: Representations of Race, Ethnicity and Nationality in Media and Culture", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "SOCI-506-640", "path": "/courses/2244/sections/640", "id": "2244-640", "aliases": ["SOCI-506-640"]}]}, "id": 2244, "aliases": ["SOCI-506"]}
