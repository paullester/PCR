{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2928"}, "description": "This course is designed to introduce graduate students to basic concepts and skills in ethnographic field research in the social sciences, including participant observation, interviewing, field documentation, and the scholarly presentation of qualitative data. Students will learn to apply these concepts and skills through an assigned set of field exercises, and will be expected to complete a semester-long project based on intensive fieldwork at a research site of their choosing. In addition, we will examine exemplars of published fieldwork in the contemporary sociology. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "FIELD METH.
