Some students complained about the lack of structure in the class. The class seems to focus a lot on history in the first half of the semester and really only turns to the present in the last weeks of class&#8232;&#8232;The students gave great reports for Professor Bosk. Despite the occasional boring lecture, students praised him for trying his best to inspire interest among students. He was described as a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d \u201cinsightful,\u201d and \u201ca pleasure to be in class with.\u201d Professor Bosk was very approachable and accessible.&#8232;&#8232;Students really enjoyed the reading list that was assigned in class. Students of all grades and majors took the class. The course does not satisfy any requirements within the sector or foundational approaches within the college.
