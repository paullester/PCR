{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2134"}, "description": "Economic sociology examines the production and exchange of goods and services from the viewpoint of the social relationships in which economic activities are embedded, the social conditions for economic change, and the effects of these arrangements upon social inequality and well-being. Topics include historical theories of capitalism; socialist economies and transitions; the global economy; institutions and cultures underpinning various kinds of market and nonmarket exchanges. Network analysis has been on the forefront of new models of how economic exchange is structured. This course surveys network theories of Harrison White, Burt, Zelizer and others, as well as related analyses of network effects upon careers, power, conflict, and social movements. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "INTRO ECON & NETWORK SOC: Intro to Economic & Network Sociology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3530/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO ECON & NETWORK SOC: Intro to Economic & Network Sociology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SOCI-540-301", "path": "/courses/3530/sections/301", "id": "3530-301", "aliases": ["SOCI-540-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/3530/sections/301/reviews/1100-RANDALL-COLLINS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1100-RANDALL-COLLINS", "first_name": "RANDALL", "last_name": "COLLINS", "id": "1100-RANDALL-COLLINS", "name": "RANDALL COLLINS"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "3530-301-1100-RANDALL-COLLINS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-540", "path": "/courses/3530", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3530/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO ECON & NETWORK SOC: Intro to Economic & Network Sociology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SOCI-540-301", "path": "/courses/3530/sections/301", "id": "3530-301", "aliases": ["SOCI-540-301"]}]}, "id": 3530, "aliases": ["SOCI-540"]}
