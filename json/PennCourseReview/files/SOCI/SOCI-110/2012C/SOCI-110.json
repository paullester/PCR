{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1041"}, "description": "This course examines the opposite ends of the economic spectrum in order to gain a fuller understanding of what social class is and how it affects individuals and society. Who is rich? Who is poor? How does wealth and income (or the lack of it) affect all aspects of life, from the obvious (access to health care, good schools, etc.) to the not-so-obvious (quality of romantic life and family relationships). We will also examine cultural aspects of social class (tastes and lifestyles), across generations. There will be a midterm and final exam, as well as several short research/reflection papers due throughout the course. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "THE RICH AND THE POOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29649/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.07", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.35", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "THE RICH AND THE POOR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SOCI-110-301", "path": "/courses/29649/sections/301", "id": "29649-301", "aliases": ["SOCI-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/29649/sections/301/reviews/6403-AMADA-ARMENTA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6403-AMADA-ARMENTA", "first_name": "AMADA", "last_name": "ARMENTA", "id": "6403-AMADA-ARMENTA", "name": "AMADA ARMENTA"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "29649-301-6403-AMADA-ARMENTA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-110", "path": "/courses/29649", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29649/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE RICH AND THE POOR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SOCI-110-301", "path": "/courses/29649/sections/301", "id": "29649-301", "aliases": ["SOCI-110-301"]}]}, "id": 29649, "aliases": ["SOCI-110"]}
