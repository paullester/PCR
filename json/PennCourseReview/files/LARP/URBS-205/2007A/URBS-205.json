{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1132"}, "description": "The built environment of a city is more than a mere backdrop; the design can affect people's experiences. Environmental design focuses on the relationship between people and the built environment. It also looks at how the built environment interacts with the natural one. This course will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of how people create, perceive, and use the designed environment. We'll approach these concepts by analyzing design at a variety of scales, from products to interior design to architecture. Finally, using that knowledge, we'll conclude by analyzing urban spaces of the city. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "POWER OF PLACE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15255/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.32", "rDifficulty": "1.84", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "3.05", "rCourseQuality": "2.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.37", "rCommAbility": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "POWER OF PLACE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-205-301", "path": "/courses/15255/sections/301", "id": "15255-301", "aliases": ["URBS-205-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/15255/sections/301/reviews/1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN", "first_name": "RICHARD WAYNE", "last_name": "BERMAN", "id": "1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN", "name": "RICHARD WAYNE BERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "15255-301-1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-205", "path": "/courses/15255", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15255/sections", "values": [{"name": "POWER OF PLACE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-205-301", "path": "/courses/15255/sections/301", "id": "15255-301", "aliases": ["URBS-205-301"]}]}, "id": 15255, "aliases": ["URBS-205"]}
