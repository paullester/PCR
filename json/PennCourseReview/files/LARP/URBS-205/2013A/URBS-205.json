{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1132"}, "description": "The built environment of a city is more than a mere backdrop; the design can actually affect people's experiences. Environmental design primarily focuses on the relationship between people and the built environment. It also looks at how the built environment interacts with the natural one (and the potential for greater sustainability). This course will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of how people create, perceive, and use the designed environment. We'll approach these concepts by analyzing design at a variety of scales, from products to interior design to architecture. Finally, using that knowledge, we'll conclude by analyzing urban spaces of the city. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO TO ENVIR DESIGN: PEOPLE & DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31098/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ENVIR DESIGN: PEOPLE & DESIGN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-205-301", "path": "/courses/31098/sections/301", "id": "31098-301", "aliases": ["URBS-205-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/31098/sections/301/reviews/1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN", "first_name": "RICHARD WAYNE", "last_name": "BERMAN", "id": "1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN", "name": "RICHARD WAYNE BERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "31098-301-1195-RICHARD-WAYNE-BERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-205", "path": "/courses/31098", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31098/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO ENVIR DESIGN: PEOPLE & DESIGN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-205-301", "path": "/courses/31098/sections/301", "id": "31098-301", "aliases": ["URBS-205-301"]}]}, "id": 31098, "aliases": ["URBS-205"]}
