{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3436"}, "description": "There is land all around us, underneath us. Its components are still the same as they were for ancient peoples- earth, air, fire, water. But except in rare moments and exceptional places, what we see is not land but \"landscape\". We turn or transform land into landscape in many ways: we write about it, map it, depict in in paintings, sketches or photographs, and we remake it into new shapes and forms (this is called landscape architecture). The seminar will explore this range of transformations and ask how and why different cultures have reformulated land in different ways. We'll look at how the land at such famous places as Yosemite or Delphi has been represented in words and images, and discuss how and why other sites like Versailles or Parc La Villette in Paris have been landscaped and their sites transformed. We'll compare a Chinese example with western ones. Two prominent Philadelphia landscape architects will share examples of their projects. We'll turn at the end to enquire into ways in which the modern cult of land art has opened new perspectives into the relationship of landscape to land. Each student will select one particular site for research and personal interpretation and present this to the whole group. A set of texts and imagery will be available in a bulkpack, and each week additional material will also be presented in \n\nslides. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "LANDSCAPE ARCH FRESH SEM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9137/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.46", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "2.54", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23"}, "section": {"name": "LANDSCAPE ARCH FRESH SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LARP-111-301", "path": "/courses/9137/sections/301", "id": "9137-301", "aliases": ["LARP-111-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/9137/sections/301/reviews/3345-JOHN-DIXON-HUNT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3345-JOHN-DIXON-HUNT", "first_name": "JOHN DIXON", "last_name": "HUNT", "id": "3345-JOHN-DIXON-HUNT", "name": "JOHN DIXON HUNT"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "9137-301-3345-JOHN-DIXON-HUNT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LARP-111", "path": "/courses/9137", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9137/sections", "values": [{"name": "LANDSCAPE ARCH FRESH SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LARP-111-301", "path": "/courses/9137/sections/301", "id": "9137-301", "aliases": ["LARP-111-301"]}]}, "id": 9137, "aliases": ["LARP-111"]}
