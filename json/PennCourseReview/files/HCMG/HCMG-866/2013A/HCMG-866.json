{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4276"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the main components of Health Information Technology (HIT) and how HIT currently effects, and in the future, may change health care operating models. Although it will not prepare students for primary technology management positions, it will help them understand the role of information technology in the success of the delivery system and other important healthcare processes. It will provide a foundation that will prepare them as managers, investors and consultants to rely upon or manage information technology to accomplish delivery system objectives. The course will give special attention to key health care processes, and topics such as the drive for provider quality and cost improvements, the potential ability to leverage clinical data for care improvement and product development, the growth of new information technologies for consumer directed healthcare and telemedicine, the strategies and economics of individual HIT companies and the role of government. The course relies heavily on industry leaders to share their ideas and experiences with students. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "E-HEALTH:BUSINESS MODELS: E-Health: Business Models and Impact", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30421/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.21", "rDifficulty": "1.58", "rTAQuality": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "2.52", "rRecommendMajor": "2.45", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "1.53", "rInstructorAccess": "2.55", "rReadingsValue": "1.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.96"}, "section": {"name": "E-HEALTH:BUSINESS MODELS: E-Health: Business Models and Impact", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-866-001", "path": "/courses/30421/sections/001", "id": "30421-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-866-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/30421/sections/001/reviews/5379-JOHN-GLASER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5379-JOHN-GLASER", "first_name": "JOHN", "last_name": "GLASER", "id": "5379-JOHN-GLASER", "name": "JOHN GLASER"}, "num_reviewers": 58, "id": "30421-001-5379-JOHN-GLASER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-866", "path": "/courses/30421", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30421/sections", "values": [{"name": "E-HEALTH:BUSINESS MODELS: E-Health: Business Models and Impact", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-866-001", "path": "/courses/30421/sections/001", "id": "30421-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-866-001"]}]}, "id": 30421, "aliases": ["HCMG-866"]}
