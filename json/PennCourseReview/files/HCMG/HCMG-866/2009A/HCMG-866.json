The course will discuss the portfolio of health information technologies; the opportunities to apply these technologies to improve health care safety, quality and efficiency; the challenges of HIT implementation and value realization; and emerging HIT areas. While this course will not prepare students for primary information technology management positions, it will provide a foundation that will prepare them as managers in, and consultants to, the health care industry.
