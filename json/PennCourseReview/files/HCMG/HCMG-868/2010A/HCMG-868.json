{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4278"}, "description": "This course explores entrepreneurial and other private sector solutions for both health services and access to medicines and technology in the developing world and other underserved areas. The course also encompasses study of creative solutions such as drug development partnerships, public-private partnerships, and other incentive programs to engage the private sector in development of vaccines and medicines for tropical and neglected diseases, as well as therapeutic approaches and care systems for the rapidly growing problems of chronic diseases in populations in the developing world. The course goal is not to duplicate a conventional international public health course, but to build upon what is conventionally known and taught in such courses from a managerial solutions-oriented perspective. Learning is driven through readings, class discussions and a series of guest speakers representing the full range of global health issues. The major assignment in the course is a group student project. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "PRIV SEC ROLE GLOB HLTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26163/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.91", "rDifficulty": "1.84", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.03", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.97", "rCommAbility": "2.42", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "PRIV SEC ROLE GLOB HLTH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-868-001", "path": "/courses/26163/sections/001", "id": "26163-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-868-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/26163/sections/001/reviews/215-STEPHEN-M-SAMMUT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/215-STEPHEN-M-SAMMUT", "first_name": "STEPHEN M", "last_name": "SAMMUT", "id": "215-STEPHEN-M-SAMMUT", "name": "STEPHEN M SAMMUT"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "26163-001-215-STEPHEN-M-SAMMUT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-868", "path": "/courses/26163", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26163/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRIV SEC ROLE GLOB HLTH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-868-001", "path": "/courses/26163/sections/001", "id": "26163-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-868-001"]}]}, "id": 26163, "aliases": ["HCMG-868"]}
