{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4582"}, "description": "This course examines the structure of health care systems in different countries, focusing on financing, reimbursement, delivery systems and adoption of new technologies. We study the relative roles of private sector and public sector insurance and providers, and the effect of system design on cost, quality, efficiency and equity of medical services. Some issues we address are normative: Which systems and which public/private sector mixes are better at achieving efficiency and equity? Other issues are positive: How do these different systems deal with the tough choices, such as decisions about new technologies? Our main focus is on the systems in four large OECD countries- Germany, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom - but we also look at other countries with interesting systems - including Italy, Chile, and Singapore and developing countries including China and India. We will draw lessons for the U.S. from foreign experience and vice versa. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "COMPARATIVE HC SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24520/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.62", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.41", "rInstructorAccess": "2.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.12", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.94", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "COMPARATIVE HC SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-859-401", "path": "/courses/24520/sections/401", "id": "24520-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-859-401", "HCMG-204-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/24520/sections/401/reviews/602-PATRICIA-M-DANZON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/602-PATRICIA-M-DANZON", "first_name": "PATRICIA M", "last_name": "DANZON", "id": "602-PATRICIA-M-DANZON", "name": "PATRICIA M DANZON"}, "num_reviewers": 37, "id": "24520-401-602-PATRICIA-M-DANZON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-859", "path": "/courses/24520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24520/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMPARATIVE HC SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-859-401", "path": "/courses/24520/sections/401", "id": "24520-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-859-401", "HCMG-204-401"]}]}, "id": 24520, "aliases": ["HCMG-859", "HCMG-204"]}
