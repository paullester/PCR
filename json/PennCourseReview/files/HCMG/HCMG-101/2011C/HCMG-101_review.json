The roles of patients, physicians, hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies will be established.  The interaction between the government and these different groups will also be covered.

The course aims to provide skills for critical and analytical thought about the U.S. health care system and the people in it.\r\n\r\nReviews for this course were mixed.
