{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/561"}, "description": "This course will explore the effects of the changing health care environment on the physician, patient and health care manager. It is intended for any undergraduate with an interest in how 1/7th of the American economy is organized as well as those planning careers as health care providers and managers. The course complements other health care courses (that take a societal perspective) by focusing on the individuals who participate in the health care enterprise. There are no prerequisites, as the course will stand on its own content. The course will be divided into modules that focus on the participants of the health care process and the process itself. We will analyze the patient, the doctor, and manager in light of the patient-doctor interaction, the turbulent health care marketplace, expensive new technologies,resource allocation, and ethics. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "CLIN ISS IN HLTH CR MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26154/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.72", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "1.81", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "CLIN ISS IN HLTH CR MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-203-001", "path": "/courses/26154/sections/001", "id": "26154-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-203-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 66, "path": "/courses/26154/sections/001/reviews/601-DAVID-A-ASCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/601-DAVID-A-ASCH", "first_name": "DAVID A", "last_name": "ASCH", "id": "601-DAVID-A-ASCH", "name": "DAVID A ASCH"}, "num_reviewers": 62, "id": "26154-001-601-DAVID-A-ASCH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-203", "path": "/courses/26154", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26154/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLIN ISS IN HLTH CR MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-203-001", "path": "/courses/26154/sections/001", "id": "26154-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-203-001"]}]}, "id": 26154, "aliases": ["HCMG-203"]}
