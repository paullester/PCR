{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3397"}, "description": "This course presents an overview of the business of health and how a variety of health care organizations have gained, sustained, and lost competitive advantage amidst intense competition, widespread regulation, high interdependence, and massive technological, economic, social and political changes. Specifically, we evaluate the challenges facing health care organizations using competitive analysis, identify their past responses, and explore the current strategies they are using to manage these challenges (and emerging ones) more effectively. Students will develop generalized skills in competitive analysis and the ability to apply those skills in the specialized analysis of opportunities in producer (e.g. biopharmaceutical, medical product, information technology), purchaser (e.g. insurance), and provider (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, physician) organizations and industry sectors. The course is organized around a number of readings, cases, presentations, and a required project. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "HC MGMT&STRAT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24515/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.72", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "3.03", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.24", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.52", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "HC MGMT&STRAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-213-001", "path": "/courses/24515/sections/001", "id": "24515-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-213-001"]}, "comments": "Health Care Management 213 presents an overview of the business of health and how a variety of health care organizations have gained, sustained, and lost competitive advantage amidst intense competition, widespread regulation, high interdependence, and massive technological, economic, social and political changes.
