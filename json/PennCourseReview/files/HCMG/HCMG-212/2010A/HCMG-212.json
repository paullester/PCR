{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3650"}, "description": "This course will familiarize students with methods used to assess the quality of hospital or provider health care using outcomes data, and to understand and evaluate studies involving health care outcomes. Students are exposed to the mechanics of hospital quality evaluation and challenged to evaluate the medical and health services research literature on health care evaluation, as well as to make inferences regarding hospital quality and the comparison or rankings of hospitals or providers. Topics will include the history of health care outcomes analysis; the conceptual framework for outcome studies; consumer demand for information; an overview of medical data and data collection systems; a description of outcome statistics and severity adjstments currently in use; the study of excess variation in outcomes; and the use of guidelines to assess outcomes. By the end of the course, students will have developed a thorough appreciation of the current methods used by policy makers, researchers, and health care providers to evaluate medical outcomes, as well as those used by consumers to choose hospitals and providers. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HC QUALITY & OUTCOMES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26155/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.28", "rDifficulty": "2.68", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.73", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.04", "rCommAbility": "2.84", "rInstructorQuality": "2.87"}, "section": {"name": "HC QUALITY & OUTCOMES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-212-001", "path": "/courses/26155/sections/001", "id": "26155-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-212-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/26155/sections/001/reviews/3653-JEFFREY-H-SILBER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3653-JEFFREY-H-SILBER", "first_name": "JEFFREY H", "last_name": "SILBER", "id": "3653-JEFFREY-H-SILBER", "name": "JEFFREY H SILBER"}, "num_reviewers": 31, "id": "26155-001-3653-JEFFREY-H-SILBER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-212", "path": "/courses/26155", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26155/sections", "values": [{"name": "HC QUALITY & OUTCOMES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-212-001", "path": "/courses/26155/sections/001", "id": "26155-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-212-001"]}]}, "id": 26155, "aliases": ["HCMG-212"]}
