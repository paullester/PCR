{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4584"}, "description": "The purpose of this doctoral level course is to investigate the theory and practice of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis as applied to health care. The three techniques to be examined are cost-effectiveness analysis with single dimensional outcomes, cost effectiveness analysis with multiple attributes (especially in the form of Quality Adjusted Life Years), and economic cost-benefit analysis. Valuation of mortality and morbidity relative to other goods will be emphasized. Students will be expected to develop written critiques of articles in the literature, and to design a new application of one of the techniques as a term project. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "SEM:HLTH CARE COST BEN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17474/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.78", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SEM:HLTH CARE COST BEN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HCMG-901-301", "path": "/courses/17474/sections/301", "id": "17474-301", "aliases": ["HCMG-901-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/17474/sections/301/reviews/337-MARK-V--PAULY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/337-MARK-V--PAULY", "first_name": "MARK V.", "last_name": "PAULY", "id": "337-MARK-V--PAULY", "name": "MARK V.
