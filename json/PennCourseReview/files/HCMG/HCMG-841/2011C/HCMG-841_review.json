It examines the unique features of health care as a product, and the changing relationships between patients, physicians, hospitals, insurers, employers, communities, and government. The course examines three broad segments of the health care industry: payors, providers, and suppliers. Within the payor segment, the course examines the sources and destinations of spending, managed care (HMOs, PPOs), employer based health insurance, technology assessment, payor strategy, and efforts to pay for the elderly, the poor, and the medically indigent. Within the provider segment, the course examines the impact of cost containment and competition on hospitals and integrated delivery systems, long term care and disease management, and the important role of epidemiology in assessing population health needs and risks. Within the supplier segment, the course will examine developments in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical devices, genomics and IT industries.
