{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4579"}, "description": "This course offers a current and historical overview of the legal oversight and regulation of health care delivery in the U.S. It examines principles and practicalapplications of the laws that affect the operational decisions of health care providers, payors, and managers and that impact development of markets for health care products and services. Also considered are the social , moral, and ethical issues encountered in trying to balance the interests, needs and rights of individuals against those of the larger society. For part of the term, the class will divide into two groups so that students can focus on their choice of (a) health care management or (b) selected issues of patients' rights.
