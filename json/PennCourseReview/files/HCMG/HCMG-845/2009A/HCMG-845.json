{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4273"}, "description": "This course, co-taught with Brad Fluegel (former Senior VP of Wellpoint, Inc.) will focus on two interrelated topics: managed care and market structure. The section on managed care will cover strategic planning and marketing of managed care services, operational issues in developing a managed care network, actuarial issues, and the management of physician behavior. The section on health care market structure will analyze strategies of vertical integration and horizontal integration (M+As), and their attempt to alter the balance of power in local healthcare markets. The section will also analyze the operational issues in managing cost and quality in an integrated system, integration along the supply chain, and the performance of these systems, and the bargaining and negotiation between hospitals, physicians, and health plans. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "MANAGED CARE AND INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15863/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "MANAGED CARE AND INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-845-001", "path": "/courses/15863/sections/001", "id": "15863-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-845-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/15863/sections/001/reviews/3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "first_name": "LAWTON R", "last_name": "BURNS", "id": "3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "name": "LAWTON R BURNS"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "15863-001-3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-845", "path": "/courses/15863", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15863/sections", "values": [{"name": "MANAGED CARE AND INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HCMG-845-001", "path": "/courses/15863/sections/001", "id": "15863-001", "aliases": ["HCMG-845-001"]}]}, "id": 15863, "aliases": ["HCMG-845"]}
