Defined as companies that manage, distribute or provide health care services, the Health Care Services sector touches almost every other portion of the health care system. We will study the key management issues related to a number of different health care services businesses with a focus on common challenges related to reimbursement, regulatory, margin, growth, and competitive issues. We will make extensive use of outside speakers who will all be current industry leaders within different sectors of the health care services industry and will address the current management issues they face in running their businesses. We will also hear Private Equity professionals and people involved legislatively in Washington with health care services. Students will then be asked to develop a plan to both buyout and subsequently manage a specific health care services business. Students will present their plans to a panel of leading Health Care Private Equity investors.\r\n\r\nStudents, as a whole, loved this course.

They thought that he was \u201can excellent professor and good at motivating and communicating with the class.\u201d Even though he is very busy, students thought that Professor Present made time to talk to students who had questions or were seeking career advice.\r\n\r\nThere were not many complaints on the difficulty of the course. Most students liked that they got the opportunity to present to real private equity investors while some felt that \u201cthey could use a more helpful guide as a template for these presentations.\u201d \r\n", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/17473/sections/001/reviews/4838-DOUGLAS-PRESENT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4838-DOUGLAS-PRESENT", "first_name": "DOUGLAS", "last_name": "PRESENT", "id": "4838-DOUGLAS-PRESENT", "name": "DOUGLAS PRESENT"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "17473-001-4838-DOUGLAS-PRESENT"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.74", "rDifficulty": "1.73", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.52", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.19", "rCommAbility": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "2.77"}, "section": {"name": "ASP: MEDICAL DEVICES", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "HCMG-890-002", "path": "/courses/17473/sections/002", "id": "17473-002", "aliases": ["HCMG-890-002"]}, "comments": "HCMG 890 examines issues related to managing or investing in Health Care Services Businesses.
