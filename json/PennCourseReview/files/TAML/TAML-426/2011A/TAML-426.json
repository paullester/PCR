{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4683"}, "description": "This course develops the skills obtained either from the Beginning Tamil course or from students' prior exposure to Tamil. The emphasis will be on using the language in actual environments both in spoken medium and in written medium. Multimedia materials such as audio and video facilities will be used extensively to provide students an exposure to the Tamil culture and customs. Besides improving their speech and writing, students will also be introduced gradually to Tamil literature, which has two thousand years of literary history. The learning process in this course will be facilitated by appropriate software equipped with multimedia facilities. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "INTERMEDIATE TAMIL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22492/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.75", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.50", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.25", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rInstructorConcern": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "3.00", "rOralSkills": "3.25", "rNativeAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "0.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rInstructorEffective": "3.75", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE TAMIL", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "TAML-426-680", "path": "/courses/22492/sections/680", "id": "22492-680", "aliases": ["TAML-426-680"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/22492/sections/680/reviews/1073-VASU-RENGANATHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1073-VASU-RENGANATHAN", "first_name": "VASU", "last_name": "RENGANATHAN", "id": "1073-VASU-RENGANATHAN", "name": "VASU RENGANATHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "22492-680-1073-VASU-RENGANATHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "TAML-426", "path": "/courses/22492", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22492/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE TAMIL", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "TAML-426-680", "path": "/courses/22492/sections/680", "id": "22492-680", "aliases": ["TAML-426-680"]}]}, "id": 22492, "aliases": ["TAML-426"]}
