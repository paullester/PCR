{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2888"}, "description": "\"Beyond Biology: Enhancing the human mind through technology\": Some people have claimed that the prevalence of various information technologies in modern society is triggering a radical alteration to the structure of the human mind. The development of cognitive-enhancing drugs and of devices that interface with nervous systems to restore cognitive functioning in brain-damaged people provides further evidence to some of the transformative potential of technology on the human mind. In this course, we will examine the philosophical hypothesis that the human mind is a product of the interaction between biology, technology (broadly conceived), and culture. We will consider whether technologies that enable or enhance human mental faculties are best viewed as proper parts of the human mind or instead as merely external aids/tools. We will also consider the moral issues surrounding the use and accessibility of such technologies. The questions that we consider in this course will get to the heart of what it means to possess a human mind and indeed to be a human being. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CONTEMPORARY PHIL: ENHANCING THE HUMAN MIND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24956/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.73", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "3.73", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEMPORARY PHIL: ENHANCING THE HUMAN MIND", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-032-301", "path": "/courses/24956/sections/301", "id": "24956-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-032-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/24956/sections/301/reviews/943-GARY-PURPURA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/943-GARY-PURPURA", "first_name": "GARY", "last_name": "PURPURA", "id": "943-GARY-PURPURA", "name": "GARY PURPURA"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "24956-301-943-GARY-PURPURA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-032", "path": "/courses/24956", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24956/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEMPORARY PHIL: ENHANCING THE HUMAN MIND", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-032-301", "path": "/courses/24956/sections/301", "id": "24956-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-032-301"]}]}, "id": 24956, "aliases": ["PHIL-032"]}
