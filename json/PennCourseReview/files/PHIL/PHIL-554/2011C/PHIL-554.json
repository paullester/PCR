{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4649"}, "description": "How does meaning determine the content of human experience? This has been one of the central questions of continental European philosophy over the past century, motivating the development of phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. In this introduction to 20th-century continental European philosophy, the centrality of phenomenology (and its interpretation) to an understanding of these movements and other contemporary trends in European thought will be emphasized. We will begin with an introduction to the work of Edmund Husserl and his phenomenological account of the intentionality of consciousness. This will be followed by an examination of three existentialist critics of Husserl, whose philosophies have influenced much of recent continental thought: Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Finally, we will examine the important influence of phenomenology and existentialism on contemporary trends n philosophy as exhibited in works by Paul Ricoeur, Hans Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, and others. Seminar. No previous background in philosophy or psychology required. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CONTEMPRY CONT'L PHILOS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24969/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEMPRY CONT'L PHILOS", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "PHIL-554-640", "path": "/courses/24969/sections/640", "id": "24969-640", "aliases": ["PHIL-554-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/24969/sections/640/reviews/957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "first_name": "STEPHEN P", "last_name": "STEINBERG", "id": "957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "name": "STEPHEN P STEINBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "24969-640-957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-554", "path": "/courses/24969", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24969/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEMPRY CONT'L PHILOS", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "PHIL-554-640", "path": "/courses/24969/sections/640", "id": "24969-640", "aliases": ["PHIL-554-640"]}]}, "id": 24969, "aliases": ["PHIL-554"]}
