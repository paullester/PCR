Our readings will include writings from Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant. We shall focus on metaphysics (the fundamental nature of reality) and epistemology (theory of knowledge). Some of the metaphysical questions dealt with by these authors concern the existence and nature of mind, matter and God, and the problem of human freedom. Some of the epistemological questions dealt with by these authors concern how much and what kind of knowledge we gain by the senses and by pure reason, and the limits of the human intellect. While we shall read these authors in order to get a sense of their historical relations to each other, the aim of the course is not to provide a sweeping survey of philosophy from Descartes through Kant. Rather, the aim is to focus on a few seminal texts in the history of modern philosophy especially appropriate to the themes noted above.\r\n\r\nMany students found this to be an \u201cinteresting course\u201d that was \u201cwell constructed\u201d and able to hold their attention. Most found the lectures to be \u201cextremely helpful\u201d and \u201cimpressively clear.\u201d However, some said that the lecture handouts were difficult to follow and \u201cwould have been more useful if they were better organized and less cluttered.\u201d Some others commented that there was perhaps \u201ca bit too much material attempted for the semester.\u201d Others stated that \u201cthe only problem was the regular changes made to the syllabus and course plan.\u201d A minority of students said they had trouble \u201cgetting into what we were discussing.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe majority of students found Professor Detlefsen to be an \u201coutstanding professor,\u201d and commented that she communicated the course matter with \u201can unparalleled grasp on the material and with terrific energy.\u201d  More students said that she \u201cdoes a great job at providing examples and making the subject matter clearer.\u201d Another student raved that the professor is \u201cso passionate and knowledgeable that it\u2019s nearly impossible not to pay attention.\u201d  Others wished that she had facilitated more discussion in the class. Some students complimented her on what she wrote on the board, but wished she had made it more \u201cnote-friendly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany people commented that the course material for this class was very difficult, and the readings, incredibly dense. Many said the readings were \u201cVERY hard\u201d and suggested that less reading would be preferable \u201cso the reading which is assigned can be studied in greater depth.\u201d Others said that using slides would have been helpful in taking notes. One student also commented that \u201cyou have to be extremely self-motivated to do well.\u201d Another said that the final was \u201cvery daunting\u201d and \u201cseems unnecessary after our third large paper.\u201d Regardless of this, most thought that this was \u201ca class worth taking\u201d even for non-majors.", "num_students": 87, "path": "/courses/20660/sections/001/reviews/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "first_name": "KAREN E.", "last_name": "DETLEFSEN", "id": "945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "name": "KAREN E.
