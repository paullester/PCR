{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/870"}, "description": "The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy, which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges, focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and in the nineteenth century, the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. \n\nWritten work will include several short papers and a final examination. Attendance at both lectures and discussion sections will be required, and participation in both can also count towards final grades. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HISTORY OF MODERN PHILOS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26595/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.96", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.35", "rInstructorQuality": "3.26"}, "section": {"name": "HISTORY OF MODERN PHILOS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-004-001", "path": "/courses/26595/sections/001", "id": "26595-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-004-001"]}, "comments": "In this course, students read and analyze some of the centrally important works of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century philosophy, including writings from Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant. The course focuses on metaphysics (the fundamental nature of reality) and epistemology (theory of knowledge). The aim of the course is to focus on a few seminal texts in the history of modern philosophy especially appropriate to the themes noted above, not to provide a broad survey of philosophy.\r\n\r\nStudents who took this course generally reported learning a great deal. Many complimented the course material as \u201crather interesting,\u201d \u201cexcellent,\u201d and \u201ca good introduction to philosophical inquiry.\u201d However, a common complaint was that there was \u201ctoo much material packed into each lecture\u201d and students also found the recitation \u201clargely-useless.\u201d A few students complained that the essay questions for the course were graded \u201cbased on whether or not you adhered to a strictly bland summary of the works\u201d rather than \u201canalysis or argument using the material as a subject.\u201d While the readings were \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201ctough;\u201d as one student put it, \u201cit's a lot of work, but you gain a lot from it.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Detlefsen has earned her students' stamp of approval. Not only does one student think she is \u201cthe bomb,\u201d but also claims she is \u201cthe coolest person around and an awesome philosopher.\u201d Her pupils especially extoll her lecturing prowess. They report that though there are weekly readings, \u201cthe professor is so good that attending lectures is enough to do the work.\u201d On top of that, Professor Detlefsen \u201cexplains philosophy in a way that is accessible novices.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students found that there was \u201ctoo much material packed into each lecture\u201d and that Professor Detlefsen often had to \u201cbrush aside people\u2019s questions in order to get through the material.\u201d In addition, some students thought that \u201cthe essay questions were poorly written\u201d which was \u201cmade it difficult to achieve a good grade.\u201d Overall, however, students found that \u201cthe work load [was] light\u201d and that \u201cattending lecture is enough to do the work.\u201d Though some thought the readings were \u201cdifficult,\u201d others thought they were \u201cclear\u201d and \u201chelpful.\u201d This course fulfills the requirement for the History and Tradition Sector.", "num_students": 73, "path": "/courses/26595/sections/001/reviews/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "first_name": "KAREN E.", "last_name": "DETLEFSEN", "id": "945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "name": "KAREN E.
