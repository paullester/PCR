{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3678"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to some of the central problems in global justice. Our goal is to see how philosophical analysis and reasoning can help shed light on some of the central problems of global justice. Samples of these topics include: What are our duties to respond to world poverty and what is the basis of this duty? Is global inequality in itself a matter of justice? How universal are human rights? Should human rights defer to cultural claims at all? Is there a right to intervene in another country to protect human rights there? Indeed can intervention to protect human rights ever be a duty? Who is responsible for the environment? We will read some influential contemporary essays by philosophers on these topics with the goal of using the ideas in these papers as a springboard for further discussion and analysis of our own. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "GLOBAL JUSTICE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22274/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.45", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "3.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBAL JUSTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-271-401", "path": "/courses/22274/sections/401", "id": "22274-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-271-401", "PPE-271-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/22274/sections/401/reviews/1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "first_name": "KOK-CHOR", "last_name": "TAN", "id": "1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "name": "KOK-CHOR TAN"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "22274-401-1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-271", "path": "/courses/22274", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22274/sections", "values": [{"name": "GLOBAL JUSTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-271-401", "path": "/courses/22274/sections/401", "id": "22274-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-271-401", "PPE-271-401"]}]}, "id": 22274, "aliases": ["PHIL-271", "PPE-271"]}
