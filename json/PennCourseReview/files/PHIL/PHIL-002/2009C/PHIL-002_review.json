Many expressed surprise at how \u201cinteresting\u201d they found the material. They especially liked learning modern approaches to ethics in addition to the classical. The lecture format of the course wasn\u2019t ideal; students would have preferred a smaller class for more interactive discussion. Even though they found it \u201ca little\u201d to \u201cvery repetitive\u201d and even \u201cslow-paced,\u201d students felt that they \u201clearned a lot.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Martin as \u201camazing,\u201d \u201ceager,\u201d and \u201cincredibly engaging.\u201d She was overwhelmingly described as \u201cnice,\u201d and very \u201chelpful and available\u201d when it comes to answering questions and exploring students\u2019 thoughts. She had an \u201camazing ability to stimulate interest\u201d in ethics. Although a bit repetitive, she was a \u201cgreat lecturer\u201d and \u201cmade the class very interactive and interesting,\u201d because she was very \u201canimated\u201d during lecture. She teaches the course material well, skilled at making it accessible to students. The only complaints were a request for more office hours and a feeling that lectures were repetitive and sometimes scattered. Overall, students commended Professor Martin\u2019s instruction. One student described her as one of the \u201cbest professors at Penn.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nA combination of philosophy majors and non-philosophy majors took the course, but all felt \u201ccaptivated\u201d by the topic of ethics. Philosophy majors with more background might be bored by repetitive lectures, whereas non-majors might appreciate the redundant emphasis on unfamiliar topics. Readings are \u201cvery complex and dense,\u201d making the course \u201cdifficult.\u201d Frequent quizzes on readings force you keep up, but some students felt that readings weren\u2019t necessary until the final. However, even those who found it \u201ctough\u201d felt that the course is \u201cinteresting for someone curious about philosophy or ethics.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 95, "path": "/courses/17889/sections/001/reviews/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "first_name": "ADRIENNE M.", "last_name": "MARTIN", "id": "3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "name": "ADRIENNE M.
