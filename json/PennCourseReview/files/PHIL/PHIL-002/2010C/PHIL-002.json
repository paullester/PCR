Issues to be examined include: the nature of morality (what makes a person good or bad?), the relation between morality and religion (if there is no God is everything permitted?), the nature of the good life and the place of morality within it (why should I be moral?), as well as selected practical moral issues such as abortion, affirmative action, and responses to world hunger. Readings will be drawn both from historical sources (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Epictetus, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, and Mill) and from contemporary authors such as Peter Singer, Judity Thompson, and Bernard Williams. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23609/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "2.74", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.68"}, "section": {"name": "ETHICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-002-001", "path": "/courses/23609/sections/001", "id": "23609-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-002-001"]}, "comments": "Ethics introduces some of the central issues and texts in the philosophical study of morality in the Western tradition.

As such, \u201creadings were quite manageable,\u201d \u201cgrading is fair,\u201d and TAs were generally noted as helpful. Students recommended this class to any potential PPE major, citing it as \u201ca good intro level course.\u201d Students were universally frustrated with the clicker, which functioned as both a grade and a measure of attendance. Students felt \u201cyour grade should be based on how well you understand the material (which can be evaluated via papers, exams, etc); your grade should not be based on how often you come to class.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 96, "path": "/courses/23609/sections/001/reviews/1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER", "first_name": "SUSAN SAUVE", "last_name": "MEYER", "id": "1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER", "name": "SUSAN SAUVE MEYER"}, "num_reviewers": 80, "id": "23609-001-1662-SUSAN-SAUVE-MEYER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "3.45", "rStimulateInterest": "1.64", "rRecommendMajor": "2.82", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "2.45", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "ETHICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-002-301", "path": "/courses/23609/sections/301", "id": "23609-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-002-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/23609/sections/301/reviews/948-MILTON-W--MEYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/948-MILTON-W--MEYER", "first_name": "MILTON W.", "last_name": "MEYER", "id": "948-MILTON-W--MEYER", "name": "MILTON W.
