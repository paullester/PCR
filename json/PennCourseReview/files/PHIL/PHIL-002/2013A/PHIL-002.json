{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/868"}, "description": "This introductory course focuses on several basic ethical questions regarding human conduct (\"How ought I act?\") and life (\"What kind of life should I live?\") and on a number of prominent philosophical answers to these questions. We will explore some of the central issues and texts in the philosophical study of morality in the Western tradition, both historically (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Kant, Mill) and more recently (e.g., Peter Singer, Bernard Williams, Susan Wolf). In addition to theoretical questions about the nature of morality, the importance of personal character, and the nature of the good life and the place of morality within it, we will also discuss selected practical moral issues including--but not limited to--war, punishment of wrongdoing, suicide, and responses to world hunger. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30840/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.76", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.28", "rWorkRequired": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.61", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "ETHICS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-002-601", "path": "/courses/30840/sections/601", "id": "30840-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-002-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/30840/sections/601/reviews/1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "first_name": "ANITA L", "last_name": "ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "id": "1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "name": "ANITA L ALLEN-CASTELLITTO"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "30840-601-1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-002", "path": "/courses/30840", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30840/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHICS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-002-601", "path": "/courses/30840/sections/601", "id": "30840-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-002-601"]}]}, "id": 30840, "aliases": ["PHIL-002"]}
