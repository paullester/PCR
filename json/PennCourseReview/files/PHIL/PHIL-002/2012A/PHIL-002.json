{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/868"}, "description": "This course will introduce some of the central issues and texts in the philosophical study of morality in the Western tradition. Issues to be examined include: the nature of morality (what makes a person good or bad?), the relation between morality and religion (if there is no God is everything permitted?), the nature of the good life and the place of morality within it (why should I be moral?), as well as selected practical moral issues such as abortion, affirmative action, and responses to world hunger. Readings will be drawn both from historical sources (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Epictetus, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, and Mill) and from contemporary authors such as Peter Singer, Judity Thompson, and Bernard Williams. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27981/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.47", "rDifficulty": "2.68", "rStimulateInterest": "2.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "2.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.52", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.74", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "ETHICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-002-001", "path": "/courses/27981/sections/001", "id": "27981-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-002-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 94, "path": "/courses/27981/sections/001/reviews/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "first_name": "ADRIENNE M.", "last_name": "MARTIN", "id": "3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "name": "ADRIENNE M.
