{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/878"}, "description": "This course involves a close reading of the most important dialogues written by Plato, one of the greatest philosophers of all time. We will examine a wide range of topics in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics: What is the nature of the soul? Is there an afterlife? What are the fundamental entities in the world? What are Plato's \"forms\"? What is knowledge and what can be known? Are we born as a blank slate or is something innate in us? What is the good life? What is the best way for us to live our lives? We will see how Plato attempts to answer these quesitons in his early, middle, and late dialogues, and we will ask whether and how exactly he is self-critical and changes his views over time. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PLATO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6965/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "PLATO", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-209-301", "path": "/courses/6965/sections/301", "id": "6965-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-209-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/6965/sections/301/reviews/953-CHARLES-H--KAHN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/953-CHARLES-H--KAHN", "first_name": "CHARLES H.", "last_name": "KAHN", "id": "953-CHARLES-H--KAHN", "name": "CHARLES H.
