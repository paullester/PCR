{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4835"}, "description": "In this class we survey central philosophical issues in cognitive science. In particular, we explore what computational theories of the brain suggest concerning the traditional mind-body problem. We shall begin by examining key theories of the nature of consciousness. We shall then turn to the extended mind program, reading Andy Clark's *Natural Born Cyborgs*, and examining the program's plausibility in light of recent and anticipated work on brain-machine interfaces. We shall also consider the connectionist (neural network) approach to the computational basis of thought. After grasping the details of these approaches, we investigate the underlying metaphysical assumptions of computational theories of mind. Surprisingly, it is far from clear that computationalism about the brain entails a physicalist position about the nature of minds and their properties. This depends upon one's metaphysical assumptions about the nature of substance and properties. Intriguingly, according to the leading theories of substance, computationalism is *not* a physicalist position. But, this is all for the best, for as I urge, physicalism is an empty doctrine. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "PHIL OF COGNITIVE SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26616/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL OF COGNITIVE SCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-544-301", "path": "/courses/26616/sections/301", "id": "26616-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-544-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/26616/sections/301/reviews/3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER", "first_name": "SUSAN", "last_name": "SCHNEIDER", "id": "3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER", "name": "SUSAN SCHNEIDER"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "26616-301-3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-544", "path": "/courses/26616", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26616/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL OF COGNITIVE SCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-544-301", "path": "/courses/26616/sections/301", "id": "26616-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-544-301"]}]}, "id": 26616, "aliases": ["PHIL-544"]}
