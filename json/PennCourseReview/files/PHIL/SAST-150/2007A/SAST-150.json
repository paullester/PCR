{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4123"}, "description": "This course will take the student through the major topics of Indian philosophyby first introducing the fundamental concepts and terms that are necessary for a deeper understanding of themes that pervade the philosophical literature of India -- arguments for and against the existence of God, for example, the ontological status of external objects, the means of valid knowledge, standardsof proof, the discourse on the aims of life. The readings will emphasize classical Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical articulations (from 700 B.C.Eto 16th century CE) but we will also supplement our study of these materials with contemporary or relatively recent philosophical writings in modern India. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "INTRO TO INDIAN PHILOS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15140/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.19", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO INDIAN PHILOS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-150-401", "path": "/courses/15140/sections/401", "id": "15140-401", "aliases": ["SAST-150-401", "RELS-155-401", "PHIL-050-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/15140/sections/401/reviews/4213-JITENDRA-MOHANTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4213-JITENDRA-MOHANTY", "first_name": "JITENDRA", "last_name": "MOHANTY", "id": "4213-JITENDRA-MOHANTY", "name": "JITENDRA MOHANTY"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "15140-401-4213-JITENDRA-MOHANTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-150", "path": "/courses/15140", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15140/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO INDIAN PHILOS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-150-401", "path": "/courses/15140/sections/401", "id": "15140-401", "aliases": ["SAST-150-401", "RELS-155-401", "PHIL-050-401"]}]}, "id": 15140, "aliases": ["SAST-150", "RELS-155", "PHIL-050"]}
