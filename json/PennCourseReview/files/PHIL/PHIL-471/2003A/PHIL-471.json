{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1441"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the basic problems of the theory of action: What is an action? What makes actions different from (mere) events? How is the notion of action related to what people do intentionally? To what they intend to do? In addressing these questions, we will devote particular attention to the influential writings of Elizabeth Anscombe and Donald Davidson. In this connection we will consider the relation of these questions to the classic dabate about whether reasons can be causes. As we shall see, Davidson transformed the theory of action with his suggestion that an event is an action just in case there is a true description of it under which it was someone's doing something for a reason. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ACTION THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2058/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.75", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ACTION THEORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-471-301", "path": "/courses/2058/sections/301", "id": "2058-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-471-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/2058/sections/301/reviews/1929-CLAIRE-FINKELSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1929-CLAIRE-FINKELSTEIN", "first_name": "CLAIRE", "last_name": "FINKELSTEIN", "id": "1929-CLAIRE-FINKELSTEIN", "name": "CLAIRE FINKELSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "2058-301-1929-CLAIRE-FINKELSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-471", "path": "/courses/2058", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2058/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACTION THEORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-471-301", "path": "/courses/2058/sections/301", "id": "2058-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-471-301"]}]}, "id": 2058, "aliases": ["PHIL-471"]}
