{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5257"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the field of formal epistemology. Although some formal methods will be used, the principal objective is to explore various conceptual issues arising in modeling and representing knowledge. Topics include: bridging the gap between mainstream and formal epistemology by exploring various versions of the familiar tripartite definition of knowledge (knowledge as justified true belief) in light of folksy examples and counterexamples, basic logical and probabilistic models of knowledge (Hintikka, Aumann, and Bayesian) and their multi-agent variants, logical omniscience and other problems (including the epistemic closure principle), attempts at formalizing joint and common knowledge, resource-bounded knowledge, knowledge under limited logical powers, and empirical knowledge obstructed by system complexity. There are no prerequisites for this course, except some logical maturity. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE: FORMAL EPISTEMOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24965/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.82", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "1.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE: FORMAL EPISTEMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-431-301", "path": "/courses/24965/sections/301", "id": "24965-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-431-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/24965/sections/301/reviews/954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR", "first_name": "ZOLTAN", "last_name": "DOMOTOR", "id": "954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR", "name": "ZOLTAN DOMOTOR"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "24965-301-954-ZOLTAN-DOMOTOR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-431", "path": "/courses/24965", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24965/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE: FORMAL EPISTEMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-431-301", "path": "/courses/24965/sections/301", "id": "24965-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-431-301"]}]}, "id": 24965, "aliases": ["PHIL-431"]}
