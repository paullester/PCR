{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4103"}, "description": "Contemporary public discourse -- in politics, in the media, on the Internet, and throughout our culture -- gives expression to intense, sometimes violent, disagreements and conflicts that often frustrate the solution of important public policy questions, curtail productive public deliberation and dialogue, and profoundly challenge our leaders and institutions. This course will deepen our understanding of the role that political and cultural ideologies -- such as liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, totalitarianism, fundamentalism, etc. -- play in these conflicts and the psychology of ideological thinking that makes them so difficult to resolve. \n\nWe will begin by considering a series of case studies in contemporary political, social and cultural conflict, drawn from contemporary events such as the 2012 political campaigns, the 2011 debt ceiling debate in Congress, nationalist movements around the globe, etc. We will identify and examine the ideologies driving such conflicts, and from these we will draw out the common philosophical characteristics and psychological features of ideological thinking. Throughout, we will seek to understand the deep attraction of ideological commitments and why they tend to push public discourse and behavior to extremes and even violence. Finally, we will consider efforts to reduce or resolve ideological conflicts thorugh strategies of political compromise, dialogue, toleration, and democratic deliberation. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ETHN,IDENT,NATIONHOOD: Ideological Conflict and Public Discourse", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15005/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "ETHN,IDENT,NATIONHOOD: Ideological Conflict and Public Discourse", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "PHIL-489-640", "path": "/courses/15005/sections/640", "id": "15005-640", "aliases": ["PHIL-489-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/15005/sections/640/reviews/957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "first_name": "STEPHEN P", "last_name": "STEINBERG", "id": "957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG", "name": "STEPHEN P STEINBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "15005-640-957-STEPHEN-P-STEINBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-489", "path": "/courses/15005", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15005/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHN,IDENT,NATIONHOOD: Ideological Conflict and Public Discourse", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "PHIL-489-640", "path": "/courses/15005/sections/640", "id": "15005-640", "aliases": ["PHIL-489-640"]}]}, "id": 15005, "aliases": ["PHIL-489"]}
