{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5464"}, "description": "Taking our perceptual experience as a given, what causes it? In a realistic mood, we accept that objects in the environment, or in the \"external world,\" cause us to have the perceptual experiences that we do (as of a table with food, or as of a garden with flowers in it). Yet on this realistic view, our perception is the result of a causal chain that leads from object to eye to brain to experiences, and we are only given the last element: the experience. So how do we really know how our experiences are caused, and where do we get the idea that they are casued by an external world of physical objects? The seminar will focus on the problem of the external world as examined by David Hume, Thomas Reid, G. E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell, along with recent authors. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "PHIL OF PERCEPTION: Problem of External World", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27991/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL OF PERCEPTION: Problem of External World", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-330-301", "path": "/courses/27991/sections/301", "id": "27991-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-330-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/27991/sections/301/reviews/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "first_name": "GARY", "last_name": "HATFIELD", "id": "1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "name": "GARY HATFIELD"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "27991-301-1671-GARY-HATFIELD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-330", "path": "/courses/27991", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27991/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL OF PERCEPTION: Problem of External World", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-330-301", "path": "/courses/27991/sections/301", "id": "27991-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-330-301"]}]}, "id": 27991, "aliases": ["PHIL-330"]}
