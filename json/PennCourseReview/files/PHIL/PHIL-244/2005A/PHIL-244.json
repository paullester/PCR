We'll tackle this question by contrasting human minds with both the operations of computers and the cognitive activities of other animals; and by contrasting theoretical speculation with empirical investigation. Could a computer ever hold a real conversation, or experience what it's like to see red? If not, why are we so different? Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls, to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires. If not, how should we understand what goes on in their heads? \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10844/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.87", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.20", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-601", "path": "/courses/10844/sections/601", "id": "10844-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/10844/sections/601/reviews/943-GARY-PURPURA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/943-GARY-PURPURA", "first_name": "GARY", "last_name": "PURPURA", "id": "943-GARY-PURPURA", "name": "GARY PURPURA"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "10844-601-943-GARY-PURPURA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-244", "path": "/courses/10844", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10844/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-001", "path": "/courses/10844/sections/001", "id": "10844-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-001"]}, {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-601", "path": "/courses/10844/sections/601", "id": "10844-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-601"]}]}, "id": 10844, "aliases": ["PHIL-244"]}
