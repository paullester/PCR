Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls, to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires. If not, how should we understand what goes on in their heads? \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5741/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.32", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05", "rReadingsValue": "2.68", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.32", "rCommAbility": "3.21", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-301", "path": "/courses/5741/sections/301", "id": "5741-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/5741/sections/301/reviews/2015-MORGAN-WALLHAGEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2015-MORGAN-WALLHAGEN", "first_name": "MORGAN", "last_name": "WALLHAGEN", "id": "2015-MORGAN-WALLHAGEN", "name": "MORGAN WALLHAGEN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "5741-301-2015-MORGAN-WALLHAGEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-244", "path": "/courses/5741", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5741/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-301", "path": "/courses/5741/sections/301", "id": "5741-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-301"]}]}, "id": 5741, "aliases": ["PHIL-244"]}
