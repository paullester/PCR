{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1434"}, "description": "What is a mind? What is special about human minds? We'll tackle this question by contrasting human minds with both the operations of computers and the cognitive activities of other animals; and by contrasting theoretical speculation with empirical investigation. Could a computer ever hold a real conversation, or experience what it's like to see red? If not, why are we so different? Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls, to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires. If not, how should we understand what goes on in their heads? \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17901/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.42", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "3.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-401", "path": "/courses/17901/sections/401", "id": "17901-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-401", "VLST-244-401", "PPE-244-401"]}, "comments": "This course investigates the nature of the human mind from a philosophical perspective by contrasting human minds with computers and other animals. The class explores questions such as: What is required for something to count as a thinker? What is the best model for understanding the representational contents and processes of thought? Do all minds have conscious experiences? Where are minds located: in the brain, the body, or extended into the world? Readings are drawn from philosophy, cognitive science, and empirical psychology.\r\nStudents agreed that this was a well-taught and interesting course with a lot of \u201cstimulating discussion.\u201d Content included \u201ccomplex arguments\u201d and \u201crather dense material,\u201d making it very \u201cconceptually difficult.\u201d However, the \u201csensible\u201d course structure and stellar instruction helped break the surface of tough readings. Recitations and discussion board assignments help to keep students keep up with and understand the readings. In sum, \u201cthe course was excellent in every regard.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents commented that Professor Camp is a \u201cfantastic lecturer\u201d whose \u201centertaining and engaging lecture style\u201d was enjoyed by all. She succeeded in making the course\u2019s daunting material easy and \u201ca lot of fun to learn,\u201d often using examples to help clarify the difficult readings. Through her \u201cenergy and obvious enthusiasm,\u201d Professor Camp made each lecture \u201cinteresting and accessible.\u201d She was also available during office hours to further discuss course material.&#8232;\r\n&#8232;Although the readings were tough, they were compensated for by the helpful, clear instruction. This would be an excellent course for anyone interested in the \u201cworkings of the mind\u201d and in the fine line \u201cbetween humanity and the rest of the world.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/17901/sections/401/reviews/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "first_name": "ELISABETH MAURA", "last_name": "CAMP", "id": "3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "name": "ELISABETH MAURA CAMP"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "17901-401-3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-244", "path": "/courses/17901", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17901/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF MIND", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-244-401", "path": "/courses/17901/sections/401", "id": "17901-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-244-401", "VLST-244-401", "PPE-244-401"]}]}, "id": 17901, "aliases": ["PHIL-244", "VLST-244", "PPE-244"]}
