The course material contrasts mental lives with the cognitive activities of non-human animals and with the operations of computers. Do either animals or computers have beliefs, desires, and experiences? If they do, do they also have the same ethical rights and responsibilities as humans? If they don\\'t, does this cast any doubt on the reality of our own mental lives? Throughout, students will contrast philosophical arguments with empirical findings in psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed the course material in the class and found the subject \u201cinteresting.\u201d One student wrote that \u201cthe readings covered a breadth of subjects while remaining focused. Another student, however, found that there \u201cwas little continuity in the curriculum.\u201d Most felt that they had challenged themselves intellectually and improved their reasoning skills.\r\n\r\nStudents found that Professor Horowitz was an \u201cexcellent professor.\u201d He was very accessible and willing to speak with students \u201cabout questions, paper topics, etc, and he was very adept at explaining tricky concepts so that everyone in the class could understand them.\u201d Another student wrote that he had an ability to \u201cencourage even those students with no background or interest in philosophy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of this course seemed to depend on whether the student has a background in philosophy. One student that had little background in philosophy wrote that \u201cthe content is quite difficult.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cI would not recommend the course to anyone without a decent background in philosophy who is willing to step up to the conceptually difficult readings.\u201d The amount of work was moderate and included participation, reading responses, and two papers. This course was strongly recommended to majors and recommended somewhat less strongly to non-majors.", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/16302/sections/401/reviews/4524-DAMON-HOROWITZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4524-DAMON-HOROWITZ", "first_name": "DAMON", "last_name": "HOROWITZ", "id": "4524-DAMON-HOROWITZ", "name": "DAMON HOROWITZ"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "16302-401-4524-DAMON-HOROWITZ"}]
