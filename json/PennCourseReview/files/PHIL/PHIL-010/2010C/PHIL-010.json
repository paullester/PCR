{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5145"}, "description": "Topics in Philosophy: Philosophy through Great Books: In this seminar we will approach and examine different philosophical issues by reading some of the so-called \"great books\", including central western philosophy works by Plato, Descartes, Hobbes, and Mill as well as books like The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Bhagavad Gita, and The Analects. We read these canonical works because they are among the key and enduring works of humanity, and to learn how their authors understand and approach philosophical and practical problems that continue to confront us. Topics to be discussed include the idea of justice, what is the good life, the possibility and basis of knowledge, nature vs society, social obligations, and morality and conflict. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "TOPICS IN PHILOSOPHY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23614/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "2.31", "rRecommendMajor": "2.77", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN PHILOSOPHY I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-010-301", "path": "/courses/23614/sections/301", "id": "23614-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-010-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/23614/sections/301/reviews/1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "first_name": "KOK-CHOR", "last_name": "TAN", "id": "1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "name": "KOK-CHOR TAN"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "23614-301-1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-010", "path": "/courses/23614", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23614/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN PHILOSOPHY I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-010-301", "path": "/courses/23614/sections/301", "id": "23614-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-010-301"]}]}, "id": 23614, "aliases": ["PHIL-010"]}
