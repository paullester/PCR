{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2063"}, "description": "In this course, we will read closely some of the definitive texts of seventeenth century European philosophy, using the concept of the human being as our focal point. We will concentrate primarily on the human considered as a biological being (thus developing our understanding of the scientific advances of this century), as a conscious being (thus developing our understanding of theories of mind in this century), and (where relevant) as a moral being. We will focus our attention on Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, but draw as well upon texts from other thinkers, particularly Elisabeth, Malebranche and Cavendish. There will be two lectures per week, and discussion is strongly welcome. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "CONTINENTAL RATIONALISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30861/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "CONTINENTAL RATIONALISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-460-301", "path": "/courses/30861/sections/301", "id": "30861-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-460-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/30861/sections/301/reviews/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "first_name": "KAREN E.", "last_name": "DETLEFSEN", "id": "945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "name": "KAREN E.
