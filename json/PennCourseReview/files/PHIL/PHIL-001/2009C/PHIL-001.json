{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/867"}, "description": "Philosophers ask difficult questions about the most basic issues in human life. Does God exist? What does it mean to live a good life? How should I treat non-human animals? Do I have free will? How do I know that the world I see is really there? This course is an introduction to some of these questions and to the methods philosophers have developed for thinking clearly about them. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17888/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.05", "rWorkRequired": "2.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-001-001", "path": "/courses/17888/sections/001", "id": "17888-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-001-001"]}, "comments": "In this class, students examine core philosophical questions such as the underlying nature of reality, the scope and limits of human knowledge, and the existence of God.
