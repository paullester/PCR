{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1430"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to some of the central philosophical problems in the law. We will look at questions such as: What is the relationship between law and morality? Are we bound to obey laws that are immoral? What are the limits to liberty, and how can we balance liberty and equality? Are there limits to free speech and expression? Is affirmative action justifiable? Is capital punishment acceptable? To properly address these and other questions, we begin the course by looking at this fundamental question, \"What is law?\" We will read historical and contemporary philosophical writings about these issues, as well as some of the well-known court cases to motivate and to focus our discussion. Authors include Aquinas, Mill, Rawls, Hart, Dworkin and others. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF LAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16297/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "2.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.41", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "2.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "2.85"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF LAW", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-077-001", "path": "/courses/16297/sections/001", "id": "16297-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-077-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/16297/sections/001/reviews/1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "first_name": "KOK-CHOR", "last_name": "TAN", "id": "1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN", "name": "KOK-CHOR TAN"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "16297-001-1660-KOK-CHOR-TAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-077", "path": "/courses/16297", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16297/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF LAW", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-077-001", "path": "/courses/16297/sections/001", "id": "16297-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-077-001"]}]}, "id": 16297, "aliases": ["PHIL-077"]}
