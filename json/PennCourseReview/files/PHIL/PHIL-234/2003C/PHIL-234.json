{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2373"}, "description": "This course will focus on arguments for and against the existence of God. It will begin by examining the ontological, cosmological, and design arguments for the existence of God. Included will be a discussion of purported evidence for the existence of God from modern biology and cosmology. It will then examine arguments against the existence of God based on human and animal suffering, followed by arguments against the existence of God arising from the scarcity of credible miracle claims. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4547/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.61", "rDifficulty": "2.48", "rStimulateInterest": "2.64", "rRecommendMajor": "2.82", "rCourseQuality": "2.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.41", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "2.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.16", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-234-401", "path": "/courses/4547/sections/401", "id": "4547-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-234-401", "RELS-204-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/4547/sections/401/reviews/939-STEVEN-GROSS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/939-STEVEN-GROSS", "first_name": "STEVEN", "last_name": "GROSS", "id": "939-STEVEN-GROSS", "name": "STEVEN GROSS"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "4547-401-939-STEVEN-GROSS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-234", "path": "/courses/4547", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4547/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-234-401", "path": "/courses/4547/sections/401", "id": "4547-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-234-401", "RELS-204-401"]}]}, "id": 4547, "aliases": ["PHIL-234", "RELS-204"]}
