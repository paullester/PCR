Questions considered include: what it means to be a free agent and what it means to have a free will, the degree to which our beliefs about physical causality undermine our beliefs about agency, the nature and importance of moral responsibility, and the relationship between freedom and responsibility. Readings are drawn from both historical and contemporary sources.&#8232;&#8232;\r\nThis course is \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cfascinating,\u201d and \u201cone of the best academic experiences\u201d at Penn. The topic is \u201capplicable,\u201d \u201cthought-provoking,\u201d \u201cfun,\u201d and \u201cmind-twisting, in a great way.\u201d Assigned readings were \u201ctailored directly\u201d to course objectives and were well ordered. The summaries and critical reading project were helpful to students to get a thorough understanding of the material. The course ends with a final paper and take-home exam. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nProfessor Martin is an \u201cexcellent teacher and really made learning such a pleasure.\u201d All students expressed this sentiment; she was \u201cextremely knowledgeable\u201d yet able to communicate the subject matter in a way that was \u201caccessible to everyone.\u201d Professor Martin\u2019s lectures were \u201cclear and concise,\u201d articulating the material well and promoting \u201cintelligent-thought provoking discussions.\u201d Students thanked her for a \u201cfantastic semester\u201d and \u201cwould take any other course with the same instructor.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\nThis course is for anyone interested in philosophy or up for a new stimulating challenge. One student reported, \u201cThe way I thought about problems (of free will, responsibility, action, agency\u2026anything!) definitely seeped into all my other classes.\u201d Students thought the professor was \u201ca fair grader\u201d and did not assign too much work at any one time. Still, it was occasionally difficult to keep up with the reading, because there were new readings for \u201calmost every class,\u201d and students complained that the inclusion of both a \u201cfairly dense\u201d final paper and a \u201ctime-consuming\u201d final take-home exam was too much work.", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/16301/sections/301/reviews/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "first_name": "ADRIENNE M.", "last_name": "MARTIN", "id": "3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "name": "ADRIENNE M.
