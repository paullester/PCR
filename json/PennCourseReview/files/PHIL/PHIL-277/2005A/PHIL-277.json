{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1435"}, "description": "In this course we will focus on the philosophical background to questions regarding the exercise of legitimate political power and individuals' rights under the U.S. Constitution, including 1st Amendment freedoms of religion, expression, and association; the 14th amendment guarantee of Due Process and the right of privacy, abortion, euthanasia, and the right to marry; the Equal Protection clause and its bearing on affirmative action and equal political rights, and the Takings and Contract clauses and their bearing on rights of private property and economic freedom. We will also discuss competing conceptions of democracy and their implications for the purported authority of courts to reverse democratically enacted decisions by a majority. In addition to Supreme Court decisions concerning these and other issues, we will read works by J.S. Mill, John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, T.M. Scanlon, Martha Nussbaum, Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick, and other contemporary philosophers. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "JUSTICE, LAW & MORALITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10846/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "1.99", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.95", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "1.91", "rInstructorAccess": "2.68", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.21", "rCommAbility": "2.81", "rInstructorQuality": "2.69"}, "section": {"name": "JUSTICE, LAW & MORALITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-277-001", "path": "/courses/10846/sections/001", "id": "10846-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-277-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 89, "path": "/courses/10846/sections/001/reviews/1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "first_name": "ANITA L", "last_name": "ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "id": "1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO", "name": "ANITA L ALLEN-CASTELLITTO"}, "num_reviewers": 77, "id": "10846-001-1927-ANITA-L-ALLEN-CASTELLITTO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-277", "path": "/courses/10846", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10846/sections", "values": [{"name": "JUSTICE, LAW & MORALITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-277-001", "path": "/courses/10846/sections/001", "id": "10846-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-277-001"]}]}, "id": 10846, "aliases": ["PHIL-277"]}
