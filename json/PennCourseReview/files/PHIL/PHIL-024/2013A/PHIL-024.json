{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5716"}, "description": "Why was Darwin's theory of evolution revolutionary? What actually evolves: genes, individuals or groups? What factors other than natural selection determine evolution and how important are they? To what extent do genes affect our behavior? Does the race have a biological basis? What is biodiversity and why should we care about it? In this course we will examine these questions from a philosophical point of view. This course will have two parts. In the firsst part we will examine the foundations of evolutionary theory, starting off with Darwin's own formulation. We will then look at external and interal criticisms of evolutionary theory. Topics will include creationism and intelligent design, adaptationism, and the units of selection debate. In the second part of the course we will apply this knowledge to contemporary ethical issues. We will focus on biological theories of race and gender and examine their criticisms. We will also discuss the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory, the emergence of ecosystem ecology and the concept of biodiversity and its role in environmental policy. Please note that no previous knowledge of philosophy or biology is required to attend this course. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "PHIL OF BIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30846/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.56", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL OF BIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-024-301", "path": "/courses/30846/sections/301", "id": "30846-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-024-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/30846/sections/301/reviews/6572-ALKISTIS-ELLIOTT-GRAVES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6572-ALKISTIS-ELLIOTT-GRAVES", "first_name": "ALKISTIS", "last_name": "ELLIOTT-GRAVES", "id": "6572-ALKISTIS-ELLIOTT-GRAVES", "name": "ALKISTIS ELLIOTT-GRAVES"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "30846-301-6572-ALKISTIS-ELLIOTT-GRAVES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-024", "path": "/courses/30846", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30846/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL OF BIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-024-301", "path": "/courses/30846/sections/301", "id": "30846-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-024-301"]}]}, "id": 30846, "aliases": ["PHIL-024"]}
