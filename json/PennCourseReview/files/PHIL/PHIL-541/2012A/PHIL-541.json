{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5016"}, "description": "Seminar in Metaphysics: What Exists? In this seminar we will try to devise a list of entities that are metaphysically fundamental -- no small task. One route in will be via examining, and reacting to, a very mainstream metaphysical system: the metaphysical system of the proponents of \"Humean Supervenience,\" (e.g., David Lewis, Barry Loewer). This project takes laws of nature, causation and dispositions as being non-fundamental. We will also strive to craft a fundamental ontology through considering the following issues: how contemporary physics informs metaphysics, whether there really is a meaningful physical/non-physical distinction, whether reality is informational, and the nature of mind and consciousness. (Readings include a book by Ladyman and Ross, Everything Must Go, as well as articles/chapters by Chalmers, Armstrong, Maudlin and others). \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "TOPICS IN METAPHYSICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27998/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN METAPHYSICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-541-301", "path": "/courses/27998/sections/301", "id": "27998-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-541-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/27998/sections/301/reviews/3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER", "first_name": "SUSAN", "last_name": "SCHNEIDER", "id": "3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER", "name": "SUSAN SCHNEIDER"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "27998-301-3457-SUSAN-SCHNEIDER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-541", "path": "/courses/27998", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27998/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN METAPHYSICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-541-301", "path": "/courses/27998/sections/301", "id": "27998-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-541-301"]}]}, "id": 27998, "aliases": ["PHIL-541"]}
