{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5349"}, "description": "In this class we will explore the various kinds of things that get called \"meaning,\" from the most basic informational correlations (as when we say that smoke means fire, or that the tree's having 30 rings means that it is 30 years old), to the conventional meaning of sentences in a language, and on to the most open-ended, complex forms of cultural significance (as when we talk about what a movie means to us). What determines something's meaning: the creator or the recipient? Can all of these kinds of meaning be considered true or false? If somehting is meaningful, must there always be a determinate answer about what it means? This class should be accessible to anyone with a bit of backround in philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, literature or cultural criticism. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "WHAT IS MEANING?", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26603/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.65", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "WHAT IS MEANING?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-205-301", "path": "/courses/26603/sections/301", "id": "26603-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-205-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/26603/sections/301/reviews/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "first_name": "ELISABETH MAURA", "last_name": "CAMP", "id": "3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "name": "ELISABETH MAURA CAMP"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "26603-301-3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-205", "path": "/courses/26603", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26603/sections", "values": [{"name": "WHAT IS MEANING?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-205-301", "path": "/courses/26603/sections/301", "id": "26603-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-205-301"]}]}, "id": 26603, "aliases": ["PHIL-205"]}
