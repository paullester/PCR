{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5350"}, "description": "Martin Heidegger was one of the most influential, and most contested, philosophers of the twentieth century. His book \"Being and Time\" is a classic of contemporary thinking, and his critique of technology provided the conceptual foundations for a general critique of modernity. In this course, we will read and discuss large parts of \"Being and Time\" as well as several of the essays devoted to the problem of technology, with a special emphasis on the ontological, rather than the existentialist, strand in Heidegger's thinking. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HEIDEGGER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26608/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "HEIDEGGER", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-355-301", "path": "/courses/26608/sections/301", "id": "26608-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-355-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/26608/sections/301/reviews/4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS", "first_name": "GUNNAR", "last_name": "HINDRICHS", "id": "4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS", "name": "GUNNAR HINDRICHS"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "26608-301-4525-GUNNAR-HINDRICHS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-355", "path": "/courses/26608", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26608/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEIDEGGER", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-355-301", "path": "/courses/26608/sections/301", "id": "26608-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-355-301"]}]}, "id": 26608, "aliases": ["PHIL-355"]}
