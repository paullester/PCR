{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5718"}, "description": "An intensive research seminar for undergraduates, aimed at developing philosophical skills in the context of a supportive student community. Students will learn to present, discuss, and write philosophy, drawing on canonical texts in a range of philosophical areas and methods, along with readings which they identify in the course of articulating their own philosophical interests. The course may be taken alone or as part of a two-semester sequence, and with or without a stand-alone honors thesis. In addition to philosophy majors, the course is also suitable for less advanced students or majors in related fields who want to sharpen their analytic skills. Admission is by application only. Students should have demonstrated philosophical interest and ability, whether through past enrollment in upper-division philosophy courses or through other means; and should submit a transcript, the names of 1-2 supporting faculty, and a brief statement (300 words) describing how they expect the course to contribute to their philosophical and intellectual development, to Professor Karen Detlefsen (detlefse@sas.upenn.edu) by November 2, 2012. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "RESEARCH METHODS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30855/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.64", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "3.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "RESEARCH METHODS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-300-301", "path": "/courses/30855/sections/301", "id": "30855-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-300-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/30855/sections/301/reviews/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "first_name": "ELISABETH MAURA", "last_name": "CAMP", "id": "3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "name": "ELISABETH MAURA CAMP"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "30855-301-3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-300", "path": "/courses/30855", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30855/sections", "values": [{"name": "RESEARCH METHODS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-300-301", "path": "/courses/30855/sections/301", "id": "30855-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-300-301"]}]}, "id": 30855, "aliases": ["PHIL-300"]}
