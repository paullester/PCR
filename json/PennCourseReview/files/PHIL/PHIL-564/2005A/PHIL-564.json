{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3682"}, "description": "This course will study the reception of Kant's theoretical philosophy in the twentieth century, particularly after 1950, when Kant came to be seen as central to the critique of the original project of analytic philosophy as exemplified by such figures as Russell, the early Wittgenstein, and Carnap. After a brief review of the beginnings of post-analytic philosophy in Quine's and White's rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction, we will look at the appropriation of Kant in such figures as Peter Strawson, Wilfrid Sellars, Hilary Putnam, and John McDowell. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "POST-KANTIAN EPISTEMOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10858/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.78", "rDifficulty": "3.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.89", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "3.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "3.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "POST-KANTIAN EPISTEMOL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-564-301", "path": "/courses/10858/sections/301", "id": "10858-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-564-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/10858/sections/301/reviews/1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "first_name": "PAUL D", "last_name": "GUYER", "id": "1670-PAUL-D-GUYER", "name": "PAUL D GUYER"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "10858-301-1670-PAUL-D-GUYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-564", "path": "/courses/10858", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10858/sections", "values": [{"name": "POST-KANTIAN EPISTEMOL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-564-301", "path": "/courses/10858/sections/301", "id": "10858-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-564-301"]}]}, "id": 10858, "aliases": ["PHIL-564"]}
