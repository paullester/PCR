{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3481"}, "description": "The aim of this course is to investigate the philosophical background of our constitutional democracy. What is the appropriate role and limits of majority legislative rule? How are we to understand First Amendment protections of freedom of religion, speech, and assembly? What is the conception of equality that underlies the l4th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause? Is there a right of privacy implicit in the Constitution? Do rights of property deserve the same degree of protection as other constitutional rights? To investigate these and other constitutional issues, we will read from both Supreme Court opinions and relevant philosophical texts. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "PHIL & THE CONSTITUTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9399/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL & THE CONSTITUTION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-377-301", "path": "/courses/9399/sections/301", "id": "9399-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-377-301", "PPE-377-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/9399/sections/301/reviews/947-SAMUEL-R--FREEMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/947-SAMUEL-R--FREEMAN", "first_name": "SAMUEL R.", "last_name": "FREEMAN", "id": "947-SAMUEL-R--FREEMAN", "name": "SAMUEL R.
