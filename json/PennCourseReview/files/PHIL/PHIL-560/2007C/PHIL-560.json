{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3919"}, "description": "In this course, we will undertake an intensive study of the thought of Descartes, one of philosophy's most important figures. We will read his major works - Rules for the Direction of the Mind, The World, Discourse on Method, Meditation on First Philosophy, Principles of Philosophy, and Passions of the Soul - as well as some less well-known works and some of his correspondence. We will study his ideas on method and epistemology, metaphysics, physics and the life sciences, medicine, the nature of the human being, and value theory. While our primary aim will be to understand his philosophy as a whole and how his thoughts developed and changed through his life, we will devote some time to evaluating his legacy. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "DESCARTES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13737/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "DESCARTES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-560-301", "path": "/courses/13737/sections/301", "id": "13737-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-560-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/13737/sections/301/reviews/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "first_name": "KAREN E.", "last_name": "DETLEFSEN", "id": "945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "name": "KAREN E.
