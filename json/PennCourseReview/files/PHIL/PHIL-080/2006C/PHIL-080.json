{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/877"}, "description": "Philosophy of Art: What is art? How does it differ from real life? How can representations of fictional events produce real emotions? Why do we enjoy or even love the artistic presentation of events that we would find repellent or abhorrent in reality? These are just a few of the questions that the artistic genre of tragedy has raised for philosophers since the beginning of philosophy in ancient Greece. This course will introduce many of the questions of aesthetics by focussing on philosophical theories of tragedy from Plato to the present. In addition to Plato, other writers to be discussed will include Aristotle, Hume, Kames, Rousseau, Schiller, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Bullough, and contemporary writers such as Stanley Cavell, Kendall Walton, Noel Carroll, Jenefer Robinson, and Martha Nussbaum. We will also test philosophical theories against samples of work by tragedians such as Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy. Grades will be based on three written exercises (5 to 7 pages) and classroom participation. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "AESTHETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9392/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.31", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "2.66", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.84", "rCommAbility": "2.81", "rInstructorQuality": "2.97"}, "section": {"name": "AESTHETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-080-001", "path": "/courses/9392/sections/001", "id": "9392-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-080-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/9392/sections/001/reviews/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "first_name": "ELISABETH MAURA", "last_name": "CAMP", "id": "3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "name": "ELISABETH MAURA CAMP"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "9392-001-3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-080", "path": "/courses/9392", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9392/sections", "values": [{"name": "AESTHETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-080-001", "path": "/courses/9392/sections/001", "id": "9392-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-080-001"]}]}, "id": 9392, "aliases": ["PHIL-080"]}
