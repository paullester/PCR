{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/877"}, "description": "This course addresses philosophical issues arising from the nature and value of the arts. We examine such questions as the following: When is an experience aesthetic? Why are such experiences supposed to be valuable? Is there only one correct interpretation of an artwork or may multiple interpretations be equally acceptable? If a painting and a forgery are visually indistinguishable, can one be more valuable (aesthetically, artistically) than the other? Is artistic value different from aesthetic value? Why are emotional responses to art important? Can the view that the arts are among the most valuable products of human culture be sustained? Lecture and discussion will center around classic historical and influential contemporary texts in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "AESTHETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30850/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "3.19", "rWorkRequired": "1.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "AESTHETICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-080-301", "path": "/courses/30850/sections/301", "id": "30850-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-080-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/30850/sections/301/reviews/6574-WIEBKE-DEIMLING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6574-WIEBKE-DEIMLING", "first_name": "WIEBKE", "last_name": "DEIMLING", "id": "6574-WIEBKE-DEIMLING", "name": "WIEBKE DEIMLING"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "30850-301-6574-WIEBKE-DEIMLING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-080", "path": "/courses/30850", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30850/sections", "values": [{"name": "AESTHETICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-080-301", "path": "/courses/30850/sections/301", "id": "30850-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-080-301"]}]}, "id": 30850, "aliases": ["PHIL-080"]}
