{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2061"}, "description": "The course will focus on the development of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics from the late nineteenth-century thorugh the present day. Topics will include logicism, formalism, intuitionism, and the foundations of set theory. Ample consideration will be given to some of the fundamental results of mathematical logic, such as the Godel incompleteness theorems and the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis from Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, that have had a profound impact on contemporary approaches to the philosophy of mathematics. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "PHIL OF MATH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22277/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "1.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.44", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL OF MATH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-414-301", "path": "/courses/22277/sections/301", "id": "22277-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-414-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/22277/sections/301/reviews/946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "first_name": "SCOTT", "last_name": "WEINSTEIN", "id": "946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "name": "SCOTT WEINSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "22277-301-946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-414", "path": "/courses/22277", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22277/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL OF MATH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-414-301", "path": "/courses/22277/sections/301", "id": "22277-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-414-301"]}]}, "id": 22277, "aliases": ["PHIL-414"]}
