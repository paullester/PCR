The course will include an introduction to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and examine the subsequent development of modern philosophic existentialism by critics of Husserl, such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre or Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Finally, the important influence of phenomenology and existentialism on contemporary trends in French, German, and American philosophy will be explored, including hermeneutics, deconstruction, post-modernism, and post-analytic philosophy. No previous study of philosophy is required. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "CONTEM CONT PHIL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8198/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "3.09", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.91", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.18", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEM CONT PHIL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-054-001", "path": "/courses/8198/sections/001", "id": "8198-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-054-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/8198/sections/001/reviews/3144-AMMON-MERRILL-ALLRED", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3144-AMMON-MERRILL-ALLRED", "first_name": "AMMON MERRILL", "last_name": "ALLRED", "id": "3144-AMMON-MERRILL-ALLRED", "name": "AMMON MERRILL ALLRED"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "8198-001-3144-AMMON-MERRILL-ALLRED"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-054", "path": "/courses/8198", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8198/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEM CONT PHIL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-054-001", "path": "/courses/8198/sections/001", "id": "8198-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-054-001"]}]}, "id": 8198, "aliases": ["PHIL-054"]}
