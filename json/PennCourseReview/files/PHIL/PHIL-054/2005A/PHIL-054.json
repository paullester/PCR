The course will include an introduction to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and examine the subsequent development of modern philosophic existentialism by critics of Husserl, such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre or Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Finally, the important influence of phenomenology and existentialism on contemporary trends in French, German, and American philosophy will be explored, including hermeneutics, deconstruction, post-modernism, and post-analytic philosophy. No previous study of philosophy is required. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "CONTEM CONT PHIL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10841/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEM CONT PHIL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-054-001", "path": "/courses/10841/sections/001", "id": "10841-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-054-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/10841/sections/001/reviews/2650-FARHANG-ERFANI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2650-FARHANG-ERFANI", "first_name": "FARHANG", "last_name": "ERFANI", "id": "2650-FARHANG-ERFANI", "name": "FARHANG ERFANI"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "10841-001-2650-FARHANG-ERFANI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-054", "path": "/courses/10841", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10841/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEM CONT PHIL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-054-001", "path": "/courses/10841/sections/001", "id": "10841-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-054-001"]}]}, "id": 10841, "aliases": ["PHIL-054"]}
