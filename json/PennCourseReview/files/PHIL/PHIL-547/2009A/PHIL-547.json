{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/887"}, "description": "In this course, we will read some seminal texts in the transformation of natural philosophy (a predecessor to contemporary science) in Britain in the early modern period. Our thinkers will include (among others) Bacon, Boyle, Harvey and Newton. In addition to understanding some key features of these thinkers' natural philosophy, we will discuss the oft-mentioned (and recently much questioned) notion of the early modern Scientific Revolution: were these and other figures really part of a radical transformation in scientific thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? Related, we will look at the transformations occurring not just in what we would now call physics, But also in the life sciences. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "LEIBNIZ/LOCKE: LEIBNIZ", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16310/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "LEIBNIZ/LOCKE: LEIBNIZ", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-547-301", "path": "/courses/16310/sections/301", "id": "16310-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-547-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/16310/sections/301/reviews/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "first_name": "KAREN E.", "last_name": "DETLEFSEN", "id": "945-KAREN-E--DETLEFSEN", "name": "KAREN E.
