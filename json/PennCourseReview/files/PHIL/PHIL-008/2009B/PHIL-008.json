{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/872"}, "description": "This is an introductory course in modern political philosophy. Political philosophy addresses the justification and legitimate purposes of political power; the basic rights of individuals; the justification of property; capitalism vs. socialism vs. the welfare state; economic justice and the fair distribution of income and wealth; the constitutional requirements of a democracy; and the meaning of the freedom and equality of citizens. These are the kinds of questions we will investigate. The course is organized around the social contract tradition in political philosophy and the utilitarian response to it. Our primary focus is the works of the major social contract philosophers--Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and John Rawls--and the major utilitarian philosophers--David Hume, Adam Smith, Jeremy Benthams, and John Stuart Mill. Karl Marx is discussed as a critic of capitalism and constitutional democracy. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "THE SOCIAL CONTRACT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16813/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.70", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "THE SOCIAL CONTRACT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "PHIL-008-910", "path": "/courses/16813/sections/910", "id": "16813-910", "aliases": ["PHIL-008-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/16813/sections/910/reviews/4702-DOUGLAS-PALETTA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4702-DOUGLAS-PALETTA", "first_name": "DOUGLAS", "last_name": "PALETTA", "id": "4702-DOUGLAS-PALETTA", "name": "DOUGLAS PALETTA"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "16813-910-4702-DOUGLAS-PALETTA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-008", "path": "/courses/16813", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16813/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE SOCIAL CONTRACT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "PHIL-008-910", "path": "/courses/16813/sections/910", "id": "16813-910", "aliases": ["PHIL-008-910"]}]}, "id": 16813, "aliases": ["PHIL-008"]}
