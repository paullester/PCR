{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/872"}, "description": "This is an introductory course in modern political philosophy. Political philosophy addresses the justification and legitimate purposes of political power; the basic rights of individuals; the justification of property; capitalism vs. socialism vs. the welfare state; economic justice and the fair distribution of income and wealth; the constitutional requirements of a democracy; and the meaning of the freedom and equality of citizens. These are the kinds of questions we will investigate. The course is organized around the social contract tradition in political philosophy and the utilitarian response to it. Our primary focus is the works of the major social contract philosophers--Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and John Rawls--and the major utilitarian philosophers--David Hume, Adam Smith, Jeremy Benthams, and John Stuart Mill. Karl Marx is discussed as a critic of capitalism and constitutional democracy. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "THE SOCIAL CONTRACT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26597/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "1.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.51", "rInstructorAccess": "2.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.94", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "THE SOCIAL CONTRACT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-008-401", "path": "/courses/26597/sections/401", "id": "26597-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-008-401", "PPE-008-401"]}, "comments": "This course examined the history and significance of social contract doctrine for modern social and political thought. In particular, students studied the works of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Rousseau, and of utilitarian critics of social contract doctrine, namely David Hume, Adam Smith, J.S. Mill, and Karl Marx. This course thus serves as an introduction to many of the major figures in modern political philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the class structure, students\u2019 responses were mixed. While some students stated that the slides shown in class were \u201cnot very informative,\u201d some students found them useful. Because the slides were not available on blackboard, some students spent more time \u201ccopying what was on the slides than absorbing the materials in class.\u201d Overall, students still found the class \u201crewarding and useful.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Tan as \u201cknowledgeable\u201d and \u201cthoughtful.\u201d According to students, he paused in class to allow time for questions, and \u201che took time to learn the names of the participating students in the 100+ class.\u201d His passion for teaching was clear to many students as well.
