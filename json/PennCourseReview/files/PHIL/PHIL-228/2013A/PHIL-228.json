{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4381"}, "description": "This course explores some crucial foundational issues of contemporary social science. It focuses on various types of explanation, the construction of social models, and their validation. Specific topics will include: 1. Rational choice models (including game-theoretic ones) and alternative models of bounded rationality; 2. Experimental models in economics and psychology and whether they present a radical departure from traditional economic models; 3. Evolutionary models of the emergence of institutions, and agent-based simulations of such dynamics. In particular, we will explore theoretical and empirical models of trust, reciprocity, cooperation and fairness, asking what motivates individuals to engage in pro-social behavior and how such behavior can emerge and persist. This course will cover some of the material presented in other Core courses, with particular attention to foundational and explanatory issues that are not usually discussed in a typical social science course. Prerequisites: Students must have taken, ECON 001, ECON 002, PSCI 182, PPE 153 and PPE 201. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "PHIL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30851/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.37", "rTAQuality": "3.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.34", "rCourseQuality": "2.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.03", "rInstructorQuality": "2.59", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "2.42"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-228-401", "path": "/courses/30851/sections/401", "id": "30851-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-228-401", "PPE-204-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 86, "path": "/courses/30851/sections/401/reviews/2651-CRISTINA-BICCHIERI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2651-CRISTINA-BICCHIERI", "first_name": "CRISTINA", "last_name": "BICCHIERI", "id": "2651-CRISTINA-BICCHIERI", "name": "CRISTINA BICCHIERI"}, "num_reviewers": 72, "id": "30851-401-2651-CRISTINA-BICCHIERI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-228", "path": "/courses/30851", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30851/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-228-401", "path": "/courses/30851/sections/401", "id": "30851-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-228-401", "PPE-204-401"]}]}, "id": 30851, "aliases": ["PHIL-228", "PPE-204"]}
