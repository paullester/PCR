It focused on the nature of social systems, the similarities and differences between social and natural sciences, the construction, analysis, and confirmation of social theories, and the nature of social explanations. Students were expected to construct and analyze simple computational models of social phenomena.

Many students found that the format of the test failed to display their understanding of the material. Although students thought grading was \u201csometimes subjective,\u201d they were not given \u201cfeedback or opportunities to improve.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Weisberg, according to students, is \u201cvery passionate and does an excellent job conveying the material.\u201d He was very engaging in lectures, and \u201cavailable for help outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nStudents stated that the course \u201crequires a real commitment from the student.\u201d There were a lot of dense assigned readings, and some found them to be irrelevant to the course material sometimes. \u201cBecause students are held to a very high standard in class evaluation,\u201d students did not recommend this class to non-major students.", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/26604/sections/401/reviews/2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "WEISBERG", "id": "2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "name": "MICHAEL WEISBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 62, "id": "26604-401-2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG"}]
