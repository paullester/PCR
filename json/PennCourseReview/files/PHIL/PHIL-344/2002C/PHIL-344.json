{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2060"}, "description": "In this class, we will engage in a close reading of Wittgenstein's major writings: the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations. Some of the main topics to be considered include: how languagerelates to the world; what philosophy is and what it can accomplish; the nature of understanding; what is involved in following a rule; and the phenomenon of seeing-as. \n\nA distinctive feature of Wittgenstein's approach to philosoph is his commitment to philosophy as an activity rather than a set of doctrines. In keeping with this, the main goal of this class is for you to learn to do philosophy: to read closely, to grapple with foundational questions, and to talk seriously with others. This class is very much a seminar, and I will avoid lecturing as much as possible. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "WITTGENSTEIN:MIND & LANG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3361/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.87", "rDifficulty": "3.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "3.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.07"}, "section": {"name": "WITTGENSTEIN:MIND & LANG", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-344-301", "path": "/courses/3361/sections/301", "id": "3361-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-344-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/3361/sections/301/reviews/1667-THOMAS-G-RICKETTS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1667-THOMAS-G-RICKETTS", "first_name": "THOMAS G", "last_name": "RICKETTS", "id": "1667-THOMAS-G-RICKETTS", "name": "THOMAS G RICKETTS"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "3361-301-1667-THOMAS-G-RICKETTS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-344", "path": "/courses/3361", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3361/sections", "values": [{"name": "WITTGENSTEIN:MIND & LANG", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-344-301", "path": "/courses/3361/sections/301", "id": "3361-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-344-301"]}]}, "id": 3361, "aliases": ["PHIL-344"]}
