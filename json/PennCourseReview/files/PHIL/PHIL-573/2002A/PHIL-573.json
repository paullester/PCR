{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/888"}, "description": "This course will focus on several conceptual issues in bioethics and philosophy of medicine. It is intended to be a graduate level seminar for students in bioethics, philosophy, medicine or related fields. Issues to be covered include: the role of underdetermination and incommensurability in medical science; the meaning and significance of the concepts of health and disease; the distinction between genetic and non-genetic diseases; and problems in genetic technology associated with reductionism and causality. This course will explore the intersection between philosophy of science and bioethics. Some of the most important ethical and social issues and even policy decisions hinge on often unexamined conceptual grounds. We will critically examine some of the crucial assumptions which underlie contemporary biomedical practice. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CONCEPT FOUNDA BIOETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/888/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "CONCEPT FOUNDA BIOETHICS", "sectionnum": "690", "primary_alias": "PHIL-573-690", "path": "/courses/888/sections/690", "id": "888-690", "aliases": ["PHIL-573-690"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/888/sections/690/reviews/958-DAVID-C--MAGNUS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/958-DAVID-C--MAGNUS", "first_name": "DAVID C.", "last_name": "MAGNUS", "id": "958-DAVID-C--MAGNUS", "name": "DAVID C.
