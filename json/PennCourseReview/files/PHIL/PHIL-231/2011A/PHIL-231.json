{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2372"}, "description": "Knowledge is something that we seek to acquire not only in philosophy, but also in science, business, and in our daily lives. But what is knowledge exactly, and can our search for it be successful? This course focuses on contemporary work in epistemology, the study of the nature and extent of human knowledge. Is knowledge something that can be analyzed and defined? What sorts of things if any, can we come to know? And what methods can we use to come to know these things? We will read seminal and recent work on the following and other related topics: the problem of skepticism, the search for a characterization of knowledge, and contextualist theories of knowledge. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "EPISTEMOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22272/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "EPISTEMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-231-601", "path": "/courses/22272/sections/601", "id": "22272-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-231-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/22272/sections/601/reviews/5069-PAUL-FRANCO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5069-PAUL-FRANCO", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "FRANCO", "id": "5069-PAUL-FRANCO", "name": "PAUL FRANCO"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "22272-601-5069-PAUL-FRANCO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-231", "path": "/courses/22272", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22272/sections", "values": [{"name": "EPISTEMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-231-601", "path": "/courses/22272/sections/601", "id": "22272-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-231-601"]}]}, "id": 22272, "aliases": ["PHIL-231"]}
