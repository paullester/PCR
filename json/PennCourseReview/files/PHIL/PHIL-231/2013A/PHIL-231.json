{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2372"}, "description": "Two basic assumptions of academic research are that there are truths and we can know them. In this introduction to metaphysics and epistemology, we will ask hard questions about the nature of reality and knowledge. On the metaphysics side, we'll ask what makes objects and people the same objects and people over time, and we'll explore how people can have free will. Depending on class interest, we may also explore some topics of contemporary metaphysics research, including the nature of truth itself and the basis of necessity and possibility. On the epistemology side, we will consider skeptical arguments, which purport to show that we can never know what's true, and we'll ask what's required for a belief to be justified, even if it fails to be knowledge. We may also explore other issues in contemorary epistemology, possibly including the role of probability in belief and formal epistemology, social aspects of belief-formation, and feminist epistemology. No philosophy background is required for the course but having taken another philosophy course may prove helpful. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "EPISTEMOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30852/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.57", "rTAQuality": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "EPISTEMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHIL-231-001", "path": "/courses/30852/sections/001", "id": "30852-001", "aliases": ["PHIL-231-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/30852/sections/001/reviews/6575-DANIEL-J--SINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6575-DANIEL-J--SINGER", "first_name": "DANIEL J.", "last_name": "SINGER", "id": "6575-DANIEL-J--SINGER", "name": "DANIEL J.
