Since its beginnings, social psychology has investigated interpersonal judgment, uncovering many biases in the way people evaluate other people and themselves. More recently, cognitive psychologists have also started to develop theories of how people understand and judge other people. This class is at the crossroad of these two traditions, looking into cognitive models of how people judge other people, and how people use similar mechanisms to judge themselves. It is intended to offer the advanced student a quasi-graduate environment where they are exposed to the frontiers of research on the subject, while also providing them with a comprehensive overview of the topic.\r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cvery well paced,\u201d and they reported that it \u201creally expanded their knowledge.\u201d The material itself was described as \u201cextremely interesting,\u201d and the lectures were described as \u201cenjoyable;\u201d however, students\u2019 class presentations were \u201csometimes quite boring and easy to lose focus on.\u201d Several students regretted that the class did not incorporate discussion and was confined mostly to lecturing.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mercier was described as \u201cexcellent,\u201d and students appreciated that he put a lot of effort into preparing each lecture. Students also commended his \u201cgreat ability\u201d to clarify difficult concepts and \u201cconvey complex information in a very clear manner.\u201d One complaint students had was that they did not receive feedback about work and grades throughout the semester, which made it difficult to know how they should improve their work in their final paper.\r\n\r\nThis course is an integrative senior seminar for the PPE major, only open to others by departmental permission. It is the highest-level class offered for PPE majors. Students reported that there was \u201cgenerally too much reading assigned each week,\u201d which resulted in many students failing to complete the readings. Many papers were required for this course, including a final paper worth the majority of each student\u2019s grade. Many students commented about the lack of feedback they received throughout the semester in terms of grades and quality of work and expressed concern about not knowing what to expect for their final grades. Some students also noted that they felt that there was not enough explanation about the requirements or expectations for their projects and paper.\r\n\r\n", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/23655/sections/304/reviews/4531-HUGO-MERCIER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4531-HUGO-MERCIER", "first_name": "HUGO", "last_name": "MERCIER", "id": "4531-HUGO-MERCIER", "name": "HUGO MERCIER"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "23655-304-4531-HUGO-MERCIER"}]
