{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4102"}, "description": "In this course we will ask how language works. How do speakers use sounds and shapes to make claims, promises, and threats? How do words and sentences connect to the world? In particular, what makes a word refer to an object or property, and what determines when a sentence is true or false? And how do speakers exploit conventional linguistic meaning for alternative ends, as in metaphor and sarcasm? We will approach these questions by reading classic texts by Frege, Russell, Austin, Grice, Searle, Kripke, Quine, Davidson, and others; but we will also apply these readings to actual, everyday linguistic contexts. Some comfort with basic first-order predicate logic will be required, but no previous experience with formal logic is assumed: I will explain all the relevant symbolism in class. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "PHIL OF LANGUAGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15001/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.81"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL OF LANGUAGE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-405-301", "path": "/courses/15001/sections/301", "id": "15001-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-405-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/15001/sections/301/reviews/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "first_name": "ELISABETH MAURA", "last_name": "CAMP", "id": "3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP", "name": "ELISABETH MAURA CAMP"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "15001-301-3459-ELISABETH-MAURA-CAMP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-405", "path": "/courses/15001", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15001/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL OF LANGUAGE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-405-301", "path": "/courses/15001/sections/301", "id": "15001-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-405-301"]}]}, "id": 15001, "aliases": ["PHIL-405"]}
