{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1438"}, "description": "The course starts with a discussion of theories of visual perception and their relation to philosophy. We survey the history of visual theories from Euclide to Marr and Rock, with stops to include Ibn al-Haytham, Descartes, Berkely, Helm holtz, and Koffka. We then consider selected philosophical topics, such as the existence and structure of visual space, the metaphysics of color qualities, the nature of object perception, or the representational relation between images and things imaged (e.g., between pictures and what they represent). \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "PHIL & VISUAL PERCEPTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24963/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.06", "rStimulateInterest": "1.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69", "rCommAbility": "0.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "PHIL & VISUAL PERCEPTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-423-401", "path": "/courses/24963/sections/401", "id": "24963-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-423-401", "VLST-223-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/24963/sections/401/reviews/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "first_name": "GARY", "last_name": "HATFIELD", "id": "1671-GARY-HATFIELD", "name": "GARY HATFIELD"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "24963-401-1671-GARY-HATFIELD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-423", "path": "/courses/24963", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24963/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHIL & VISUAL PERCEPTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-423-401", "path": "/courses/24963/sections/401", "id": "24963-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-423-401", "VLST-223-401"]}]}, "id": 24963, "aliases": ["PHIL-423", "VLST-223"]}
