{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4646"}, "description": "In this course we will investigate some of the ethical issues that arise from our relationship with the environment. We will examine important issues in environmental ethics, supplementing our discussions by considering how the latest scientific results affect environmental thinking and policy. Topics covered will include (but not be limited to): What are our responsibilities toward the environment, as individuals and as members of institutions? How do our responsibilities toward the environment relate to other ethical considerations? Do non-human animals/species/ecosystems have intrinsic value? What should conservationists conserve (Conservation vs restoration, keystone species vs ecosystems)? \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17898/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "1.79", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "2.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "2.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "2.36", "rInstructorQuality": "2.65"}, "section": {"name": "ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHIL-079-601", "path": "/courses/17898/sections/601", "id": "17898-601", "aliases": ["PHIL-079-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/17898/sections/601/reviews/3868-ANNA-M--CREMALDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3868-ANNA-M--CREMALDI", "first_name": "ANNA M.", "last_name": "CREMALDI", "id": "3868-ANNA-M--CREMALDI", "name": "ANNA M.
