{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2377"}, "description": "This class is a survey of 20th and 21st century metaethics--the metaphysics, epistemology, and psychology of morality. Beginning with G.E. Moore and working our way to the present day, we will read and discuss influential articles and book chapters addressing questions about the reality of values, our knowledge of them, and their motivational influence. All participants will be responsible for leading class discussion. All registered participants will also write several short response papers and either two 10-age papers or one 20-page paper. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SURVEY OF ETHICAL THEORY: METAETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27995/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "3.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "SURVEY OF ETHICAL THEORY: METAETHICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHIL-472-301", "path": "/courses/27995/sections/301", "id": "27995-301", "aliases": ["PHIL-472-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/27995/sections/301/reviews/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "first_name": "ADRIENNE M.", "last_name": "MARTIN", "id": "3458-ADRIENNE-M--MARTIN", "name": "ADRIENNE M.
