They were\r\nunhappy that he did not teach modern methods and instead referred to archaic and\r\nobsolete studies and programs. According to one student, \u201che was un-receptive to\r\nquestions and would tell students that their questions were dumb or pointless. In\r\naddition, recitations were not used as a time for students to ask questions but rather as\r\nadditional class time where mandatory new information was introduced.\u201d Most thought\r\nthat they did not fulfill the goal of the course and \u201ccould not honestly say I know\r\nanything about designing a process.\u201d\r\nMany of the students in this course were Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\r\nupperclassmen.
