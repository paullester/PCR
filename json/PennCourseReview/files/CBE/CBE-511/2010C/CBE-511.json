{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5084"}, "description": "This course deals with static and dynamic properties of two important classes of soft materials: polymers and amphiphiles. Examples of these materials include DNA, proteins, diblock copolymers, surfactants and phospholipids. The fundamental theories of these materials are critical of understanding ploymer processing, nanotechnology, biomembranes and biophysics. Special emphasis will be placedon understanding the chain conformation of polymer chains, thermodynamics of polymer chains, thermodynamics of polymer solutions and melts, dynamics of polymer and statistical thermodynamic principles of self-assembly. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PHYS CHEM-POLYM&AMPHIP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22756/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "PHYS CHEM-POLYM&AMPHIP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-511-001", "path": "/courses/22756/sections/001", "id": "22756-001", "aliases": ["CBE-511-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/22756/sections/001/reviews/4269-DAEYEON-LEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4269-DAEYEON-LEE", "first_name": "DAEYEON", "last_name": "LEE", "id": "4269-DAEYEON-LEE", "name": "DAEYEON LEE"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "22756-001-4269-DAEYEON-LEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CBE-511", "path": "/courses/22756", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22756/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYS CHEM-POLYM&AMPHIP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-511-001", "path": "/courses/22756/sections/001", "id": "22756-001", "aliases": ["CBE-511-001"]}]}, "id": 22756, "aliases": ["CBE-511"]}
