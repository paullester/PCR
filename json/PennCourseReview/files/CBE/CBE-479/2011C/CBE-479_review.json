On the other\r\nhand, non-seniors thought that the class was \u201ca good introduction to biochemistry that\r\ndidn't require previous experience in biology.\u201d\r\nThe students did not comment much on Professor Wattenbarger and instead\r\ncomplained mostly about the course structure and its lack of depth. However, one student\r\nsaid that the \u201cprofessor is very nice, but seems to not have a mastery of the material at\r\ntimes.\u201d\r\nOverall, students were upperclassmen. However, they recommended that it is\r\nmost suitable for non-seniors.
