{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4901"}, "description": "Fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and batteries are all electrochemical devices for the interconversion between chemical and electrical energy. These devices have inherently high efficiencies and are playing increasingly important roles in both large and small scale electrical power generation, transportation (e.g. hybrid and electric vehicles), and energy storage (e.g. production of H2 via electrolysis). This course will cover the basic electrochemistry and materials science that is needed in order to understand the operation of these devices, their principles of operation, and how they are used in modern applications. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ELEC ENERGY CONV&STORAGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21386/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "ELEC ENERGY CONV&STORAGE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-545-001", "path": "/courses/21386/sections/001", "id": "21386-001", "aliases": ["CBE-545-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/21386/sections/001/reviews/1304-JOHN-M--VOHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1304-JOHN-M--VOHS", "first_name": "JOHN M.", "last_name": "VOHS", "id": "1304-JOHN-M--VOHS", "name": "JOHN M.
