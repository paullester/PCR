Students generally found the exams to be fair.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 4 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/22751/sections/001/reviews/1304-JOHN-M--VOHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1304-JOHN-M--VOHS", "first_name": "JOHN M.", "last_name": "VOHS", "id": "1304-JOHN-M--VOHS", "name": "JOHN M.
