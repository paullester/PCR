{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/778"}, "description": "This course focuses on synthesis, characterization, microstructure, rheology, and structure-property relationships of polymers, polymer directed composites and their applications in biotechnology. Topical coverage includes: polymer synthesis and functionalization; polymerization kinetics; structure of glassy, crystalline, and rubbery polymers; thermodynamics of polymer solutions and blends, and crystallization; liquid crystallinity, microphase separation in block copolymers; polymer directed self-assembly of inorganic materials; biological applications of polymeric materials. Case studies include thermodynamics of block copolymer thin films and their applications in nanolithography, molecular templating of sol-gel growth using block copolymers as templates; structure-property of conducting and optically active polymers; polymer degradation in drug delivery; cell adhesion on polymer surface in tissue engineering. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "POLYMERS & BIOMATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27820/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.79", "rStimulateInterest": "2.26", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "2.52", "rWorkRequired": "2.68", "rInstructorAccess": "2.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "2.53", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "POLYMERS & BIOMATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-430-401", "path": "/courses/27820/sections/401", "id": "27820-401", "aliases": ["MSE-430-401", "CBE-510-401", "MSE-580-401", "CBE-430-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/27820/sections/401/reviews/2578-SHU-YANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2578-SHU-YANG", "first_name": "SHU", "last_name": "YANG", "id": "2578-SHU-YANG", "name": "SHU YANG"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "27820-401-2578-SHU-YANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-430", "path": "/courses/27820", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27820/sections", "values": [{"name": "POLYMERS & BIOMATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-430-401", "path": "/courses/27820/sections/401", "id": "27820-401", "aliases": ["MSE-430-401", "CBE-510-401", "MSE-580-401", "CBE-430-401"]}]}, "id": 27820, "aliases": ["MSE-430", "CBE-510", "MSE-580", "CBE-430"]}
