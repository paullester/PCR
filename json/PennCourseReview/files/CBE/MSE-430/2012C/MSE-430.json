{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/778"}, "description": "Polymer is one of the most widely used materials in our daily life, from the rubber tires to clothes, from photoresists in chip manufacturing to flexible electronics and smart sensors, from Scotch tapes to artificial tissues. This course teaches entry-level knowledge in polymer synthesis, characterization, thermodynamics, and structure-property relationship. Emphasis will be on understanding both chemical and physical aspects and polymer chain size/dimension that drive the molecular, microscopic and macroscopic structures and the resulting properties. We will discuss how to apply polymer designs to advance nanotechnology, electronics, energy and biotechnology. Case studies include thermodynamics of block copolymer thin films and their applications in nanolithography, shape memory polymers, hydrogels, and elastomeric deformation and applications. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "POLYMERS & BIOMATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29334/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rTAQuality": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.81", "rWorkRequired": "2.58", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.58", "rCommAbility": "2.58", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "POLYMERS & BIOMATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-430-401", "path": "/courses/29334/sections/401", "id": "29334-401", "aliases": ["MSE-430-401", "MSE-580-401", "CBE-510-401", "CBE-430-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/29334/sections/401/reviews/2578-SHU-YANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2578-SHU-YANG", "first_name": "SHU", "last_name": "YANG", "id": "2578-SHU-YANG", "name": "SHU YANG"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "29334-401-2578-SHU-YANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-430", "path": "/courses/29334", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29334/sections", "values": [{"name": "POLYMERS & BIOMATERIALS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-430-401", "path": "/courses/29334/sections/401", "id": "29334-401", "aliases": ["MSE-430-401", "MSE-580-401", "CBE-510-401", "CBE-430-401"]}]}, "id": 29334, "aliases": ["MSE-430", "MSE-580", "CBE-510", "CBE-430"]}
