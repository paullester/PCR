{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/778"}, "description": "This course focuses on synthesis, characterization, microstructure, rheology, and structure-property relationships of polymers, polymer directed composites and their applications in biotechnology. Topical coverage includes: polymer synthesis and functionalization; polymerization kinetics; structure of glassy, crystalline, and rubbery polymers; thermodynamics of polymer solutions and blends, and crystallization; liquid crystallinity, microphase separation in block copolymers; polymer directed self-assembly of inorganic materials; biological applications of polymeric materials. Case studies include thermodynamics of block copolymer thin films and their applications in nanolithography, molecular templating of sol-gel growth using block copolymers as templates; structure-property of conducting and optically active polymers; polymer degradation in drug delivery; cell adhesion on polymer surface in tissue engineering. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "INTRO TO POLYMERS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/778/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.22", "rStimulateInterest": "2.96", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39", "rReadingsValue": "2.87", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.39", "rCommAbility": "3.26", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO POLYMERS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-430-401", "path": "/courses/778/sections/401", "id": "778-401", "aliases": ["MSE-430-401", "MSE-580-401", "CHE-510-401", "CHE-430-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/778/sections/401/reviews/842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "first_name": "KAREN I.", "last_name": "WINEY", "id": "842-KAREN-I--WINEY", "name": "KAREN I.
