{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/778"}, "description": "This course focuses on synthesis, characterization, microstructure, rheology, and structure-property relationships of polymers, polymer directed composites and their applications in biotechnology. Topical coverage includes: polymer synthesis and functionalization; polymerization kinetics; structure of glassy, crystalline, and rubbery polymers; thermodynamics of polymer solutions and blends, and crystallization; liquid crystallinity, microphase separation in block copolymers; polymer directed self-assembly of inorganic materials; biological applications of polymeric materials. Case studies include thermodynamics of block copolymer thin films and their applications in nanolithography, molecular templating of sol-gel growth using block copolymers as templates; structure-property of conducting and optically active polymers; polymer degradation in drug delivery; cell adhesion on polymer surface in tissue engineering. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "INTRO TO POLYMERS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6857/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-430", "path": "/courses/6857", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6857/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO POLYMERS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-430-401", "path": "/courses/6857/sections/401", "id": "6857-401", "aliases": ["MSE-430-401", "MSE-580-401", "CBE-510-401", "CBE-430-401"]}]}, "id": 6857, "aliases": ["MSE-430", "MSE-580", "CBE-510", "CBE-430"]}
