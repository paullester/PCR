One student noted that \u201cthe first half of the course was excellent, but the second half seemed to jump from topic to topic a little too quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Holleran received many positive comments. Many of the students who took this course had Professor Holleran for other CBE courses and said that he \u201cseems to keep getting better.\u201d He was praised as an \u201cexcellent professor\u201d who taught students how to think about and use the material, making it \u201cintuitive through in class examples, derivations and explanation.\u201d Another student complimented his \u201clogical teaching style that works well with the minds of engineers,\u201d as well as his ability to make coming to class worthwhile.\r\n\r\nSome students found the exams to be too long, but the fair grading policy was universally praised. This course is a requirement for CBE majors and is typically taken by juniors. CBE 231 is a prerequisite.\r\n", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/22750/sections/001/reviews/3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN", "first_name": "SEAN", "last_name": "HOLLERAN", "id": "3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN", "name": "SEAN HOLLERAN"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "22750-001-3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CBE-350", "path": "/courses/22750", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22750/sections", "values": [{"name": "FLUID MECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-350-001", "path": "/courses/22750/sections/001", "id": "22750-001", "aliases": ["CBE-350-001"]}]}, "id": 22750, "aliases": ["CBE-350"]}
