It was well-structured featuring\r\napplications in the real world and problem solving skills. Students reported that they\r\nlearned a lot on fluid dynamics. However, one student indicated that he was still not sure\r\nhow the concepts taught in the course applied to various examples.\r\nStudents generally considered Dr. Holleran as a great lecturer. One student\r\ncomplimented his ability to \u201cget across the essentials\u201d and to help students figure out the\r\nthings that they need in the field. Another student praised his willingness to help\r\nstudents.\r\nThis course is a requirement for CBE majors and is typically taken by juniors, but\r\nit is recommended to anyone who is interested in chemical engineering.", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/24094/sections/001/reviews/3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN", "first_name": "SEAN", "last_name": "HOLLERAN", "id": "3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN", "name": "SEAN HOLLERAN"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "24094-001-3908-SEAN-HOLLERAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CBE-350", "path": "/courses/24094", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24094/sections", "values": [{"name": "FLUID MECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-350-001", "path": "/courses/24094/sections/001", "id": "24094-001", "aliases": ["CBE-350-001"]}]}, "id": 24094, "aliases": ["CBE-350"]}
