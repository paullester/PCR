Prerequisites for this course include CBE 230 (mass and energy balances in chemical reactions) and 231 (thermodynamics of fluids).\r\n\r\nStudents gave mixed reviews of the class material; some commented that the information was \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cimportant for CBE majors,\u201d while others complained that the material and the textbook were mostly \u201coutdated.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents judged Professor Lee to be highly interested and accessible, and generally \u201cdecent,\u201d especially considering his short time teaching. However, the lectures failed to interest most students, and some decided to read the textbook instead of attending class.\r\n\r\nThis course is required for CBE majors, and is typically taken as a junior. Some students found the problem solving style difficult to learn, and many felt the class could be improved if more problem examples were given in preparation for exams. Otherwise, students were not especially challenged by the material.", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/15441/sections/001/reviews/4269-DAEYEON-LEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4269-DAEYEON-LEE", "first_name": "DAEYEON", "last_name": "LEE", "id": "4269-DAEYEON-LEE", "name": "DAEYEON LEE"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "15441-001-4269-DAEYEON-LEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CBE-371", "path": "/courses/15441", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15441/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEPARATION PROCESSES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-371-001", "path": "/courses/15441/sections/001", "id": "15441-001", "aliases": ["CBE-371-001"]}]}, "id": 15441, "aliases": ["CBE-371"]}
