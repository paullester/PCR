While some complained that it was \u201cdifficult and boring,\" others said they \u201cthoroughly enjoyed\u201d it. According to one student, \u201cA student's ability to perform the analysis taught was regarded with appropriate value, as opposed to placing sole emphasis on simply generating a [correct] numeric value.\u201d The students appreciated the use of ASPEN (computer program) in their homework (it was \u201ca great way to practically apply the theoretical knowledge [taught in class]\u201d), and they also reported to have enjoyed the guest lectures. Some students felt that the content of the course needs adjusting. One student said it would have been better to have spent \u201cmore time on membrane separation rather than crystallization,\" while another said \u201ctoo much time is spent on distillation, rederiving similar equations over and over.\" They felt it would be preferable to \u201cgo faster through the material and cover more processes,\" because \u201cso little content is covered, exams must be made very long to produce a curve.\" Students also complained about the textbook which presented the material in a \u201ccompletely random and illogical way that is very difficult to follow when trying to study.\" They said that the homework assignments were too long (but enough time was given), and called for weighting the homework problems in a fairer manner. Some students complained that the exams were too long, but others thought they were \u201cwell-designed,\" \u201cchallenging\u201d, and \u201cassessed fairly.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Lee, in one word, was \u201cexcellent.\" His lectures were \u201cvery organized;\" his teaching style and course structure was \u201cconducive to both student learning and student success;\" he \u201c[connected] with [the] students,\" showed them \u201ca high level of respect;\" and he was \u201cknowledgeable and able to convey the material in an efficient manner.\" Students also described him to be \u201caccessible and approachable,\" \u201chelpful and enthusiastic.\" Many claimed he was their favorite CBE teacher. The only complained voiced was that his lectures were \u201cvery fast paced.\"\r\n\r\nThis course is a general requirement for CBE majors, and the students wouldn\u2019t recommend it to non-majors.\r\n\r\nThis review was based on 12 comments.
