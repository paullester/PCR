It focuses on mass and energy balances, properties of pure fluids, equations of state. It also looks at heat effects accompanying phase changes and chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nMany students indicated that the course material was interesting and relevant. One student reported that Dr. Shieh \u201calways included real-world applications of the concepts in his lectures,\u201d which was \u201cclearly lacking in all previous freshmen engineering classes\u201d.\r\n\r\nStudents generally commended Dr. Shieh for being a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic instructor who \u201coften went out of his way\u201d to help. One student described him as \u201cone of the better chemical engineering professors.\u201d According to another, he was excellent at \u201cexplaining concepts and methods to approach different problems,\u201d and he did not hesitate to solve hard examples in class.\r\n\r\nMany students described homework for the class as difficult but fair due to Dr. Shieh\u2019s excellent teaching. Students generally agreed that the exams were of \u201creasonable difficulty and length.\u201d It was suggested that students read the summary at the end of Chapter 7 in the textbook in preparation for the exams. This course is a requirement for the CBE curriculum, and the prerequisites are CBE 160 and sophomore standing.\r\n\r\nThis course review is based on the 8 student comments that were submitted.\r\n\r\n", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/22749/sections/001/reviews/1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "first_name": "WEN K", "last_name": "SHIEH", "id": "1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "name": "WEN K SHIEH"}, "num_reviewers": 45, "id": "22749-001-1168-WEN-K-SHIEH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CBE-230", "path": "/courses/22749", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22749/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATERIAL&ENERGY BALANCES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CBE-230-001", "path": "/courses/22749/sections/001", "id": "22749-001", "aliases": ["CBE-230-001"]}]}, "id": 22749, "aliases": ["CBE-230"]}
