Emphasis is placed on mass and energy balances, properties of pure fluids,\r\nand equations of state. It also focuses on heat effects accompanying phase changes and\r\nchemical reactions.\r\nMany students indicated that the course helped them develop necessary skills and\r\nknowledge to be a chemical engineer. Students agreed that the course was difficult and\r\nthe problem sets for this course were unevenly lengthy, but they found them helpful in\r\nunderstanding the course material and rewarding in preparing for the exams. However,\r\none student thought this course did \u201cnot contain that much information and could\r\npossibly be changed to include more topics.\u201d\r\nStudents described Professor Shieh as \u201cflexible and reasonable about adjusting the\r\ndue dates as necessary.\u201d One student reported that he \u201cespecially enjoyed all the real\r\nworld application Professor Shieh would discuss\u201d in lectures. Yet, another student\r\nthought that Dr. Shieh \u201cdid a poor job estimating how difficult the exams would be.\u201d\r\nStudents deemed the exams as relatively difficult but fair, since each exam is 2\r\nhours long and open-note/open-book. These exams were \u201ca fair reflection of what was\r\ntaught in class\u201d and were \u201cgraded exceptionally fairly.\u201d", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/24093/sections/001/reviews/1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "first_name": "WEN K", "last_name": "SHIEH", "id": "1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "name": "WEN K SHIEH"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "24093-001-1168-WEN-K-SHIEH"}]
