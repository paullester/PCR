The course focuses on the conceptual understanding of properties of pure fluids, equations of state, and heat effects accompanying phase changes and chemical reactions. Problem-solving skills needed to solve a wide range of realistic, process-related problems are also covered.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course material to be \u201creally useful,\u201d although one remarked that the \u201cnut-and-bolts\u201d nature of the material made the course \u201cmonotonous at times.\u201d Students felt that the material was entirely necessary for the major.\r\n\r\nStudents regarded Professor Shieh as an excellent teacher, who shows passion and dedication for what he\u2019s teaching. His recitations were found to be \u201cincredibly helpful,\u201d and his explanations and teaching styles made the material \u201cboth interesting and easy to understand.\u201d Students also found Professor Shieh to be accessible and helpful for questions. \r\n\r\nStudents felt prepared for the examinations and were pleased with the medium workload required for the course, although individual learning is sometimes required. Students appreciated the exams as well, one remarking that they \u201cforce you to fully demonstrate confidence without placing undue emphasis on time or tricks.\u201d There was disdain for the Koretsky textbook (\u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d). This course is required for CBE sophomores.\r\n", "num_students": 55, "path": "/courses/17058/sections/001/reviews/1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "first_name": "WEN K", "last_name": "SHIEH", "id": "1168-WEN-K-SHIEH", "name": "WEN K SHIEH"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "17058-001-1168-WEN-K-SHIEH"}]
