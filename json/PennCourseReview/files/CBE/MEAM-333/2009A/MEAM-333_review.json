The course emphasizes a physical and analytical understanding of conductive, convective, radiative heat transfer, the design of heat exchangers, and heat transfer with phase change. Topics covered include types of heat transfer processes, steady state and transient conduction solutions, emission and absorption of radiation, and heat transfer by forced and natural convection.\r\n\r\nStudents described the material covered in the class as \u201cinteresting\u201d and applicable to future careers.\r\n\r\nStudents thought Professor Lukes possessed \u201cextensive knowledge\u201d of the subject and made good efforts to ensure understanding of class material. However, many also reported that Professor Lukes relied heavily on powerpoint slides, making her lectures less helpful than recitations.\r\n\r\nSome students felt the material in the class was \u201crushed,\u201d contributing further to a heavy workload. Many deemed the amount of work to be \u201cway too much\u201d relative to the amount learned, and complained that the exams were \u201cridiculously hard.\u201d", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/16058/sections/001/reviews/1891-JENNIFER-R--LUKES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1891-JENNIFER-R--LUKES", "first_name": "JENNIFER R.", "last_name": "LUKES", "id": "1891-JENNIFER-R--LUKES", "name": "JENNIFER R.
