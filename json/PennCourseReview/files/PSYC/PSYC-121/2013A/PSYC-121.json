{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2097"}, "description": "This course presents an analysis of the cognitive processes involved in learning and memory, primarily in humans. We will survey the major findings concerning learning and memory discovered using laboratory experiments and the major theories of learning and memory derived from those findings. A major emphasis will be on the interplay between theory and data. Class assignments will require the statistical analysis of data obtained from experimental studies, but no specific prior background is required. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "LEARNING AND MEMORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30926/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.98", "rTAQuality": "1.98", "rStimulateInterest": "1.94", "rCourseQuality": "1.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.01", "rCommAbility": "1.97", "rInstructorAccess": "2.19"}, "section": {"name": "LEARNING AND MEMORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSYC-121-001", "path": "/courses/30926/sections/001", "id": "30926-001", "aliases": ["PSYC-121-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 87, "path": "/courses/30926/sections/001/reviews/3165-MICHAEL-J--KAHANA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3165-MICHAEL-J--KAHANA", "first_name": "MICHAEL J.", "last_name": "KAHANA", "id": "3165-MICHAEL-J--KAHANA", "name": "MICHAEL J.
