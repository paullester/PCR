Additionally, it examines the acquisition, maintenance, and elimination of behavior, and the effects of previous experience on responses to new situations.\r\n\r\nOverall, students enjoyed the class, noting that they \u201clearned a lot.\u201d They described the lectures as \u201cinteresting and to the point\u201d and felt that the \u201corganization of the course was impeccable.\u201d Another point that students appreciated was that the material was \u201cimportant in everyday psychology\u201d as it gave real insight into how research experiments are created. The course was therefore \u201cvery applicable and useful.\u201d However, students overwhelmingly reported the difficulty of the course, though many qualified their statements by saying they did not regret taking it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rescorla was described as \u201ca legend.\u201d Students were impressed by his deep and thorough knowledge of the material. Some found that because of his depth of knowledge his lectures were at times \u201cdifficult to follow,\u201d though many also praised his ability to clearly explain the information. Students found him to be a very demanding professor who did not hold back from criticizing both students and other branches of psychology. While he did not hold office hours, he did have lunch once a week with students in order to answer general questions.\r\n\r\nOne student found that \u201cwhile the amount of material is not overwhelming, experiment design, one of the focuses of this course, is not easy.\u201d However, most students agreed that the material was extremely difficult and that it required \u201cextensive reading and outside of class work.\u201d Some students were unclear about what would be on the exams and many students found that the grading standards were extremely high. Students recommended this course for majors or students who want to go into research. The only prerequisite for this course is PSYC 001.\r\n", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/23697/sections/001/reviews/1039-ROBERT-A-RESCORLA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1039-ROBERT-A-RESCORLA", "first_name": "ROBERT A", "last_name": "RESCORLA", "id": "1039-ROBERT-A-RESCORLA", "name": "ROBERT A RESCORLA"}, "num_reviewers": 61, "id": "23697-001-1039-ROBERT-A-RESCORLA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-121", "path": "/courses/23697", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23697/sections", "values": [{"name": "LEARNING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSYC-121-001", "path": "/courses/23697/sections/001", "id": "23697-001", "aliases": ["PSYC-121-001"]}]}, "id": 23697, "aliases": ["PSYC-121"]}
