{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1472"}, "description": "Brain imaging, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is a promising state-of-the-art tool used to study specialized human brain regions that are involved in cognitive functions. In the first half of the course, we will review the basics of the fMRI technique, current experimental design and analysis strategies, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of neuroimaging as a tool for cognitive neuroscientists. In the second half of the course, students will form into groups and propose a new experiment. As a team, you will program the experiment, acquire the fMRI data, and analyze your data. Each student will submit a paper describing the project and each group will give a presentation of their research. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "RES EXP COG NEUROSCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10932/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "3.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "RES EXP COG NEUROSCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-349-301", "path": "/courses/10932/sections/301", "id": "10932-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-349-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/10932/sections/301/reviews/1948-AMISHI-P-JHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1948-AMISHI-P-JHA", "first_name": "AMISHI P", "last_name": "JHA", "id": "1948-AMISHI-P-JHA", "name": "AMISHI P JHA"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "10932-301-1948-AMISHI-P-JHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-349", "path": "/courses/10932", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10932/sections", "values": [{"name": "RES EXP COG NEUROSCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-349-301", "path": "/courses/10932/sections/301", "id": "10932-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-349-301"]}]}, "id": 10932, "aliases": ["PSYC-349"]}
