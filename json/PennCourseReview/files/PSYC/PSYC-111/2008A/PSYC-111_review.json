Primary complaints about the course were that there was too much information covered, the class moved too quickly, and lectures were very reminiscent of the assigned textbook readings.  \r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Allred as \u201cvery nice and incredibly approachable.\u201d  While many agreed that the professor was a good communicator, most criticized the professor for reading directly from the slides and explaining little more than was covered in the text.  Students also commented that the professor moved too quickly through the more challenging material of the course.  \r\n\r\nThere was little commenting on the target audience or workload but one student described the tests as \u201cdifficult\u201d and Professor Allred as a harsh grader.
