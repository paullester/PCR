It will also explore the possibility that psychological science itself is not immune to the political debates swirling around it. Specific topics will include: the workings of belief systems (and their power to shape what we \"see\"), cognitive biases (and their power to cause miscalculations), sacred values and their role in stabilizing belief systems and social interaction, personality and ideology (the linkages between the personal and the political), and clashing conceptions of morality and distributive and corrective justice (striking variations among people in what they consider to be fair). \r\n\r\nThis course was described as \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cfantastic.\u201d Students expressed the informative nature of the course, and that it was \u201ccomplex.\u201d One student \u201cenjoyed the simulative nature of the discussion in class.\u201d Sometimes the homework could be \u201cambiguous and confusing.\u201d There are also \u201cpop\u201d debates in the class.\r\n\r\nDr. Tetlock is described as \u201cvery knowledgeable and intelligent individual\u201d and students \u201creally enjoyed the themes and overarching lessons that Professor Tetlock tried to instill within his students.\u201d He is also \u201cextremely dedicated and conscientious\u201d and described as \u201capproachable.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the course load, there were comments regarding \u201cuseless assignments,\u201d such as the pop debates and class surveys.
