{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5471"}, "description": "By forming mental representations of things not immediately present to the senses (imagination), and/or simulating possible futures (prospection), humans can generate novel ideas and products (creativity) that contribute to human progress and flourishing. This course will specifically focus on imagination and creativity within the field of psychology. Students will learn about the cognitive, motivational, and social processes that shaped important creative insights (or big moments) in the history of the discipline. In addition, students will be given the opportunity to apply knowledge gained from the course by designing their own original creative research proposal as the final project for the course. Note: This course constitutes a research study designed to investigate how scientific creativity can best be taught to undergraduate students. Student participation in the research study is voluntary, subject to informed consent, and will not affect their performance in the course. For more details,or to request admission, contact Olivia Riffle(riffleo@sas.upenn.edu), our Research Coordinator. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "SEMINAR POSITIVE PSYCH: Imagination and Creativity in Psychology:An Applied Course & Research Study", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30938/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.93", "rTAQuality": "3.46", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "SEMINAR POSITIVE PSYCH: Imagination and Creativity in Psychology:An Applied Course & Research Study", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-466-301", "path": "/courses/30938/sections/301", "id": "30938-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-466-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/30938/sections/301/reviews/1033-MARTIN-E--P--SELIGMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1033-MARTIN-E--P--SELIGMAN", "first_name": "MARTIN E.
