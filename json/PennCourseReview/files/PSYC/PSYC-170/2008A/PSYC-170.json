Topics include social influence, conformity and obedience, persuasion, aggression and conflict, altruism, stereotypes and prejudice, interpersonal attraction, and the self-concept.\r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed this course and found the subject matter to be very interesting. One student commented that this is a \u201cgreat course that is useful in everyday life!\u201d Others praised the interesting, real-life examples that were included in lectures.  \r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Siev to be very engaging and were impressed with how much discussion there was considering the size of the class. One student noted that \u201cProfessor Siev was a really great professor. He was very illustrative of the material and you could tell that he really cared about the students and whether we understood what was going on or not.\u201d However there were some who commented that Professor Siev\u2019s lectures were a bit too repetitive of the textbook material. \r\n\r\nThe course fulfills the Society Sector requirement and the only prerequisite for the course is Psyc 001, Introduction to Experimental Psychology. Students recommended this class to psychology majors and non-majors and did not feel like there was much work required for the course.
