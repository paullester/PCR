{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2392"}, "description": "The major theories of personality, including those emphasizing unconscious process (especially Freud, Jung, and Adler) and those consistent with awareness (Allport, Murray, Kelly, Rogers, Maslow, Bandura, among others) are traced to their empirical origins; the current status of the theories is evaluated, and their basic assumptions about human nature are contrasted.
