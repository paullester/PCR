{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/961"}, "description": "What predicts professional and academic success? In this course, students will work together in groups of 2 to 4 on research projects directed at this question. In particular, we will test the importance of personality, motivation, interest, and ability to achievement in high school, in college, and in business. The course members meet 6 hours per week (formally and informally); an additional 4 hours of work per week will be completed outside of the lab. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "RESEARCH EXP THEORY PERS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13822/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "1.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "RESEARCH EXP THEORY PERS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-364-301", "path": "/courses/13822/sections/301", "id": "13822-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-364-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/13822/sections/301/reviews/1025-DAVID-R-WILLIAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1025-DAVID-R-WILLIAMS", "first_name": "DAVID R", "last_name": "WILLIAMS", "id": "1025-DAVID-R-WILLIAMS", "name": "DAVID R WILLIAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "13822-301-1025-DAVID-R-WILLIAMS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.63", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "RESEARCH EXP THEORY PERS: Predictors of Academic and Professional Success", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "PSYC-364-302", "path": "/courses/13822/sections/302", "id": "13822-302", "aliases": ["PSYC-364-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/13822/sections/302/reviews/3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH", "first_name": "ANGELA LEE", "last_name": "DUCKWORTH", "id": "3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH", "name": "ANGELA LEE DUCKWORTH"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "13822-302-3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-364", "path": "/courses/13822", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13822/sections", "values": [{"name": "RESEARCH EXP THEORY PERS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-364-301", "path": "/courses/13822/sections/301", "id": "13822-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-364-301"]}, {"name": "RESEARCH EXP THEORY PERS: Predictors of Academic and Professional Success", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "PSYC-364-302", "path": "/courses/13822/sections/302", "id": "13822-302", "aliases": ["PSYC-364-302"]}]}, "id": 13822, "aliases": ["PSYC-364"]}
