Its focus includes theories of ethics and their application to case studies in business. Topics include moral issues in advertising and sales; hiring and promotion; financial management; corporate pollution; product safety; and decision-making across borders and cultures.\r\n\r\n Many students thought that this course is \u201chighly recommended\u201d and that they \u201clearned a lot.\u201d The one problem many students noticed is that the notes are not provided in a \u201clegible manner,\u201d making it difficult to learn in class. Students overall found this course, however, to be lectures to be pretty \u201cstraightforward.\u201d \r\n\r\nMost students found that Professor Rosenbaum \u201cdoes a great job explaining complex concepts using examples\u201d and  \u201cdoes a very good job of engaging students and making the material more accessible.\u201d Many students liked that Professor Rosenbaum was \u201caccessible,\u201d \u201cwitty,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201cin complete command of the material in the classroom\u201d making him a \u201cbrilliant professor.\u201d However, some students thought that he demonstrated \u201cpoor board work\u201d and that is \u201cwriting on the chalk board is too small and sloppy\u201d while he \u201cdoes not organize the things he writes on the board throughout class.\u201d \r\n\r\nOverall, most students found that the subject matter of this course was \u201cdifficult to grasp\u201d and that there was a \u201cmismatch between lectures/tests and the assigned readings\u201d because the readings are much more difficult and involved. Many students found the bulk pack to be a \u201ctremendous help\u201d and the practice exams to be \u201chelpful in learning how to apply the methods\u201d while the \u201cbooks are not helpful with further explanations.\u201d Some students also did not like that there was \u201cnot a lot of feedback outside of the exams.\u201d This course\u2019s prerequisites are STAT 101 or 112 or equivalent.
