Several students described him as \u201cpersonable\u201d, \u201capproachable\u201d, \u201cengaging and entertaining.\u201d However, other students felt \u201cdiscouraged\u201d and that Professor Ali \u201cwas not willing to help (students) when (they were) struggling.\u201d They claimed that his teaching style was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and that he was \u201cnot as friendly as he seems.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students found the tests to be unfair, \u201cambiguous,\u201d and \u201cnit-picking,\u201d focusing on memorization of \u201calmost silly details\u201d as opposed to understanding of material. A few students commented that they would have enjoyed the course more were it not for the difficult multiple-choice exams. The material itself was not too difficult, but the tests were a major source of complaint.
