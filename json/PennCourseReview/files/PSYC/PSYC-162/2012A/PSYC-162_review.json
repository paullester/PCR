PSYC 001 is a prerequisite for this course.\r\n\tMany students found the material \"interesting.\"  Most students liked the course textbook, but a great deal of students stated that they would have liked Professor Boyd to post the lecture PowerPoint slides online, as they were not posted.\r\n\tStudents appreciated Professor Boyd's \"helpfulness\" and \"flexible office hours.\"  However, many students thought Boyd often appeared \"unprepared\" for lecture.  Some students complained that Boyd often simply read off her PowerPoint slides.\r\n\tSome students complained that the exams tested on material not covered during the lectures.
