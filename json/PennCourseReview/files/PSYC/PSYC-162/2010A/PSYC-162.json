On the other hand, some felt the casebook readings were essential for understanding real world applications of the subject matter.\r\nMost students found Professor Krause to be a good lecturer and found that she had \u201centhusiasm for the subject matter,\u201d which \u201cmade lectures consistently engaging and significantly aided in understanding of the course content.\u201d Professor Krause brought in many guest lecturers and this approach received mixed reviews from his students.\r\nStudents noted that there was a lot of textbook reading and pointed out that the exams covered material from the reading that was not covered in lecture. The course was recommended to anyone with an interest in psychology, and especially for majors.
