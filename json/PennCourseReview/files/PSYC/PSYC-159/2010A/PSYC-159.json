Some claimed that \u201cthe lectures were very enjoyable\u201d and the class was \u201cvery difficult, yet very rewarding.\u201d Others were not as pleased, describing the material as \u201cdry\u201d and very hard to understand. A key factor in the students\u2019 reactions to the class seemed to be their comfort with the mathematical concepts involved, since it \u201cengages almost exclusively with statistical models of human memory.\u201d\r\nStudent opinions of Professor Kahana were similarly mixed. Some used words such as \u201chilarious,\u201d \u201cbright,\u201d and \u201cwell-spoken\u201d to describe the professor and others further portrayed him as \u201cextremely knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about the course.\u201d One student said he \u201cwas very open to speaking with students and had the goal of getting to know every student personally.\u201d A few described his style as \u201cboring\u201d and were unappreciative of him \u201cjumping from one tangent to another.\u201d\r\nThough the material seemed to have a heavy mathematical focus, some students recommend the course to \u201canyone who is interested in psychology or just looking for an interesting elective.\u201d Others felt the course would be irrelevant to most students unless they were \u201cplanning to study human memory or go into this field.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/26690/sections/001/reviews/3165-MICHAEL-J--KAHANA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3165-MICHAEL-J--KAHANA", "first_name": "MICHAEL J.", "last_name": "KAHANA", "id": "3165-MICHAEL-J--KAHANA", "name": "MICHAEL J.
