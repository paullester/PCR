{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5027"}, "description": "An introduction to the study of positive emotions, positive character traits, and positive institutions. The positive emotions consist of emotions about the past (e.g., serenity, satisfaction, pride), about the future (e.g., hope, optimism, faith), and emotions about the present (pleasure and gratification). The distinction among the pleasant life, the good life, and the meaningful life is drawn. The positive traits include wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and spirituality, and the classification of these virtues is explored. The positive institutions are exemplified by extended families, free press, humane leadership, and representative government. \n\n", "semester": "2011B", "name": "INTRO POSITIVE PSYCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25507/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO POSITIVE PSYCH", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "PSYC-266-920", "path": "/courses/25507/sections/920", "id": "25507-920", "aliases": ["PSYC-266-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/25507/sections/920/reviews/5962-ELI-TSUKAYAMA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5962-ELI-TSUKAYAMA", "first_name": "ELI", "last_name": "TSUKAYAMA", "id": "5962-ELI-TSUKAYAMA", "name": "ELI TSUKAYAMA"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "25507-920-5962-ELI-TSUKAYAMA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-266", "path": "/courses/25507", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25507/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO POSITIVE PSYCH", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "PSYC-266-920", "path": "/courses/25507/sections/920", "id": "25507-920", "aliases": ["PSYC-266-920"]}]}, "id": 25507, "aliases": ["PSYC-266"]}
