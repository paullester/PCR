{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2667"}, "description": "This course examines the interaction of vision with higher-prder cognitive processes. In plain terms: once the visual system has recovered a set of surfaces from the surrounding scene, what does the brain then do with that information to make it useful? Possible topics will include: object and face recognition, attention, awareness, mental imagery, spatial cognition, and action. Particular emphasis will be placed on cognitive neuroscientific work that addresses these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "VISUAL COGNITION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7066/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "VISUAL COGNITION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSYC-459-001", "path": "/courses/7066/sections/001", "id": "7066-001", "aliases": ["PSYC-459-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/7066/sections/001/reviews/2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN", "first_name": "RUSSELL ALAN", "last_name": "EPSTEIN", "id": "2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN", "name": "RUSSELL ALAN EPSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "7066-001-2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-459", "path": "/courses/7066", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7066/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISUAL COGNITION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSYC-459-001", "path": "/courses/7066/sections/001", "id": "7066-001", "aliases": ["PSYC-459-001"]}]}, "id": 7066, "aliases": ["PSYC-459"]}
