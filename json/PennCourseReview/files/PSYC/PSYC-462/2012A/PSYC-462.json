Although the topics discussed in the seminar vary each semester, the students stated that the material covered were \u201cinteresting and relevant.\u201d One student described it as a \u201cvery balanced, interesting, and high-level course.\u201d There were several topics on sleep, but another student mentioned that \u201cmore psychology readings may reinforce the main points of the class better.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll of the students who reviewed the class had positive comments for Dr. Minkel. They mentioned that he was \u201ca great lecturer\u201d and \u201ctreated us like adults.\u201d One student even stated that Dr. Minkel \u201cis hands down the best professor that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been at Penn.\u201d He is \u201cvery easy to talk to\u201d and \u201ca well spoken person who loves teaching.\u201d\r\n\t\r\nOne student suggested that \u201cif you're not interested in sleep or psychopathology, you might not find much of interest in this class, as it\u2019s very focused.\u201d Students should be aware that this is a three hour long seminar that meets once every week. Only undergraduates are permitted to enroll in this class. A prerequisite of PSYC 162 is required.
