This seminar will review existing treatments for such disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and several others) with a special emphasis on ways to integrate sleep treatments into more traditional approaches. Basic findings from sleep science and psychopathology will be discussed in order to better understand the principles that drive existing treatments and to propose new treatments that might work even better.\r\n\r\nStudents very much enjoyed this \u201cengaging and thought-provoking\u201d class that covered \u201cfascinating\u201d material. While students commented that the readings were hard, they believed they felt like they were actually learning and digesting the material, as opposed to just trying to pass a test and get a good grade. Students wished this class had been a little smaller to facilitate more open discussion, but overall they were greatly pleased by the course.\r\n\r\nThe students in this course unanimously praised Professor Minkel. They stated that \u201che was the reason this class was excellent\u201d and that he was the most \u201capproachable and genuinely interested professor at Penn.\u201d Furthermore, he was described as \u201ceffective, exceptional, and very passionate.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents would recommend this course to any student interested in psychology.\r\n\r\n*This review is based on 7 student comments. \r\n", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/25046/sections/601/reviews/3611-JARED-D-MINKEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3611-JARED-D-MINKEL", "first_name": "JARED D", "last_name": "MINKEL", "id": "3611-JARED-D-MINKEL", "name": "JARED D MINKEL"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "25046-601-3611-JARED-D-MINKEL"}]
