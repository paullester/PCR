The course will look at the theoretical underpinnings of the field, and sample some of the recent contributions to this growing area. It will cover areas ranging from reasoning to relationships to culture.\r\n\r\nStudents overwhelmingly liked the course, describing it as \u201cwonderful,\u201d \u201cstrongly recommended,\u201d and \u201cone of the best at Penn.\u201d The material was reportedly very interesting, but often difficult to grasp and theoretical in nature. Students praised how the material was unlike any other PSYC class and taught new ways of thinking.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, students loved Professor Kurzban, describing him as a truly excellent professor. In particular, they lauded his \u201centertaining\u201d lecture style that was spiced up by his \u201cgreat sense of humor.\u201d Students also were impressed with Kurzban\u2019s knowledge and willingness to meet with students for help. However, one student did complain that the professor wouldn\u2019t discuss the grading of essays on tests with the students.\r\n\r\nStudents seemed to regard the class as quite difficult, reporting that the multiple-choice exams were \u201ctricky.\u201d One student relates that \u201cthe exam questions were fairly difficult but the ability to drop one of the three midterms is appreciated.\u201d One student complained of a \u201cton of reading\u201d in the beginning of the semester, suggesting that it be cut down. This class is open to all students and has PSYC-001 as a prerequisite.
