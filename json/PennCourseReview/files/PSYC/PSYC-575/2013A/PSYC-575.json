{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5724"}, "description": "This course is aimed primarily at graduate students in Ph.D. programs in psychology, business, and the social sciences, and very highly motivated undergrads. Key questions to be examined include: What are taboos? What types of hypotheses are politically taboo in your zones of specialization in the behavioral and social sciences? Why do taboos arise and when do they change? What are the career consequences of violating topical taboos? And what are the epistemic opportunity costs to your field: true discoveries that would have been made but werent because of implicit or explicit proscriptions on what is/is not fundable or publishableand false discoveries that were made but would have been corrected because of the same proscriptions? How can these epistemic opportunity costs be gauged? Is it ever justifiable in your preferred philosophy of scienceto put moral-political boundaries on the thinkable? \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY: RESEARCH TABOOS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30940/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.67", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY: RESEARCH TABOOS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-575-301", "path": "/courses/30940/sections/301", "id": "30940-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-575-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/30940/sections/301/reviews/5521-PHILIP-E--TETLOCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5521-PHILIP-E--TETLOCK", "first_name": "PHILIP E.", "last_name": "TETLOCK", "id": "5521-PHILIP-E--TETLOCK", "name": "PHILIP E.
