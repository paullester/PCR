Students are required to have taken PYSC001 before they can enroll in this course.\r\nStudents seemed to be somewhat split on the course. Some appreciated the \u201cgeneral foundation of material\u201d provided, while others were less enthusiastic about the \u201cpainful\u201d guest lecturers and the amount of reading. Some complained about how students were unable to have their own copies of lecture slides, which were \u201ccopyrighted so that students could not have printed copies to refer to.\u201d Certain students complained about the article review assignments, which they felt were \u201cawful\u201d and unhelpful. Textbooks were criticized as \u201cscattered\u201d and unorganized.\r\nStudents criticized Professor Jackson for often teaching too fast, \u201craising the stress level\u201d of the class by talking faster than students could take notes. Other students praised her accessibility, referring to her as \u201cone of the most approachable.\u201d The main criticisms of Professor Jackson stemmed from the unavailability of the lecture slides and her speed.\r\nThe perquisite for PSYC 280 is PSYC 001. Students described the workload as \u201cperfect,\u201d while also mentioning that Professor Jackson seemed to be an easy grader. Students all seemed to enjoy the actual material of the course.
