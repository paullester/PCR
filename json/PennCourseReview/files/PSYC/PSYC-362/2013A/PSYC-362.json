No students will be admitted to Dr. Hunt's course in the spring. Dept permission required. Are you interested in expanding our understanding of anxiety and affective disorders? If you'd like to work hard for two semesters, and have a publishable paper at the end of the year, this may be the course for you. Offering more support and structure than an independent study, this course will still allow you to make an original contribution to one of several research areas, including phobias, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. By instructor permission only. Junior and Senior Psychology majors only. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "RESEARCH EXP ABNORMAL: PSYCHOPATHOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30932/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "RESEARCH EXP ABNORMAL: PSYCHOPATHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-362-301", "path": "/courses/30932/sections/301", "id": "30932-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-362-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/30932/sections/301/reviews/1040-MELISSA-HUNT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1040-MELISSA-HUNT", "first_name": "MELISSA", "last_name": "HUNT", "id": "1040-MELISSA-HUNT", "name": "MELISSA HUNT"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "30932-301-1040-MELISSA-HUNT"}, {"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.80", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.73", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "RESEARCH EXP ABNORMAL: Gender Differences in Adolescent Psychopathology", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "PSYC-362-302", "path": "/courses/30932/sections/302", "id": "30932-302", "aliases": ["PSYC-362-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/30932/sections/302/reviews/4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE", "first_name": "ELIZABETH D", "last_name": "KRAUSE", "id": "4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE", "name": "ELIZABETH D KRAUSE"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "30932-302-4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-362", "path": "/courses/30932", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30932/sections", "values": [{"name": "RESEARCH EXP ABNORMAL: PSYCHOPATHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-362-301", "path": "/courses/30932/sections/301", "id": "30932-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-362-301"]}, {"name": "RESEARCH EXP ABNORMAL: Gender Differences in Adolescent Psychopathology", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "PSYC-362-302", "path": "/courses/30932/sections/302", "id": "30932-302", "aliases": ["PSYC-362-302"]}]}, "id": 30932, "aliases": ["PSYC-362"]}
