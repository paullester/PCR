Many students pointed to the course's lack of structure.\r\n\tProfessor Dahan does not use PowerPoint for her lectures.  Many students thus found her lectures \"disorganized\" and \"difficult to follow.\" Students found Professor to be \u201cvery intelligent\u201d though most found it hard for Professor Dahan to explain difficult course concepts. \r\n\tMany students reported that test averages for this course were very high.  This course is required for psychology majors. PSYC 001 is a pre-requisite for this class.
