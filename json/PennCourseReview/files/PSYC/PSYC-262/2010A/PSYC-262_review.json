Students will be encouraged to explore how the current research may be applicable to their own lives. Topics will include positive interventions, happiness-increasing exercises, and other efforts of self-improvement in both clinical and non-distressed populations. Other more general topics of relevance to the study of happiness and well-being will be examined (e.g., theories of well-being, measurement of well-being, assessment of intervention research).\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the students that took this course were extremely fond of it, with most reporting that they \u201cenjoyed\u201d it and \u201clooked forward to coming to class every Wednesday.\u201d Students praised the course for its applicability to their own everyday lives and seemed to learn a great deal. The class featured stimulating discussions and \u201cfostered student engagement and friendships.\u201d\r\n\r\nEvery student submitting a comment had positive things to say about Professor Schueller, with one calling him \u201cby far the best instructor I have had at Penn.\u201d He was said to be \u201caccessible\u201d and \u201calways willing to help.\u201d Reportedly he was an enthusiastic instructor, with \u201cgenuine enthusiasm for the course material.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents seemed content with the workload and difficulty of the class, and had no complaints to register. One student praised the homework assignments for their relevance to actual life and happiness. The class content was reportedly valuable to everyone, regardless of whether one was a Psychology major or not.
