Whereas traditional psychology focuses on the individual as the subject of study and intervention, the community approach takes into consideration the interaction between the individual and the environment. Additionally, where traditional approaches to psychology typically deal with individuals\u2019 existing problems (i.e., the medical model), community psychology allows for proactive strategies of treatment, such as programs for prevention and awareness. This course gave an overview of the methodology, theory, and application of the community psychology perspective with a focus on its application to the mental health field.\r\n\r\nMost students did not comment on the quality of the course, although the few that did mentioned that the subject matter seemed more interesting than the class was actually able to convey. \u201cIt seems like for a lot of what we have learned is that there are no real answers consensus,\u201d one student mused. Several students mentioned that more \u201cfield trips\u201d and \u201chands on interaction\u201d with the material would make the class more exciting and the material more accessible.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jameson used a teaching method in which he asked students to send in questions about their assigned reading, and then used these questions to structure the information he discussed during class. However, students did completely buy into this unusual idea, some even going so far as to say that it was \u201cpretty disappointing.\u201d Others gave the method credit, saying it was \u201ca useful way to generate class discussions.\u201d One student did acknowledge that the discussions were \u201ca bit slow,\u201d \u201crepetitive,\u201d and too unstructured for really learning the material. \r\n\r\nThis course has a prerequisite PSCY162: Abnormal Psychology.", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/20759/sections/301/reviews/3740-JOHN-PAUL-JAMESON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3740-JOHN-PAUL-JAMESON", "first_name": "JOHN PAUL", "last_name": "JAMESON", "id": "3740-JOHN-PAUL-JAMESON", "name": "JOHN PAUL JAMESON"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "20759-301-3740-JOHN-PAUL-JAMESON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "S/T ABNORMAL PSYCH: PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "PSYC-262-302", "path": "/courses/20759/sections/302", "id": "20759-302", "aliases": ["PSYC-262-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/20759/sections/302/reviews/4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE", "first_name": "ELIZABETH D", "last_name": "KRAUSE", "id": "4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE", "name": "ELIZABETH D KRAUSE"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "20759-302-4089-ELIZABETH-D-KRAUSE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "S/T ABNORMAL PSYCH: SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY", "sectionnum": "303", "primary_alias": "PSYC-262-303", "path": "/courses/20759/sections/303", "id": "20759-303", "aliases": ["PSYC-262-303"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/20759/sections/303/reviews/2668-JACQUES-BARBER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2668-JACQUES-BARBER", "first_name": "JACQUES", "last_name": "BARBER", "id": "2668-JACQUES-BARBER", "name": "JACQUES BARBER"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "20759-303-2668-JACQUES-BARBER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-262", "path": "/courses/20759", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20759/sections", "values": [{"name": "S/T ABNORMAL PSYCH: COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSYC-262-301", "path": "/courses/20759/sections/301", "id": "20759-301", "aliases": ["PSYC-262-301"]}, {"name": "S/T ABNORMAL PSYCH: PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "PSYC-262-302", "path": "/courses/20759/sections/302", "id": "20759-302", "aliases": ["PSYC-262-302"]}, {"name": "S/T ABNORMAL PSYCH: SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY", "sectionnum": "303", "primary_alias": "PSYC-262-303", "path": "/courses/20759/sections/303", "id": "20759-303", "aliases": ["PSYC-262-303"]}]}, "id": 20759, "aliases": ["PSYC-262"]}
