{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1040"}, "description": "As a science, sociology uses various tools to establish knowledge about the social world, as one step in the process of producing explanatory (and ideally, predictive) theory. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to different sociological methods, including survey research and associated quantitative/statistical analysis, interviewing, ethnography, historical-comparative and archival research, experimentation and computer simulatin. We will review basic mechanics for applying these methods, and discuss the assumptions behind each and the kind of insight each yields. The class is required of sociology majors, and satisfies the College quantitative data analysis requirement. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "INTRO SOC RESEARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19314/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.44", "rDifficulty": "1.91", "rStimulateInterest": "2.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.03", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.79", "rCommAbility": "2.21", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO SOC RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-100-401", "path": "/courses/19314/sections/401", "id": "19314-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-100-401", "HSOC-100-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/19314/sections/401/reviews/2690-JAN-JAEGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2690-JAN-JAEGER", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "JAEGER", "id": "2690-JAN-JAEGER", "name": "JAN JAEGER"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "19314-401-2690-JAN-JAEGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-100", "path": "/courses/19314", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19314/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO SOC RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-100-401", "path": "/courses/19314/sections/401", "id": "19314-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-100-401", "HSOC-100-401"]}]}, "id": 19314, "aliases": ["SOCI-100", "HSOC-100"]}
