{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/623"}, "description": "This seminar asks the question: What is public health in the United States? It will examine this question from three vantage points, history, contemporary policy and community service. This mixture of teaching approaches is especially well suited to the complex multiparty negotiations that have characterized public health in the United States since the nineteenth century. The web of highly charged socioeconomic and political relationships that encases public health decision-making involves several professions, various levels of government and a shifting array of community groups and private citizens. By placing these relationships in both historical and contemporary context this course allows students a deeper understanding of the social interactions that are - and have been -- at the heart of American public health work. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "PUBLIC HEALTH IN AMER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/623/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.05", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "PUBLIC HEALTH IN AMER", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-317-401", "path": "/courses/623/sections/401", "id": "623-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-317-401", "HSSC-317-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/623/sections/401/reviews/661-JANET-TIGHE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/661-JANET-TIGHE", "first_name": "JANET", "last_name": "TIGHE", "id": "661-JANET-TIGHE", "name": "JANET TIGHE"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "623-401-661-JANET-TIGHE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-317", "path": "/courses/623", "sections": {"path": "/courses/623/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC HEALTH IN AMER", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-317-401", "path": "/courses/623/sections/401", "id": "623-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-317-401", "HSSC-317-401"]}]}, "id": 623, "aliases": ["HSOC-317", "HSSC-317"]}
