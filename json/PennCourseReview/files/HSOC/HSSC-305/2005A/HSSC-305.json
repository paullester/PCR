{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3661"}, "description": "Why do we have the present health care system? What values and conflicts does it represent? What does it tell us about ourselves? Why are there so many uninsured? Can Medicare survive? And why the current fashion for consumer-directed care? This seminar takes a historical, policy-oriented approach to address these questions and others. Assigned reading and a research paper are required. Divergent views welcomed. Ability to argue is a plus. Open to sophomores and above. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "AMERICAN HEALTH POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10578/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.91", "rCourseQuality": "3.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.91"}, "section": {"name": "AMERICAN HEALTH POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-305-401", "path": "/courses/10578/sections/401", "id": "10578-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-305-401", "HSOC-315-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/10578/sections/401/reviews/3661-ROSEMARY-A-STEVENS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3661-ROSEMARY-A-STEVENS", "first_name": "ROSEMARY A", "last_name": "STEVENS", "id": "3661-ROSEMARY-A-STEVENS", "name": "ROSEMARY A STEVENS"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "10578-401-3661-ROSEMARY-A-STEVENS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-305", "path": "/courses/10578", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10578/sections", "values": [{"name": "AMERICAN HEALTH POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-305-401", "path": "/courses/10578/sections/401", "id": "10578-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-305-401", "HSOC-315-401"]}]}, "id": 10578, "aliases": ["HSSC-305", "HSOC-315"]}
