{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4868"}, "description": "Environments and Health will explore how medical professionals, scientists and the general public have historically understood the environment to impact different people, in different places, in different ways. Taking an international perspective, we will interrogate medical theories that underpinned popular practices, like health tourism, public health campaigns and colonial medical programs. We will also consider how people constructed and understood a variety of environments -- from famrs to factories, cemeteries to cities -- to be healthy or not. Centered around a single research project, students will have the opportunity to explore a contemporary environmental health issue of their choice, contextualizing it within historical ideas about the interconnections between bodies and place. \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "ENVIRONMENTS & HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28370/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ENVIRONMENTS & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "HSOC-158-910", "path": "/courses/28370/sections/910", "id": "28370-910", "aliases": ["HSOC-158-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/28370/sections/910/reviews/6207-MEGHAN-L-CRNIC", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6207-MEGHAN-L-CRNIC", "first_name": "MEGHAN L", "last_name": "CRNIC", "id": "6207-MEGHAN-L-CRNIC", "name": "MEGHAN L CRNIC"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "28370-910-6207-MEGHAN-L-CRNIC"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-158", "path": "/courses/28370", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28370/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENVIRONMENTS & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "HSOC-158-910", "path": "/courses/28370/sections/910", "id": "28370-910", "aliases": ["HSOC-158-910"]}]}, "id": 28370, "aliases": ["HSOC-158"]}
