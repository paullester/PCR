{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4589"}, "description": "The CDC estimates that 1 in 150 children have autism. Three decades ago, this number was 1 in 5,000. The communities in which these children are identified in ever increasing numbers are ill prepared to meet their needs. Scientists have struggled to understand the causes of this disorder, its treatment, and why it appears to be rapidly increasing. Families, policy makers, schools and the healthcare system have argued bitterly in the press and in the courts about the best way to cre for these children and the best ways to pay for this care. In this class, we will use autism as a case study to understnad how psychiatric and developmental disorders of childhood come to be defined over time, their biologocal and environmental causes identified, and treatments developed. We will also discuss the identification and care of these children in the broader context of the American education and healthcare systems. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "AUTISM EPIDEMIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23246/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "2.35", "rStimulateInterest": "3.35", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.39", "rWorkRequired": "2.19", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.35", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "AUTISM EPIDEMIC", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-052-301", "path": "/courses/23246/sections/301", "id": "23246-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-052-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/23246/sections/301/reviews/2518-DAVID-S-MANDELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2518-DAVID-S-MANDELL", "first_name": "DAVID S", "last_name": "MANDELL", "id": "2518-DAVID-S-MANDELL", "name": "DAVID S MANDELL"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "23246-301-2518-DAVID-S-MANDELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-052", "path": "/courses/23246", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23246/sections", "values": [{"name": "AUTISM EPIDEMIC", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-052-301", "path": "/courses/23246/sections/301", "id": "23246-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-052-301"]}]}, "id": 23246, "aliases": ["HSOC-052"]}
