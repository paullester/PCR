{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1357"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the basic tenets of epidemiology and how to quantitatively study health at the population level. Students learn about measures used to describe populations with respect to health outcomes and the inherent limitations in these measures and their underlying sources of data. Analytic methods used to test scientific questions about health outcomes in populations then are covered, again paying particular attention to the strength and weaknesses of the various approaches. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "FUNDMTLS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1789/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.09", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "FUNDMTLS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-230-301", "path": "/courses/1789/sections/301", "id": "1789-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-230-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/1789/sections/301/reviews/1871-PETER-A-KANETSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1871-PETER-A-KANETSKY", "first_name": "PETER A", "last_name": "KANETSKY", "id": "1871-PETER-A-KANETSKY", "name": "PETER A KANETSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "1789-301-1871-PETER-A-KANETSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-230", "path": "/courses/1789", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1789/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUNDMTLS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-230-301", "path": "/courses/1789/sections/301", "id": "1789-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-230-301"]}]}, "id": 1789, "aliases": ["HSOC-230"]}
