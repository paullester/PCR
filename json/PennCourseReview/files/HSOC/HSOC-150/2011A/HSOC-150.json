The course emphasizes history of healthcare from the U.S. Civil War to the present day. Major themes addressed include: American public health movements and hospitals; private health insurance like Blue Cross; industrial health and workman\u2019s compensation; the welfare state (in Europe and the U.S.); women\u2019s health; Medicare/Medicaid; the Clinton Health Plan; injured soldiers; and the Veterans Administration.\r\n\r\nIn general, students felt that they learned a lot from both lecture and assigned readings. Coursework was described as \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d \u201cpractical,\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d Students valued the use of anecdotes and case studies as tools for teaching concepts.\r\n\r\nProfessor Linker received stellar reviews from all of her students. Many described her as \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d \u201cinsightful,\u201d and \u201cengaging.\u201d Students remarked on her use of multimedia and humor to create a \u201clight mood\u201d that encouraged active discussion. Though every student considered Professor Linker\u2019s teaching style suitable, there were frequent complaints about her relying on too much assigned reading. Additionally, she had trouble adequately covering all of the reading material during lecture.\r\n\r\nThe course is taken by all kinds of students, especially HSOC majors, and a large portion of the workload is attributed to assigned readings. The class has a midterm, final paper, and final exam. Students who keep up with the readings and partake in class discussions should expect to do well.\r\n", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/21889/sections/401/reviews/3990-BETH-LINKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3990-BETH-LINKER", "first_name": "BETH", "last_name": "LINKER", "id": "3990-BETH-LINKER", "name": "BETH LINKER"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "21889-401-3990-BETH-LINKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-150", "path": "/courses/21889", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21889/sections", "values": [{"name": "AMERICAN HEALTH POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-150-401", "path": "/courses/21889/sections/401", "id": "21889-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-150-401", "SOCI-152-401"]}]}, "id": 21889, "aliases": ["HSOC-150", "SOCI-152"]}
