{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4359"}, "description": "In the sixth century, Boethius introduced the concept of musica humana, in which he described how the harmony of body and soul was reflected in musical sound, and how this sense of harmony contributed to humanity's place in the universe at large. In the twenty-first century, neuroscientists investigate the ways in which music offers insight into the pathways of the brain, and can, in fact, help shape these pathways, thus offering a neural basis for understanding social bonding, cognition, and emotion. The rich, ever-changing relationship between music and medicine is the focus of this course. We will study this relationship as it was articulated at various cultural moments from ancient Greece to the present, with attention devoted to intersections between music and medicine in the West but with consideration also given to other cultural traditions (i.e., shamanism). Topics will include: musics effects on the body and soul, as described by ancient writers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Galen; early modern understandings of music and the humoral body; the history of tarantism, Mesmerism, and other healing methods involving music; the genealogy of music and melancholy; empiricism and emerging conceptions of the nervous, sensing body during the psychology of hearing; and music's signficance for research in neorophysiology & cognitive science. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "MUSIC AND MEDICINE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16155/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.81", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "MUSIC AND MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-095-401", "path": "/courses/16155/sections/401", "id": "16155-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-095-401", "HSOC-095-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/16155/sections/401/reviews/4472-SAMUEL-J-BREENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4472-SAMUEL-J-BREENE", "first_name": "SAMUEL J", "last_name": "BREENE", "id": "4472-SAMUEL-J-BREENE", "name": "SAMUEL J BREENE"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "16155-401-4472-SAMUEL-J-BREENE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-095", "path": "/courses/16155", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16155/sections", "values": [{"name": "MUSIC AND MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-095-401", "path": "/courses/16155/sections/401", "id": "16155-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-095-401", "HSOC-095-401"]}]}, "id": 16155, "aliases": ["MUSC-095", "HSOC-095"]}
