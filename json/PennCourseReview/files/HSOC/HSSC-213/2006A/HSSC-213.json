All of these are elements of a braod set of social, technical and political phenomena generally associated with the emergence of a nascent \"cyberculture\".In this seminar we explore the ways in which recent developments in information technology -- the computer and the Internet in particular -- related to changing contemporary notions of community, identity, property and gender. By looking at an eclectic collection of popular and scholarsly resources including film, fiction and the World Wide Web, we will situate the development of cyberculture in the larger history of the complex relationship between technology and Western society. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "CYBERCULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7907/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.11", "rDifficulty": "1.74", "rStimulateInterest": "3.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.74", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "3.37", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.37", "rCommAbility": "3.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.84"}, "section": {"name": "CYBERCULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-213-401", "path": "/courses/7907/sections/401", "id": "7907-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-213-401", "HSOC-213-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/7907/sections/401/reviews/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "first_name": "NATHAN", "last_name": "ENSMENGER", "id": "664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "name": "NATHAN ENSMENGER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "7907-401-664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-213", "path": "/courses/7907", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7907/sections", "values": [{"name": "CYBERCULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-213-401", "path": "/courses/7907/sections/401", "id": "7907-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-213-401", "HSOC-213-401"]}]}, "id": 7907, "aliases": ["HSSC-213", "HSOC-213"]}
