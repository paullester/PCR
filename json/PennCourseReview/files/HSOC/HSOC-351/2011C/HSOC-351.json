{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4592"}, "description": "This course will examine the nature and history of the doctor-patient relationship from the era of Hippocrates to the present. The doctor-patient relationship has evolved along side the practice of medicine and its institutions. Historical, cultural, scientific, social and economic forces have impacted it and shaped it into what it is today. As the concepts of health and disease are socially and culturally determined, so has the doctor-patient relationship undergone significant social and cultural change. The place the doctor has held in society, as well as the expectations of both the doctor and the patient have changed dramatically in the last century. In addition, striking advances in science and technology and changes in the delivery of healthcare, particularly in the last half of the 20th century, have shaped the pactice of medicine and by necessity have influenced the relationship between doctor and patient. The course will focus primarily on the evolution of the doctor-patient relationshp over the last century from boththe doctor's and patient's perspective. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "DOCTOR-PATIENT RELSHIP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24590/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "1.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.91", "rCourseQuality": "3.24", "rWorkRequired": "1.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "3.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "DOCTOR-PATIENT RELSHIP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-351-301", "path": "/courses/24590/sections/301", "id": "24590-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-351-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/24590/sections/301/reviews/3014-THERESA-A--WALLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3014-THERESA-A--WALLS", "first_name": "THERESA A.", "last_name": "WALLS", "id": "3014-THERESA-A--WALLS", "name": "THERESA A.
