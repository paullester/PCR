Bioethicists work in hospitals on clinical ethics, in medical schools and research facilities on experimentation ethics, in public policy and, more recently, in the political arena. We will also explore bioethical theories and specific issues and cases like stem cell research and the Schiavo controversy, and discuss the history of bioethics. And we will pay close attention to bioethical issues in the media during the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ETHICS, TECH & LIFE SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15927/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "2.09", "rStimulateInterest": "3.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "1.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.45", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "ETHICS, TECH & LIFE SCI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-051-401", "path": "/courses/15927/sections/401", "id": "15927-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-051-401", "STSC-051-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/15927/sections/401/reviews/4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO", "first_name": "JONATHAN D", "last_name": "MORENO", "id": "4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO", "name": "JONATHAN D MORENO"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "15927-401-4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-051", "path": "/courses/15927", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15927/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHICS, TECH & LIFE SCI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-051-401", "path": "/courses/15927/sections/401", "id": "15927-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-051-401", "STSC-051-401"]}]}, "id": 15927, "aliases": ["HSOC-051", "STSC-051"]}
