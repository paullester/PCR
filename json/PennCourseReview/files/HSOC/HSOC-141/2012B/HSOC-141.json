{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5491"}, "description": "From/28 Days Later/to the Center for Disease Control's \"Zombie Apocalypse Preparedness Guide,\" zombies express our cultural anxieties and how we deal with them. Many of these fears focus on\"Cybernetic Utopianism: The Politics of the systems of knowledge and expertise that we use to know and control them.Using centuries of \"zombie culture\" as a lens, this course surveys the history of western medical knowledge and practice from antiquity to the present, with a particular focus on the technologies that have been used to manage bodies. We will read primary sources (including elite medical texts, patients' accounts, and devise advertisements) to examine the history of medical knowledge and medical tools. This approach provides historical and anthropological context for zombie media, and it uses entertainment and cultural fears as a way to understand the conerns and experiences of historical figures -- including patients, caregivers, and policy-makers -- on their own terms. \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "ZOMBIE'S HIST MED & TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28369/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ZOMBIE'S HIST MED & TECH", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "HSOC-141-910", "path": "/courses/28369/sections/910", "id": "28369-910", "aliases": ["HSOC-141-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/28369/sections/910/reviews/6206-DEANNA-M-DAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6206-DEANNA-M-DAY", "first_name": "DEANNA M", "last_name": "DAY", "id": "6206-DEANNA-M-DAY", "name": "DEANNA M DAY"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "28369-910-6206-DEANNA-M-DAY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-141", "path": "/courses/28369", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28369/sections", "values": [{"name": "ZOMBIE'S HIST MED & TECH", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "HSOC-141-910", "path": "/courses/28369/sections/910", "id": "28369-910", "aliases": ["HSOC-141-910"]}]}, "id": 28369, "aliases": ["HSOC-141"]}
