{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5272"}, "description": "This course explores the social, cultural and political contexts of scientific knowledge in China over the course of two millennia, through a diverse cast of historica actors spanning emperors and midwives, Buddhist monks and Jesuits, eminent authorities and everyday people. We will examine the evoliutio of various learned traditions (astronomy, alchemy, medicine, natural history) that sought to define and understand the heavens, the earth and the body - and the manner in which those forms of knowledge could be deployed for the good of state, society or individual. In the process, we will compare Chinese experience to other cultures and evaluate the status and dynamics of Chinese traditions in the modern era of Western political and scientific dominance. No prior knowledge of Chinese history is assumed. Class discussion will be a part of each meeting. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CHINESE SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25179/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "CHINESE SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STSC-152-001", "path": "/courses/25179/sections/001", "id": "25179-001", "aliases": ["STSC-152-001", "HSOC-157-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/25179/sections/001/reviews/1486-IAN-C--PETRIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1486-IAN-C--PETRIE", "first_name": "IAN C.", "last_name": "PETRIE", "id": "1486-IAN-C--PETRIE", "name": "IAN C.
