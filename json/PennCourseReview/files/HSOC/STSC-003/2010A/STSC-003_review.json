This unique, abiding and often tumultuous relationship is one of the defining elements of the American experience. From factory floor to suburban kitchens, from eccentric inventors to student demonstrators, from Model T to iMacs, the diversity of American technological developments reflects -- and has helped define -- the most crucial developments in American history. This course will provide a historical understanding of the role that technology has played in American society from the late 19th century to the present day. The underlying assumption is that technology is simultaneously a reflection and cultural values, and a factor (one of many) in shaping the continuous development of those values.\r\n\r\nMany students found the subject matter of this class to be very interesting. While they noted that the course could often become somewhat \u201cdull,\u201d many also said that material learned from this class will change their perspective of the \u201crelationship between people and the technology they use.\u201d In addition, students said that they foresee being able to discuss concepts from this course in conversation. Many said that it was important to know that this course is history-based, and not as much focused on modern day technology.\r\n\r\nStudents said Professor Ensminger was a great lecturer overall. Some students complained that he \u201cdid not seem to want to discuss the course outside of class\u201d and that his lectures sometimes grew tedious. Others thought that his \u201cunique lecturing style was particularly effective\u201d and that he was overall \u201carticulate.\u201d Some warned that he speaks very quickly, so a laptop is usually necessary for note-taking, and since there is no textbook for the course, you have to attend lecture and pay attention. Professor Ensminger is an especially good lecturer \u201cwhen he [discusses] his area of expertise (computers).\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students complained about the grading system in this class and that the \u201cexams were far too specific to be fair.\u201d They said that there was an overwhelming amount of reading and that it was impossible to read all of it, so students were forced to pick which information to learn. One student reported that \u201cthe curve made it hard to enjoy the course.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 163, "path": "/courses/26820/sections/401/reviews/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "first_name": "NATHAN", "last_name": "ENSMENGER", "id": "664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "name": "NATHAN ENSMENGER"}, "num_reviewers": 151, "id": "26820-401-664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER"}]
