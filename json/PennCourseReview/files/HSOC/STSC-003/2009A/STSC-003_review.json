It examines the origins and impacts of technical developments throughout human history and across the globe, paying attention to the aesthetic, religious and mythical dimensions of technological change as well as the circumstances in which innovations emerge and their effects on social order, the environment, and how humans understand themselves. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nWith \u201cstimulating lectures and wonderful content,\u201d this course received top reviews across the board. Students felt they learned a lot and appreciated the breadth of the course, such as its spanning of eastern as well as western history. However, a handful mentioned that too much of the course focused on ancient history; they would have liked to spend more time on the modern era and current ideas. &#8232;\r\n&#8232;Professor Tresch is an \u201camazing professor\u201d and \u201csweet guy\u201d whose enthusiasm keeps students engaged. He is \u201cexcited about the material he\u2019s teaching, which is refreshing to see,\u201d and he tries hard to make this large lecture as participatory as possible. &#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents are graded on three quizzes, four written responses, a group project, and a final exam.
