These factors include disease environment, medical technology, public health initiatives, and personal behaviors. The approach is comparative and historical and includes attention to differences in health levels among major social groups.\r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201cexcellent\u201d and reported learning \u201ca tremendous amount from it.\u201d Most described the material as \u201cvery interesting,\u201d but some students noted that the lectures were \u201credundant of the readings,\u201d which made them \u201ca little dull.\u201d Students found assignments and lectures useful for \u201creinforcing concepts\u201d and \u201ccapturing main ideas.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents heaped praise on Professor Kohler, describing him as an \u201cexceptionally good teacher\u201d with a strong understanding of the material he was teaching.
