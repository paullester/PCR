{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1358"}, "description": "What is disease? In this seminar students will ask and answer this question by analyzing historical documents, scientific reports, and historical scholarship (primarily 19th and 20th century U.S. and European). We will look at disease from multiple perspectives -- as a biological process, clinical entity, population phenomenon, historical actor and personal experience. We will pay special attention to how diseases have been recognized, diagnosed, named and classified in different eras, cultures and professional settings. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DISEASE & SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29119/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "DISEASE & SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-430-301", "path": "/courses/29119/sections/301", "id": "29119-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-430-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/29119/sections/301/reviews/1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "first_name": "ROBERT A.", "last_name": "ARONOWITZ", "id": "1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "name": "ROBERT A.
