The course will include a focus on policies and regulations related to firearms, the primary mechanism by which violence-releated fatalities occur in the U.S. We will address the life span of a gun, from design and manufacture through to use. In addition, we will address key aspects of the social context in which firearms exist and within which firearm policy is made. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "GUNS & HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17543/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.58", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.08", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "GUNS & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-471-401", "path": "/courses/17543/sections/401", "id": "17543-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-471-401", "PUBH-534-401", "STSC-471-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/17543/sections/401/reviews/3927-SUSAN-SORENSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3927-SUSAN-SORENSON", "first_name": "SUSAN", "last_name": "SORENSON", "id": "3927-SUSAN-SORENSON", "name": "SUSAN SORENSON"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "17543-401-3927-SUSAN-SORENSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-471", "path": "/courses/17543", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17543/sections", "values": [{"name": "GUNS & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-471-401", "path": "/courses/17543/sections/401", "id": "17543-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-471-401", "PUBH-534-401", "STSC-471-401"]}]}, "id": 17543, "aliases": ["HSOC-471", "PUBH-534", "STSC-471"]}
