{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1027"}, "description": "The countries of South Asia have large and diverse populations in need of public, preventative, and curative health services relavant to the health and disease problems of the region. This course will consider the historic origins of health services in South Asia, beginning with a focus on health needs and health services' development in the 19th century through the mid-20th century. In a context influenced by politics, economics, and socio-cultural factors, biomedical health services and education emerged as the dominant health system. Yet this system remains tied to foreign health models and contends with the socio-cultural competition of traditional medical systems. Through lectures, discussion, and assignments, this course will explore the historic and contemporary complexity of the health care systems in South Asian countires as they attempt to deliver health care to populations with wide disparities in income, education, health problems and needs. Selected comparative experiences of Asian health care systems, such as Chinese, will be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "HEALTH&SOCIETY IN S.ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4699/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH&SOCIETY IN S.ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-305-401", "path": "/courses/4699/sections/401", "id": "4699-401", "aliases": ["SARS-305-401", "HSOC-305-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/4699/sections/401/reviews/1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN", "first_name": "HELEN", "last_name": "SHEEHAN", "id": "1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN", "name": "HELEN SHEEHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "4699-401-1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-305", "path": "/courses/4699", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4699/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTH&SOCIETY IN S.ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-305-401", "path": "/courses/4699/sections/401", "id": "4699-401", "aliases": ["SARS-305-401", "HSOC-305-401"]}]}, "id": 4699, "aliases": ["SARS-305", "HSOC-305"]}
