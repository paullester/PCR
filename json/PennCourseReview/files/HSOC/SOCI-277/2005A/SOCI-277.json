{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2925"}, "description": "This course is designed to give a general overview of how sociologists study mental illness. We will be concerned with describing the contributions of sociological research and exploring how these contributions differ from those of psychology, psychiatry, and social work. This overview will be done in three parts: we will discuss (i) what \"mental illness\" is, (ii) precisely how many Americans are mentally ill, (iii) how social factors (e.g. race, gender, class) and social arrangements (e.g. social networks) lead to mental illness, and (iv) how we as a society respond to and treat the mentally ill. Throughout the course, we will be concerned with uncovering the assumptions behind difffent definitions of mental health and exploring their political, social, and legal implications. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "MENTAL ILLNESS: Insane, Irrational, or Ill: The Sociology of Mental Illness", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11003/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.05", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.84", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "MENTAL ILLNESS: Insane, Irrational, or Ill: The Sociology of Mental Illness", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-277-401", "path": "/courses/11003/sections/401", "id": "11003-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-277-401", "HSOC-277-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/11003/sections/401/reviews/1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER", "first_name": "JASON", "last_name": "SCHNITTKER", "id": "1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER", "name": "JASON SCHNITTKER"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "11003-401-1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-277", "path": "/courses/11003", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11003/sections", "values": [{"name": "MENTAL ILLNESS: Insane, Irrational, or Ill: The Sociology of Mental Illness", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-277-401", "path": "/courses/11003/sections/401", "id": "11003-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-277-401", "HSOC-277-401"]}]}, "id": 11003, "aliases": ["SOCI-277", "HSOC-277"]}
