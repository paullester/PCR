{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4059"}, "description": "According to the latest statistics, almost one-fifth of Americans are disabled. Whether able-bodied or not, all of us encounter disability policy at work on a daily basis-from handicap parking and automated doors to accessible drinking fountains. The purpose of this seminar will be to explore the history of disability as a lived-experience, as the basis for nineteenth-century \"freak shows,\" as a medical diagnosis, as a common outcome of America's wars, and as a personal identifier that has sparked political controversy and activism throughout the last two hundred years. Some of the topics in this course will include the history of the \"normal\" body, plastic surgery, prosthetic design and engineering, eugenics, the development of the Veteran's hospital system, as well as the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "DISABILITY IN HIST PERSP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14671/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "DISABILITY IN HIST PERSP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-041-301", "path": "/courses/14671/sections/301", "id": "14671-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-041-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/14671/sections/301/reviews/3990-BETH-LINKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3990-BETH-LINKER", "first_name": "BETH", "last_name": "LINKER", "id": "3990-BETH-LINKER", "name": "BETH LINKER"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "14671-301-3990-BETH-LINKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-041", "path": "/courses/14671", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14671/sections", "values": [{"name": "DISABILITY IN HIST PERSP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-041-301", "path": "/courses/14671/sections/301", "id": "14671-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-041-301"]}]}, "id": 14671, "aliases": ["HSOC-041"]}
