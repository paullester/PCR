{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3945"}, "description": "From the establishment of the Delhi sultinate in the 13th c. until the fall of the Mughals in the 19th c., South Asia was a fertile ground for Persianate linguistic and artistic production. The urban discourses of the subcontinent were shaped by the cultural practices that emerged from the complex interaction between Persian and Indic cultural systems. Through the fourteenth century, the power of the Delhi sultinate declined and its political and religious constituencies became localized. This course will explore the complex cultural interactions between Delhi and the wider Dar al Islam on the one hand and with indigenous groups and local culture on the other. It will use both literary and material sources. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "HEALTH POLICY IN SA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13869/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "1.81", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.14", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.48", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.76", "rCommAbility": "2.62", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH POLICY IN SA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-385-401", "path": "/courses/13869/sections/401", "id": "13869-401", "aliases": ["SAST-385-401", "SAST-685-401", "HSOC-410-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/13869/sections/401/reviews/1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN", "first_name": "HELEN", "last_name": "SHEEHAN", "id": "1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN", "name": "HELEN SHEEHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "13869-401-1079-HELEN-SHEEHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-385", "path": "/courses/13869", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13869/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTH POLICY IN SA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-385-401", "path": "/courses/13869/sections/401", "id": "13869-401", "aliases": ["SAST-385-401", "SAST-685-401", "HSOC-410-401"]}]}, "id": 13869, "aliases": ["SAST-385", "SAST-685", "HSOC-410"]}
