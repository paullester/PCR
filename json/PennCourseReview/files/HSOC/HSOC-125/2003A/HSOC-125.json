{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1356"}, "description": "This course will explore the history of the long, intimate and often combustible relationship between law and medicine in the United States. Turning to these two intellectual disciplines with great regularity, Americans have sought solutions to a vast array of social, political, economic and moral problems. This mode of problem solving often involved legal and medical practioners as well as the general public, in protracted and divisive cultural debates over such issues as the definition of death and the meaning of sanity. Using evidence from historical sources contemporary journalism and policy discussions, literature and film, students explore both the nature of the medical-legal relationship and its importance to American culture. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "LAW AND MEDICINE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1788/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.84", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "2.95", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.48", "rReadingsValue": "3.03", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.35", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "LAW AND MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-125-401", "path": "/courses/1788/sections/401", "id": "1788-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-125-401", "HSSC-125-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/1788/sections/401/reviews/661-JANET-TIGHE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/661-JANET-TIGHE", "first_name": "JANET", "last_name": "TIGHE", "id": "661-JANET-TIGHE", "name": "JANET TIGHE"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "1788-401-661-JANET-TIGHE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-125", "path": "/courses/1788", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1788/sections", "values": [{"name": "LAW AND MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-125-401", "path": "/courses/1788/sections/401", "id": "1788-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-125-401", "HSSC-125-401"]}]}, "id": 1788, "aliases": ["HSOC-125", "HSSC-125"]}
