{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5053"}, "description": "Darwin's conceptions of evolution have become a central organizing principle of modern biology. This lecture course will explore the origins and emergence of his ideas, the scientific work they provoked, and their subsequent re-emergence into modern evolutionary theory. In order to understand the living world, students will have the opportunity to read and engage with various classic primary sources by Darwin, Mendel, and others. The course willconclude with guest lectures on evolutionary biology today, emphasizing currentissues, new methods, and recent discoveries. In short, this is a lecture course on the emergence of modern evolutionary biology--its central ideas, their historical development and their implications for the human future. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "DARWIN'S LEGACY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25178/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.46", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "1.88", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "2.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.43"}, "section": {"name": "DARWIN'S LEGACY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-123-401", "path": "/courses/25178/sections/401", "id": "25178-401", "aliases": ["STSC-123-401", "HSOC-123-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/25178/sections/401/reviews/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "first_name": "MARK B", "last_name": "ADAMS", "id": "663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "name": "MARK B ADAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "25178-401-663-MARK-B-ADAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-123", "path": "/courses/25178", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25178/sections", "values": [{"name": "DARWIN'S LEGACY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-123-401", "path": "/courses/25178/sections/401", "id": "25178-401", "aliases": ["STSC-123-401", "HSOC-123-401"]}]}, "id": 25178, "aliases": ["STSC-123", "HSOC-123"]}
