{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2324"}, "description": "This seminar focuses on the tremendous disparities that exist in the health status of contemporary Americans. Led by a practicing physician who is actively engaged in training family practice residents, the course ask students to explore the current evidence for health disparities that exist in the United States and the role played by such factors as gender, race, geographic area, and socioeconomic status. Students will explore a broad gamut of societal factors -- nutrition, literacy, education, role-modeling and mentoring -- and the subsequent effects that these disparities have on the health of individuals and communities. Individually and in teams, students will evaluate a set of programs that address these disparities. These evaluations will include site visits to several such programs based in Philadelphia. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "UNEQUAL TREATMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4282/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "1.69", "rStimulateInterest": "1.65", "rRecommendMajor": "1.58", "rCourseQuality": "1.77", "rWorkRequired": "1.69", "rInstructorAccess": "1.62", "rReadingsValue": "2.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.23", "rCommAbility": "1.85", "rInstructorQuality": "1.58"}, "section": {"name": "UNEQUAL TREATMENT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-015-301", "path": "/courses/4282/sections/301", "id": "4282-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-015-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/4282/sections/301/reviews/2181-JUDITH-FISHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2181-JUDITH-FISHER", "first_name": "JUDITH", "last_name": "FISHER", "id": "2181-JUDITH-FISHER", "name": "JUDITH FISHER"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "4282-301-2181-JUDITH-FISHER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-015", "path": "/courses/4282", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4282/sections", "values": [{"name": "UNEQUAL TREATMENT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-015-301", "path": "/courses/4282/sections/301", "id": "4282-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-015-301"]}]}, "id": 4282, "aliases": ["HSOC-015"]}
