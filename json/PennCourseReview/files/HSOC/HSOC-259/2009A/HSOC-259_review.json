The class covers topics such as the social context of health, the emergence of integrative medicine, ethnicity and ethnomedicine, spirituality and health, and belief systems.\r\nOverwhelmingly students liked this \u201cexcellent\u201d class. Saying that it \u201cchanged my preconceived notions on health.\u201d Students appreciate that the class balanced lecture with discussion and found the subject of alternative medicine \u201cextremely\u201d interesting. \u201cEven if you have taken related courses on the subject, you are bound to discover something new,\u201d said one student. Another added that \u201cit would serve a lot of pre-meds well to get an overview of CAM therapies that exist.\u201d\r\nProfessor Mackenzie is described as \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201cextremely knowledgeable.\u201d The tone set by Professor Mackenzie is relaxed and comfortable, encouraging students to express their opinions. One student complimented her on her \u201cability to explain esoteric concepts in accessible terms,\u201d but another felt that \u201cshe did not answer questions with relevant answers...and relied too much on videos to teach the class.\u201d\r\nThis class provides a \u201cnice crash course/into to a broad subject\u201d of alternative medicine. Many premed students took the course in the past and found the class to be useful for those interested in a medical profession. Readings are said to be a bit repetitive and are not assigned far enough in advance. The term paper and class participation make up the majority of a student\u2019s grade.", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/15929/sections/601/reviews/1440-ELIZABETH-R--MACKENZIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1440-ELIZABETH-R--MACKENZIE", "first_name": "ELIZABETH R.", "last_name": "MACKENZIE", "id": "1440-ELIZABETH-R--MACKENZIE", "name": "ELIZABETH R.
