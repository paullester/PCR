{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2325"}, "description": "Bioethical conundrums such as cloning, stem cells, transplantation, the use of psychopharmaceuticals, end of life technologies, preimplantation diagnosis of embroyos, artificial reproductive technologies, and the genetic manipulation of life will challenge policy-makers and moral thinkers throughout the twenty-first century. In this course, a philosopher and a sociologist team up to frame and explore these important issues. Guest lecturers, multimedia presentations, and spirited debate will allow the students to understand the science, the social implications, and the philosophical, ethical, and religious implications of the coming biotechnological revolution. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "BIOETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26227/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.84", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.74", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.13", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "BIOETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-102-401", "path": "/courses/26227/sections/401", "id": "26227-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-102-401", "SOCI-101-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 82, "path": "/courses/26227/sections/401/reviews/4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO", "first_name": "JONATHAN D", "last_name": "MORENO", "id": "4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO", "name": "JONATHAN D MORENO"}, "num_reviewers": 75, "id": "26227-401-4186-JONATHAN-D-MORENO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-102", "path": "/courses/26227", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26227/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-102-401", "path": "/courses/26227/sections/401", "id": "26227-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-102-401", "SOCI-101-401"]}]}, "id": 26227, "aliases": ["HSOC-102", "SOCI-101"]}
