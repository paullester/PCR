In this course, a philosopher and a sociologist team up to frame and explore these important issues. Guest lecturers, multimedia presentations, and spirited debates will allow the students to understand the science, the social implications, and the philosophical, ethical, and religious implications of the coming biotechnological revolution.\r\n\r\nStudents loved the \"philosophical approach to bioethical issues.\" They found the course \"fascinating,\" and they \"truly enjoyed going to class.\" The class was \"very contemporary and forward-looking.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Moreno is \"a talented, dedicated, and enthusiastic professor\" and the \u201cepitome of interdisciplinary work.\" He \"communicates the course material well and creates an engaging class environment.\" He is a \"well-versed professor and leader in his field.
