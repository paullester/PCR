{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2325"}, "description": "This course is intended to introduce students to the fundamental principles of bioethics and the many ethical issues that arise in the rapidly changing fields of biomedicine and the life sciences. The first half of the course willprovide an overview of the standard philosophical principles of bioethics, using clinical case studies to help illustrate and work through these principles. In the second half of the course we will focus on recent biomedical topics that have engendered much public controversy including diagnostic genetics, reproductive technologies and prenatal sceening, abortion, physician assisted suicide, human experiments, and end of life decision making. We will use the principles learned in the first half of the course to systematically think through these bioethical issues, many of which affect our everyday lives. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "BIOETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30477/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.91", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.04", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "BIOETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-102-401", "path": "/courses/30477/sections/401", "id": "30477-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-102-401", "SOCI-101-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/30477/sections/401/reviews/6511-JESSICA-MOZERSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6511-JESSICA-MOZERSKY", "first_name": "JESSICA", "last_name": "MOZERSKY", "id": "6511-JESSICA-MOZERSKY", "name": "JESSICA MOZERSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "30477-401-6511-JESSICA-MOZERSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-102", "path": "/courses/30477", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30477/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-102-401", "path": "/courses/30477/sections/401", "id": "30477-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-102-401", "SOCI-101-401"]}]}, "id": 30477, "aliases": ["HSOC-102", "SOCI-101"]}
