{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3898"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to the historical development of medical ethics and to the birth of bioethics in the twentieth-century United States. We will examine how and why medical ethical issues arose in American society at this time. Themes will include human experimentation, organ donation, the rise of medical technology and euthanasia. Finally, this course will examine the contention that the current discipline of bioethics is a purely American phenomenon that has been exported to Great Britain, Canada and Continental Europe. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "HISTORY OF BIOETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13426/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.46", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.54", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.15", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.62"}, "section": {"name": "HISTORY OF BIOETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-140-401", "path": "/courses/13426/sections/401", "id": "13426-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-140-401", "STSC-148-401"]}, "comments": "Students enjoyed Professor\\'s Linker class.
