{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5230"}, "description": "This seminar will explore a wide range of themes at the intersection of globalization and therapeutic cultures in South Asia and amongst South Asian diasporas. To begin with the course understands 'supraterritoriality' as the key feature of globalization and proceeds to interrogate the myriad ways in which this supraterritoriality was produced, consumed, used an dabused within the therapeutic cultures that have been, andon occasion still are, available in so uth Asia-both in reality and symbolically. Each week, through a specific case study, framed by a few theoretical readings, we will attempt to deepen and problematize the simple definition of globalization with which we start the course. Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on combining case study-based empirical material with theoretical interventions in Cultural Theory and Postcolonial Studies. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "GLOBAL MED S.
