{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1937"}, "description": "Until very recently no society's physicians, seeking to understand the contents of the living human body, could do better than construct a disciplined fantasy. The raw materials of this fantasy were what experts knew about the insides of cadavers, what people felt going on inside them and, equally important, notions of order and process in the world of Nature and in society. The results were remarkabley diverse, as we learn not only from comparing the medicine of different cultures, but from looking at discourse about the body at different times in the same culture. In each case we can reconstruct the relations between the lay imagination, medicine, cosmology and values. We will draw on tools that many disciplines--from literary analysis tosocial theory to history of Chinese medicine--apply to the study of the body. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MEDICINE AND THE BODY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4297/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "2.90", "rCourseQuality": "2.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "MEDICINE AND THE BODY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-414-301", "path": "/courses/4297/sections/301", "id": "4297-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-414-301", "SOCI-514-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/4297/sections/301/reviews/1518-NATHAN-SIVIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1518-NATHAN-SIVIN", "first_name": "NATHAN", "last_name": "SIVIN", "id": "1518-NATHAN-SIVIN", "name": "NATHAN SIVIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "4297-301-1518-NATHAN-SIVIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-414", "path": "/courses/4297", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4297/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDICINE AND THE BODY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSSC-414-301", "path": "/courses/4297/sections/301", "id": "4297-301", "aliases": ["HSSC-414-301", "SOCI-514-301"]}]}, "id": 4297, "aliases": ["HSSC-414", "SOCI-514"]}
