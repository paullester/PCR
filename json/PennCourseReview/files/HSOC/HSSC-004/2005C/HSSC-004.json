{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3754"}, "description": "The aim of this course is to develop a sense of how science (including medicine) evolved by reading and discussing important books from antiquity to the late nineteenth century. The sources to be read have been chosen for the quality of ideas expressed in them, their inherent interest, and their accessibility to readers not expert in science. In class we will discuss the readings and your writing about them. You can develop skills in close and critical reading, in intellectual conversation, and in using writing to clarify understanding. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "CLASSICS OF SCI & MED", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11990/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.58", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "CLASSICS OF SCI & MED", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-004-401", "path": "/courses/11990/sections/401", "id": "11990-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-004-401", "HSOC-004-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/11990/sections/401/reviews/1518-NATHAN-SIVIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1518-NATHAN-SIVIN", "first_name": "NATHAN", "last_name": "SIVIN", "id": "1518-NATHAN-SIVIN", "name": "NATHAN SIVIN"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "11990-401-1518-NATHAN-SIVIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-004", "path": "/courses/11990", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11990/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLASSICS OF SCI & MED", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-004-401", "path": "/courses/11990/sections/401", "id": "11990-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-004-401", "HSOC-004-401"]}]}, "id": 11990, "aliases": ["HSSC-004", "HSOC-004"]}
