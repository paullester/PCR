{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4590"}, "description": "Global health is an increasingly popular goal for many modern leaders. Yet critics see evidence of a new imperialism in various aid programs. We ill examine the evolution over time and place of programs designed to improve the health of underserved populations. Traditionally catergorized as public health programs or efforts to achieve a just society, these programs often produce results that are inconsistent with these goals. We will examine the benefits and risks of past programs and conceptualize future partnerships on both a local and global stage. Students should expect to question broadly held beliefs about the common good and service. Ultimately we will examine the concept of partnership and the notion of community health, in which ownership, control, and goals are shared between outside expert and inside community member. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "MED MISSIONARIES & PARTN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24581/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.56", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "1.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "MED MISSIONARIES & PARTN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-059-301", "path": "/courses/24581/sections/301", "id": "24581-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-059-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/24581/sections/301/reviews/4377-KENT-D-W--BREAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4377-KENT-D-W--BREAM", "first_name": "KENT D.W.", "last_name": "BREAM", "id": "4377-KENT-D-W--BREAM", "name": "KENT D.W.
