{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5336"}, "description": "During the Cold War, science, technology and medicine occupied a central place in the developing and maintianing state power. The incorporation of science into the apparatus of the Cold War state changed the ways that scientists studied, worked, and communicated with each other and the public. But beyond such practical concern, scientists in both the United States and the Soviet Union had to confront the question of what it meant to pursue natural knowledge in a militarized state. No nation or politcal system could survive without the weapons, medicine, foodstuffs, and consumer producers made possible by modern scientific research--yet science was supposedly an international system free from the dicates of politics. Tis course explores the contradictions of Cold War science and medicine. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "COLD WAR SCI & MEDICINE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26234/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "COLD WAR SCI & MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-431-401", "path": "/courses/26234/sections/401", "id": "26234-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-431-401", "STSC-431-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/26234/sections/401/reviews/4996-AUDRA-J-WOLFE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4996-AUDRA-J-WOLFE", "first_name": "AUDRA J", "last_name": "WOLFE", "id": "4996-AUDRA-J-WOLFE", "name": "AUDRA J WOLFE"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "26234-401-4996-AUDRA-J-WOLFE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-431", "path": "/courses/26234", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26234/sections", "values": [{"name": "COLD WAR SCI & MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-431-401", "path": "/courses/26234/sections/401", "id": "26234-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-431-401", "STSC-431-401"]}]}, "id": 26234, "aliases": ["HSOC-431", "STSC-431"]}
