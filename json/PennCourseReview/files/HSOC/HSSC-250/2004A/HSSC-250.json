It will focus on a set of questions: to what extent is mental illness socially constructed? How does society arrive at its concepts of and attitudes towards both emotional and behavioral disturbance as well as notions of adjustment and normality? The asylum movement of the nineteenth century, the rise of psychiatry as a medical specialty, the role of the media and lay public in shaping its identity, legal issues such as commitment and competence, as well as the development of psychopharmacology & an increasingly biologically based psychiatry in the twentieth century will be examined. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "SOC HIST MENTAL ILLNESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6710/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "SOC HIST MENTAL ILLNESS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HSSC-250-601", "path": "/courses/6710/sections/601", "id": "6710-601", "aliases": ["HSSC-250-601", "HSOC-250-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/6710/sections/601/reviews/2783-CHLOE-BETH-SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2783-CHLOE-BETH-SILVERMAN", "first_name": "CHLOE BETH", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "2783-CHLOE-BETH-SILVERMAN", "name": "CHLOE BETH SILVERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "6710-601-2783-CHLOE-BETH-SILVERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-250", "path": "/courses/6710", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6710/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOC HIST MENTAL ILLNESS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HSSC-250-601", "path": "/courses/6710/sections/601", "id": "6710-601", "aliases": ["HSSC-250-601", "HSOC-250-601"]}]}, "id": 6710, "aliases": ["HSSC-250", "HSOC-250"]}
