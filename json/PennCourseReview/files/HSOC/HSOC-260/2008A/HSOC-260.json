{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3416"}, "description": "Over the last century, we have witnessed dramatic historical change in population health, e.g. rising numbeers of obese Americans and dramatic declines in death from stomach cancer. There has also been highly visible social patterning of health and disease, such as socio-economic disparities in AIDS, substance abuse, and asthma in the U.S. to day or the association of breat cancer with affluence around the world. This course will explore the way researchers and others in past and present have tried to make sense of these patterns and do something about them. The course is historical and sociological. We will examine evidence and theories about how poverty, affluence and other social factors influence health AND we will examine how social and historical forces shape the ways in which health and disease are understood. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "SOC DETERMINANTS HLTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20368/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.04", "rInstructorAccess": "3.72", "rReadingsValue": "3.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "SOC DETERMINANTS HLTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-260-401", "path": "/courses/20368/sections/401", "id": "20368-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-260-401", "SOCI-259-401", "STSC-150-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/20368/sections/401/reviews/1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "first_name": "ROBERT A.", "last_name": "ARONOWITZ", "id": "1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "name": "ROBERT A.
