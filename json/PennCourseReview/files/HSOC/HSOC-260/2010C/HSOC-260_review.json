What accounts for these patterns? What can be done about them? Students sought answers to these questions by comparing theoretical and empiric investigations of health from different disciplines, levels of description (individuals, neighborhoods, populations), societies and historical periods. The goal of this course was to introduce students to the study of the multiple determinants of the health of individuals and societies. &#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed the \u201centertaining,\u201d \u201cinformative,\u201d and \u201cvery interesting\u201d material of the course. The students also appreciated the usefulness of the information taught as \u201cessential concepts needed in any public health career.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nThe students all enjoyed Professor Aronowitz\u2019s teaching \u201cbecause he's very fair and always makes [students] think outside of the box.\u201d Students described him as \u201cpassionate,\u201d both about the subject matter and about teaching his students. Students also called him \u201cstimulating,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201cawesome.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nNon-majors and majors took this class, and both groups of students enjoyed it. One student recommended students just starting their major should take the class, \u201csince a lot of the material gets covered more in-depth in later courses in the major.\u201d Students enjoyed the \u201cdiscussion oriented\u201d aspect of the class, but would have liked more guidance on their final project, a research grant proposal. Students also felt that the course \u201clacked structure as we would jump from topic to topic in an almost incoherent fashion.\u201d Students, though, appreciated the guest lecturers who came to speak to the class.\r\n", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/23251/sections/401/reviews/1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "first_name": "ROBERT A.", "last_name": "ARONOWITZ", "id": "1872-ROBERT-A--ARONOWITZ", "name": "ROBERT A.
