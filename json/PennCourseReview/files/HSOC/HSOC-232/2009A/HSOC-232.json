The field of social epidemiology examines the finluence of workplace, neighborhood,social relationships, and other nonbiological factors on health outcomes. This course gives students the skills to explore and assess complex health challenges that are seen in popular media and public discourse by examining such factors as healthcare access,social inequality,racism and discrimination,and trust and social captal. Using readings, videos and interactive discussions with a focus on emergent health issues, this course equips students to diagnose and interpret underlying reasons for poor health using social epidemiological tools,and to consider practical inverventions to address those fundamental causes of illness. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15928/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "3.45", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.23", "rWorkRequired": "2.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "3.32", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-232-301", "path": "/courses/15928/sections/301", "id": "15928-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-232-301"]}, "comments": "This course combines an in depth study of epidemiological theory with social thinking.\r\n\u201cThe course was structured differently than other courses at Penn and was more of a lab environment, which turned out to be a great experience,\u201d said one student.
