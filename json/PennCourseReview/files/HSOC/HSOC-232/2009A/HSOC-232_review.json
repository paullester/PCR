Others appreciated the theory and practical skills presented and said that they learned a lot through creating and completely their own research project. However, some students did criticize the lack of organization and said that the class often felt \u201cvery ad hoc.\u201d One summed up the difficulty by saying, \u201cProfessor Cannuscio believes in allowing students to decide how to structure their assignments and how to present them. This \\'openness\\' often conflicted with many students\\' desire for structure and guidelines, often creating confusion within us as to what the instructor was exactly asking of us to do.\r\n\r\nStudents raved about Professor Cannuscio who they described as \u201csupportive\u201d and \u201cthe most enthusiastic and genuinely caring professor.\u201d She is lauded for her approachability and commitment.\r\nSome students though the workload seemed a bit heavy at first, but the syllabus was not strictly followed, providing more flexibility. Assignments are criticized for being a bit vague and disconnected from the class, and two assigned books were never discussed.", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/15928/sections/301/reviews/4378-CAROLYN-C--CANNUSCIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4378-CAROLYN-C--CANNUSCIO", "first_name": "CAROLYN C.", "last_name": "CANNUSCIO", "id": "4378-CAROLYN-C--CANNUSCIO", "name": "CAROLYN C.
