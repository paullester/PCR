{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3662"}, "description": "The American use of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagaski Japan in August of 1945 was a pivotal event in twentieth-century history. In this seminar we explore how and why this new weaspon was developed and used. We look at how it was interpreted by those who built it and by those who survived it in Japan.And we consider what its existence has meant for politics and culture since 1945. Readings include artistic and literary works dealing with the bomb, autobiographies of scientists of Los Alamos, and a broad range of scholarly work. We close with a consideration of the cultural dynamics of the Smithsonian Enola Gay fiasco. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "THE ATOMIC BOMB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10580/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.45", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "THE ATOMIC BOMB", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-312-401", "path": "/courses/10580/sections/401", "id": "10580-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-312-401", "HSOC-311-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/10580/sections/401/reviews/3660-MICHAEL-A--DENNIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3660-MICHAEL-A--DENNIS", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "DENNIS", "id": "3660-MICHAEL-A--DENNIS", "name": "MICHAEL A.
