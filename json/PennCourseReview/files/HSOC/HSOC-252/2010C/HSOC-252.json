Students will learn how the law's regulatory powers have been used to set boundaries in medicine and, in turn, how medical practice and theory have informed modern legal develoments. The field of health care law sits at a crossroads where many of life's \"big questions\" converge, and consequently is shaped, more than any other legal discipline, by social, ethical, cultural and economic influences. By the end of this course, students should have an understanding both of the current state of American health law, and of the social forces that have shaped its historical development. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "LAW AND MEDICINE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23250/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.61", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "LAW AND MEDICINE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-252-301", "path": "/courses/23250/sections/301", "id": "23250-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-252-301"]}, "comments": "This course is intended to give students an in-depth understanding of the ways in which medical practice and medical decision-making are guided by modern American law.
