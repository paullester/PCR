{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5548"}, "description": "This course will provide University of Pennsylvania and a local Philadelphia High Scjool students with the opportunity to learn fundamental biology concepts amnd apply them in a hands-on, inquiry-based approach that is also attentive to society, history and social context. Biological sciences have long been deeply engaged with social issues, and our topics for this course reflect their relevance to everyday life. Topics of this course will include, but are not limited to, cell development and stem cell biology, wich form the basis of the emerging field of Regenerative Medicine. Penn students will reinforce their learning of these concepts by mentoring high school students, demonstrations by Penn scientists, and a co-teaching method involvimng Penn faculty and a partnering high school teacher. A primary goal of this course is to expose both Penn and high school students to cutting edge science and its societal impact. Through this course Penn students will learn critical skills that can help them bring scientific ideas to professionals, and important to any educated professional. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "STEM CELL SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS: HISTORY, ETHICS AND EDUCATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29115/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.60", "rTAQuality": "3.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.93", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "STEM CELL SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS: HISTORY, ETHICS AND EDUCATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-302-401", "path": "/courses/29115/sections/401", "id": "29115-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-302-401", "STSC-302-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/29115/sections/401/reviews/5592-JAMIE-R--SHUDA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5592-JAMIE-R--SHUDA", "first_name": "JAMIE R.", "last_name": "SHUDA", "id": "5592-JAMIE-R--SHUDA", "name": "JAMIE R.
