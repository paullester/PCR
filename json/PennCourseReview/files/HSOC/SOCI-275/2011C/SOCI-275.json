{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1057"}, "description": "This course will give the student an introduction to the sociological study of medicine. Medical sociology is a broad field, covering topics as diverse as the institution and profession of medicine, the practice of medical care, and the social factors that contribute to sickness and well-being. Although we will not explore everything, we will attempt to cover as much of the field as possible through four thematic units: (1) the organization and development of the profession of medicine, (2) the delivery of health-care, especially doctor-patient interaction, (3) the social and cultural factors that affect how illness is defined, and (4) the social causes of illness. The class will emphasize empirical research especially but not only quantitative research. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25124/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "1.98", "rStimulateInterest": "3.41", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.02", "rInstructorAccess": "3.51", "rReadingsValue": "2.85", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.62"}, "section": {"name": "MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-275-401", "path": "/courses/25124/sections/401", "id": "25124-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-275-401", "HSOC-275-401"]}, "comments": "Sociology 275 provides a foundation for the sociological study of medicine.

Almost everyone found it to be engaging. There are multiple midterms and a major paper, but students comment that the workload is not overwhelming by any stretch.\r\n\r\nStudents gush about Professor Schnittker. One person wrote that they \u201creally enjoyed medical sociology because of Professor Schnittker.\u201d Other reviewers describe him as \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201cexcellent,\u201d and \u201centhusiastic.\u201d Much is made of his extension of office hours and accessibility to students. He is also a good lecturer, according to most.\r\n\r\nThere were few complaints about the exams, with one student calling them \u201cvery fair, as long as you do the work.\u201d This class is for upperclassmen specifically. As mentioned above, the workload is manageable and the exams appropriately difficult.\r\n", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/25124/sections/401/reviews/1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER", "first_name": "JASON", "last_name": "SCHNITTKER", "id": "1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER", "name": "JASON SCHNITTKER"}, "num_reviewers": 68, "id": "25124-401-1105-JASON-SCHNITTKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-275", "path": "/courses/25124", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25124/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-275-401", "path": "/courses/25124/sections/401", "id": "25124-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-275-401", "HSOC-275-401"]}]}, "id": 25124, "aliases": ["SOCI-275", "HSOC-275"]}
