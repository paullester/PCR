{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1057"}, "description": "This course will give the student an introduction to the sociological study of medicine. Medical sociology is a broad field, covering topics as diverse as the institution and profession of medicine, the practice of medical care, and the social factors that contribute to sickness and well-being. Although we will not explore everything, we will attempt to cover as much of the field as possible through four thematic units: (1) the organization and development of the profession of medicine, (2) the delivery of health-care, especially doctor-patient interaction, (3) the social and cultural factors that affect how illness is defined, and (4) the social causes of illness. The class will emphasize empirical research especially but not only quantitative research. \n\n", "semester": "2005B", "name": "MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11338/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SOCI-275-900", "path": "/courses/11338/sections/900", "id": "11338-900", "aliases": ["SOCI-275-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/11338/sections/900/reviews/3488-COLETTE-JOYCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3488-COLETTE-JOYCE", "first_name": "COLETTE", "last_name": "JOYCE", "id": "3488-COLETTE-JOYCE", "name": "COLETTE JOYCE"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "11338-900-3488-COLETTE-JOYCE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-275", "path": "/courses/11338", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11338/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "SOCI-275-900", "path": "/courses/11338/sections/900", "id": "11338-900", "aliases": ["SOCI-275-900"]}]}, "id": 11338, "aliases": ["SOCI-275"]}
