{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4734"}, "description": "International \" development\" encompasses everything from growing rice to delivering babies to running currency markets. High-level public policy, seemingly remote from the day-to-day stuff of life and death, has a profound impact on the basic living conditions of a majority of the world's people. The aim in this course is to understand how development policy--for example, the outcome of World Trade Organization negotiations--affects the health of poor people. We look at how the practice of international development has been shaped, over the past sixty years and more, by political interests with no straightforward bearing on the kinds of health outcomes we might assume to be the aims of development. We relate current and emerging trends in development--microfinance, climate justice--to the history of policy agendas at the national and international level. By the course's end, students will have a critical, historically informed perspective on the practice of international development. \n\nEach student will develop an original research paper over the course of the term and have the chance to present research in progress to the group. This course fulfills the capstone requirement for the Health and Societies major. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "DEVELPMNT & GLOBAL HLTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18838/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.92", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "0.92", "rRecommendMajor": "1.85", "rCourseQuality": "1.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "1.85", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.46", "rCommAbility": "0.83", "rInstructorQuality": "1.46"}, "section": {"name": "DEVELPMNT & GLOBAL HLTH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-438-301", "path": "/courses/18838/sections/301", "id": "18838-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-438-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/18838/sections/301/reviews/5054-JOSHUA-BERSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5054-JOSHUA-BERSON", "first_name": "JOSHUA", "last_name": "BERSON", "id": "5054-JOSHUA-BERSON", "name": "JOSHUA BERSON"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "18838-301-5054-JOSHUA-BERSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-438", "path": "/courses/18838", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18838/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEVELPMNT & GLOBAL HLTH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "HSOC-438-301", "path": "/courses/18838/sections/301", "id": "18838-301", "aliases": ["HSOC-438-301"]}]}, "id": 18838, "aliases": ["HSOC-438"]}
