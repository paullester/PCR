{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1515"}, "description": "First the course will develop a persepctive for viewing social problems drawn largely on my own work as well as that of Gusfelds and Edelman. Next we will explore the domains to which a Physician's expertise is limited using Weber, Rosenberg and others. We will then develop a perspective from anthropological and sociological literature on the courts as public arenas for articulating Durkheimian collective conscience. All of this theory building is in the first half of the seminar. The second half of the course will involve an intensive case study of a few dilemmas which have wended their way through the courts. I intend to look at \"Baby Doe Regulations\" and the Intensive Care Nursery; the problem of the cessation of life-supporting treatment; the legitimacy of mass screening - be it for genetic defects or substance abuse; and the propriety of surrogate motherhood. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "LAW,MED & PUB POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2240/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.15", "rRecommendMajor": "2.98", "rCourseQuality": "2.39", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.49", "rReadingsValue": "2.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.02", "rCommAbility": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "2.87"}, "section": {"name": "LAW,MED & PUB POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-273-401", "path": "/courses/2240/sections/401", "id": "2240-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-273-401", "HSOC-273-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 74, "path": "/courses/2240/sections/401/reviews/1712-CHARLES-L--BOSK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1712-CHARLES-L--BOSK", "first_name": "CHARLES L.", "last_name": "BOSK", "id": "1712-CHARLES-L--BOSK", "name": "CHARLES L.
