{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/860"}, "description": "This course introduces basic concepts of operations management and application of the same in business practice today. We will examine the theoretical foundations of operations management and how these principles or models can be employed in both tactical and strategic decision making. Topics covered in detail are forecasting techniques, planning under deterministic and uncertain demand, operations planning and scheduling, queuing theory, service operations management, newsvendor models, risk pooling strategies in firms, capacity and revenue management, and supply chain coordination. We will conclude by discussing how supply chains evolve under technological change. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO OM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27957/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.87", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.74", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.30", "rCommAbility": "3.48", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO OM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-220-001", "path": "/courses/27957/sections/001", "id": "27957-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-220-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/27957/sections/001/reviews/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "first_name": "SENTHIL", "last_name": "VEERARAGHAVAN", "id": "3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "name": "SENTHIL VEERARAGHAVAN"}, "num_reviewers": 31, "id": "27957-001-3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO OM", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-220-002", "path": "/courses/27957/sections/002", "id": "27957-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-220-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/27957/sections/002/reviews/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "first_name": "SENTHIL", "last_name": "VEERARAGHAVAN", "id": "3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "name": "SENTHIL VEERARAGHAVAN"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "27957-002-3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-220", "path": "/courses/27957", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27957/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRODUCTION TO OM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-220-001", "path": "/courses/27957/sections/001", "id": "27957-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-220-001"]}, {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO OM", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-220-002", "path": "/courses/27957/sections/002", "id": "27957-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-220-002"]}]}, "id": 27957, "aliases": ["OPIM-220"]}
