{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2056"}, "description": "At its surface this course introduces students to the management and technical issues associated with planning and designing large-scale computer systems. It does so in part as an elaboration of Fred Brooks's observation that \"The technology, the surrounding organization, and the traditions of the craft conspire to define certain items of paperwork.\" But if that were our only goal, we would soon find ourselves mired in (and probably arguing about) the minutiae of how such paper items ought to be constructed - not a very helpful pedagogical exercise. So then, at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures, and why in spite of it, systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views, differences in experience and training, and over long periods of time. More than anything else, within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design, this course treats communication, corroboration, and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SYSTEMS ANAL,DESIGN,IMPL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3349/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "SYSTEMS ANAL,DESIGN,IMPL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-316-401", "path": "/courses/3349/sections/401", "id": "3349-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-316-401", "OPIM-661-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/3349/sections/401/reviews/930-JAMES-L-CARPENTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/930-JAMES-L-CARPENTER", "first_name": "JAMES L", "last_name": "CARPENTER", "id": "930-JAMES-L-CARPENTER", "name": "JAMES L CARPENTER"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "3349-401-930-JAMES-L-CARPENTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-316", "path": "/courses/3349", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3349/sections", "values": [{"name": "SYSTEMS ANAL,DESIGN,IMPL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-316-401", "path": "/courses/3349/sections/401", "id": "3349-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-316-401", "OPIM-661-401"]}]}, "id": 3349, "aliases": ["OPIM-316", "OPIM-661"]}
