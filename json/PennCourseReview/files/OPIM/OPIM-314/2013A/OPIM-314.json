{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2055"}, "description": "Conducting business in a networked economy invariably involves interplay with technology. The purpose of this course is to improve understanding of technology (what it can or cannot enable) and the business drivers of technology-related decisions in firms. We will be discussing some of the new and most disruptive technologies right now to stimulate thought on new applications for commerce and new ventures, as well as their implications to the tech industry as a whole. Topics include social media, online advertising, big data, and cloud computing. \n\nThe course will take a layered approach (from network infrastructure) to data infrastructure to applications infrastructure, or direct enablers of commerce) to first, understanding and then, thinking about technology enablers. Network infrastructure layers include fundamentals of wired and wireless infrastructure technologies such as protocols for networking, broadband technologies - for last (DSL, Cable etc) and other miles (advances in optical networking) and digital cellular communications. Data infrastructure layers include usage tracking technologies, search technologies and data mining. Direct application layers include personalization technologies (CRM), design technologies for content and exchanges, software renting enablers, application service provision, agents and security mechanisms. Finally some emberging technology enablers (such as bluetooth, biometrics and virtual reality) are identified and discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30821/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.97", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rTAQuality": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.37", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.34", "rInstructorAccess": "2.51", "rReadingsValue": "2.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.97", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-314-001", "path": "/courses/30821/sections/001", "id": "30821-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-314-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/30821/sections/001/reviews/2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR", "first_name": "KARTIK", "last_name": "HOSANAGAR", "id": "2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR", "name": "KARTIK HOSANAGAR"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "30821-001-2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-314", "path": "/courses/30821", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30821/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-314-001", "path": "/courses/30821/sections/001", "id": "30821-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-314-001"]}]}, "id": 30821, "aliases": ["OPIM-314"]}
