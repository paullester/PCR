{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2055"}, "description": "This course is about understanding emerging technology enablers with a goal of stimulating thinking on new applications for commerce. No prerequisite or technical background is assumed. The class is self-contained (mainly lecture-based) and will culminate in a class-driven identification of novel businesses that exploit these enablers. \n\nThe course will take a layered approach (from network infrastructure) to data infrastructure to applications infrastructure, or direct enablers of commerce) to first, understanding and then, thinking about technology enablers. Network infrastructure layers include fundamentals of wired and wireless infrastructure technologies such as protocols for networking, broadband technologies - for last (DSL, Cable etc) and other miles (advances in optical networking) and digital cellular communications. Data infrastructure layers include usage tracking technologies, search technologies and data mining. Direct application layers include personalization technologies (CRM), design technologies for content and exchanges, software renting enablers, application service provision, agents and security mechanisms. Finally some emberging technology enablers (such as bluetooth, biometrics and virtual reality) are identified and discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26571/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.26", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.32", "rInstructorAccess": "3.74", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.32", "rCommAbility": "3.81", "rInstructorQuality": "3.81"}, "section": {"name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-314-401", "path": "/courses/26571/sections/401", "id": "26571-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-314-401", "OPIM-662-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/26571/sections/401/reviews/2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR", "first_name": "KARTIK", "last_name": "HOSANAGAR", "id": "2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR", "name": "KARTIK HOSANAGAR"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "26571-401-2811-KARTIK-HOSANAGAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-314", "path": "/courses/26571", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26571/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-314-401", "path": "/courses/26571/sections/401", "id": "26571-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-314-401", "OPIM-662-401"]}]}, "id": 26571, "aliases": ["OPIM-314", "OPIM-662"]}
