{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2055"}, "description": "Conducting business in a networked economy invariably involves interplay with technology. The purpose of this course is to improve understanding of technology (what it can or cannot enable) and the business drivers of technology-related decisions in firms. We will be discussing some of the new and most disruptive technologies right now to stimulate thought on new applications for commerce and new ventures, as well as their implications to the tech industry as a whole. Topics include social media, online advertising, big data, and cloud computing. \n\nThe course will take a layered approach (from network infrastructure) to data infrastructure to applications infrastructure, or direct enablers of commerce) to first, understanding and then, thinking about technology enablers. Network infrastructure layers include fundamentals of wired and wireless infrastructure technologies such as protocols for networking, broadband technologies - for last (DSL, Cable etc) and other miles (advances in optical networking) and digital cellular communications. Data infrastructure layers include usage tracking technologies, search technologies and data mining. Direct application layers include personalization technologies (CRM), design technologies for content and exchanges, software renting enablers, application service provision, agents and security mechanisms. Finally some emberging technology enablers (such as bluetooth, biometrics and virtual reality) are identified and discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27963/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.61", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.86", "rWorkRequired": "1.72", "rInstructorAccess": "2.65", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "2.06", "rInstructorQuality": "2.48"}, "section": {"name": "ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-314-001", "path": "/courses/27963/sections/001", "id": "27963-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-314-001"]}, "comments": "Enabling Technologies focuses on understanding emerging technology enablers with a goal of stimulating thinking on new applications for commerce. OPIM 314 is mainly lecture-based and culminates in a class-driven identification of novel businesses that exploit enablers. The course covers network, data, and application infrastructure, and technology enablers. Network infrastructure includes fundamentals of wired and wireless infrastructure technologies such as protocols for networking, broadband technologies, and other miles and digital cellular communications. Data infrastructure includes usage tracking technologies, search technologies and data mining. Direct application includes personalization technologies, design technologies for content and exchanges, software renting enablers, application service provision, agents, and security mechanisms.

Overall, students said they learned a lot about \u201cthe up and coming technologies in the world.\u201d Additionally, students commented that the guest speakers were \u201caccomplished\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Wu as \u201ctalented,\u201d \u201chumorous,\u201d and \u201cfriendly,\u201d as well as knowledgeable about tech. One student said that Professor Wu did \u201can outstanding job explaining the concepts related to emerging technologies and the technical explanations of existing systems.\u201d Additionally, students reported that Professor Wu was helpful during office hours in answering questions related to course material and industry practices, as well as willing to discuss grading. However, a few students commented that Professor Wu could have been more organized. They noted that \u201creadings were sometimes added last minute and were hard to access\u201d and that assignments would often \u201ccome back without any comments.\u201d Nevertheless, students appreciated Professor Wu\u2019s passion for the subject and teaching ability.\r\n\r\n\tOPIM 314 comes recommended for those interested in a career in entrepreneurship, start-ups, or technology. Students commented that the course assignments were \u201cfairly graded\u201d and \u201casked relevant questions relating to readings.\u201d However, one student reported that participation counted for 30 percent of the grade, and found it difficult to participate without a technological background. There is no prerequisite or technical background required for this course.\r\n", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/27963/sections/001/reviews/6161-LYNN-L--WU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6161-LYNN-L--WU", "first_name": "LYNN L.", "last_name": "WU", "id": "6161-LYNN-L--WU", "name": "LYNN L.
