{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5144"}, "description": "Several forces, ranging from technology that has dramatically reduced the cost of communication, to political developments such as the opening up of China, Vietnam, and Eastern Europe, have created an avalanche of outsourcing and offshoring and lead to supply chains that stretch halfway around the world. This course will study the many questions that arise in the management of such global supply chains, including: Which design and production activities to do in-house and which to outsource? Where to locate various activities around the world? How to forecast the many factors that influence these decisions, including inflation in cost factors such as labor and freight, and the likelihood of future government regulation or political instability? How to keep the supply chain flexible so as to adapt to change? How to manage a geographically disbursed supply chain, including what relationships to have with vendors to ensure low cost, high quality, flexibility, safety, humane labor practices and respect for sustainability of the environment? The course is highly interactive, using case discussions in most classes and senior supply chain executives in many sessions. Grades are based one-third each on class participation, indivudla write-ups of the discussion questions for 3 of the class sessions, and a course paper. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29473/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.61", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.58", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.97", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-673-001", "path": "/courses/29473/sections/001", "id": "29473-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-673-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/29473/sections/001/reviews/4955-MARSHALL-L--FISHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4955-MARSHALL-L--FISHER", "first_name": "MARSHALL L.", "last_name": "FISHER", "id": "4955-MARSHALL-L--FISHER", "name": "MARSHALL L.
