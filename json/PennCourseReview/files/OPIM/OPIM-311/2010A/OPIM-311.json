{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/862"}, "description": "This course is taught with the more descriptive title of \"Scripting for Business Analytics.\" \"Business Analytics\" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing, including simple equational models, constrained optimization models, probabilistic models, visualization, data analysis, and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs, but \"industrial strength\" applications typically use more sophisticated tools, based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes, rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering), as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful, but not required or presumed for this course. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "BUSINESS COMP LANGUAGES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26570/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.35", "rDifficulty": "2.49", "rStimulateInterest": "2.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.51", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "2.90"}, "section": {"name": "BUSINESS COMP LANGUAGES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-311-001", "path": "/courses/26570/sections/001", "id": "26570-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-311-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/26570/sections/001/reviews/931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "first_name": "STEVEN O", "last_name": "KIMBROUGH", "id": "931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "name": "STEVEN O KIMBROUGH"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "26570-001-931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-311", "path": "/courses/26570", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26570/sections", "values": [{"name": "BUSINESS COMP LANGUAGES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-311-001", "path": "/courses/26570/sections/001", "id": "26570-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-311-001"]}]}, "id": 26570, "aliases": ["OPIM-311"]}
