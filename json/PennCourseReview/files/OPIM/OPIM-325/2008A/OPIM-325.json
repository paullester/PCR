{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2371"}, "description": "This course focuses on agent-based computational models in the social sciences, especially in economic, in commercial and in strategic (game-theoretic) contexts. This relatively recent and now rapidly-developing form of computer simulation seeks to explain and predict complex social phenomena \"from the ground up\", through interactions of comparatively simple agents. The course reviews experimental and theoretical results, and exposes the students to modern development environments for this form of simulation. Students have the opportunity to design and implement agent-based simulations. Programming, however, is not required. This course aims to integrate various topics in agent-based simulation, while developing an appreciation of the problems that are particularly characteristic of this form of simulation so that students will understand its promise and potential. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "COMP SIMULATION MODELS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20652/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.22", "rStimulateInterest": "2.94", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "3.72", "rReadingsValue": "2.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "COMP SIMULATION MODELS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-325-001", "path": "/courses/20652/sections/001", "id": "20652-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-325-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/20652/sections/001/reviews/931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "first_name": "STEVEN O", "last_name": "KIMBROUGH", "id": "931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "name": "STEVEN O KIMBROUGH"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "20652-001-931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-325", "path": "/courses/20652", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20652/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP SIMULATION MODELS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-325-001", "path": "/courses/20652/sections/001", "id": "20652-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-325-001"]}]}, "id": 20652, "aliases": ["OPIM-325"]}
