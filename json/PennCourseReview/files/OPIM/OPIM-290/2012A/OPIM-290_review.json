Perspectives covered include cognitive psychology of human problem-solving, judgment and choice, theories of rational judgment and decision, and the mathematical theory of games. Much of the material is technically rigorous. \r\n\r\nStudents said the class was \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cmeaningful.\u201d They really enjoyed this class as it made think about the decision-making of humans in different terms. Students commented that the structure of the class were slide presentations and then a discussion, unless it was an activity day. Students responded positively to the activity days.\r\n\t\r\nStudents said Professor Milkman was \u201cgenerally great\u201d, however many described Professor Milkman as \u201ccondescending\u201d and \u201cunwilling to hear other opinions.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome commented that Professor Milkman was a tough grader as it was really hard to get an A. Students who really enjoy reading Gladwell and Freakonomics are highly recommended to take this class.  Prior or current enrollment in STAT 101 or the equivalent, although not required, is strongly recommended.\r\n", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/27959/sections/001/reviews/5504-KATHERINE-L--MILKMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5504-KATHERINE-L--MILKMAN", "first_name": "KATHERINE L.", "last_name": "MILKMAN", "id": "5504-KATHERINE-L--MILKMAN", "name": "KATHERINE L.
