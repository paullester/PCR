{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5715"}, "description": "Operations strategy is about organizing people and resources to gain a competitive advantage in the delivery of products (both goods and services) to customers. This course approaches this challenge primarily from two perspectives: 1) how should a firm design their products so that they can be profitably offered; 2) how can a firm best organize and acquire resources to deliver its portfolio of products to customers. To be able to make intelligent decisions regarding these high-level choices, this course also provides a foundation of analytical methods. These methods give students a conceptual framekwork for understanding the linkage between how a firm manages its supply and how well that supply matches the firm's resulting demand. Specific course topics include designing service systems, managing inventory and product variety, capacity planning, approaches to sourcing and supplier management, constructing global supply chains, managing sustainability initiatives, and revenue management. This course emphasizes both quantitative tools and qualitative frameworks. Neither is more important than the other. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "OPERATIONS STRATEGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30830/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rTAQuality": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.48", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.23", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.74"}, "section": {"name": "OPERATIONS STRATEGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-615-001", "path": "/courses/30830/sections/001", "id": "30830-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-615-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/30830/sections/001/reviews/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "first_name": "SENTHIL", "last_name": "VEERARAGHAVAN", "id": "3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "name": "SENTHIL VEERARAGHAVAN"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "30830-001-3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rTAQuality": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.84", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "OPERATIONS STRATEGY", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-615-002", "path": "/courses/30830/sections/002", "id": "30830-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-615-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/30830/sections/002/reviews/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "first_name": "SENTHIL", "last_name": "VEERARAGHAVAN", "id": "3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN", "name": "SENTHIL VEERARAGHAVAN"}, "num_reviewers": 48, "id": "30830-002-3141-SENTHIL-VEERARAGHAVAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-615", "path": "/courses/30830", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30830/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPERATIONS STRATEGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-615-001", "path": "/courses/30830/sections/001", "id": "30830-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-615-001"]}, {"name": "OPERATIONS STRATEGY", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-615-002", "path": "/courses/30830/sections/002", "id": "30830-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-615-002"]}]}, "id": 30830, "aliases": ["OPIM-615"]}
