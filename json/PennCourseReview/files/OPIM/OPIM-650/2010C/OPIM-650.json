{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4638"}, "description": "Operational performance has long been emphasized as a key driver of firm value in the basic materials industries (e.g., steel or paper) as well as in mature and highly competitive manufacturing industries (e.g., automotive or personal computers). In contrast, industries such as financial services, healthcare, or pharmaceuticals have enjoyed sufficiently high margins that operational performance only recently began receiving significant managerial attention. Given its emergence as a relatively new topic in these industries, managers and consultants often struggle with questions such as \"What performance measures should we track?\", \"How do operational performance measures impact the bottom line performance?\", or \"How do we go about improving processes to achieve various operational performance improvements, including cost savings, lead-time reduction, or increases in product variety?\" Even in more mature industries, managers often struggle to correctly prioritize operational improvement initiatives and to link them directly to financial performance. \n\nThe objective of the course is to provide students with a set of tools that supports them in analyzing the operational performance of a company and to guide them in increasing the overall value of the firm by improving its operations. Specifically, we will discuss how to: 1. Develop an integrated model linking operational performance measures to financial value; 2. Analyze indicators of opportunities for operational improvement; 3. Identify levers (techniques) to improve operational performance; 4. Value potential operational improvements, both individually as well as collectively. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "OPS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23598/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.79", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rRecommendMajor": "2.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.07", "rWorkRequired": "1.96", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.08", "rCommAbility": "2.14", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "OPS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-650-001", "path": "/courses/23598/sections/001", "id": "23598-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-650-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/23598/sections/001/reviews/4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI", "first_name": "RICHARD KUM-YEW", "last_name": "LAI", "id": "4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI", "name": "RICHARD KUM-YEW LAI"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "23598-001-4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.72", "rDifficulty": "1.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.34", "rRecommendMajor": "2.24", "rCourseQuality": "1.85", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.34", "rReadingsValue": "2.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "2.45", "rInstructorQuality": "2.64"}, "section": {"name": "OPS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-650-002", "path": "/courses/23598/sections/002", "id": "23598-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-650-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/23598/sections/002/reviews/4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI", "first_name": "RICHARD KUM-YEW", "last_name": "LAI", "id": "4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI", "name": "RICHARD KUM-YEW LAI"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "23598-002-4953-RICHARD-KUM-YEW-LAI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-650", "path": "/courses/23598", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23598/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-650-001", "path": "/courses/23598/sections/001", "id": "23598-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-650-001"]}, {"name": "OPS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-650-002", "path": "/courses/23598/sections/002", "id": "23598-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-650-002"]}]}, "id": 23598, "aliases": ["OPIM-650"]}
