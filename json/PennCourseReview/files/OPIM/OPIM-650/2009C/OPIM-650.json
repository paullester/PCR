{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4638"}, "description": "Operational performance has long been emphasized as a key driver of firm value in the basic materials industries (e.g., steel or paper) as well as in mature and highly competitive manufacturing industries (e.g., automotive or personal computers). In contrast, industries such as financial services, healthcare, or pharmaceuticals have enjoyed sufficiently high margins that operational performance only recently began receiving significant managerial attention. Given its emergence as a relatively new topic in these industries, managers and consultants often struggle with questions such as \"What performance measures should we track?\", \"How do operational performance measures impact the bottom line performance?\", or \"How do we go about improving processes to achieve various operational performance improvements, including cost savings, lead-time reduction, or increases in product variety?\" Even in more mature industries, managers often struggle to correctly prioritize operational improvement initiatives and to link them directly to financial performance. \n\nThe objective of the course is to provide students with a set of tools that supports them in analyzing the operational performance of a company and to guide them in increasing the overall value of the firm by improving its operations. Specifically, we will discuss how to: 1. Develop an integrated model linking operational performance measures to financial value; 2. Analyze indicators of opportunities for operational improvement; 3. Identify levers (techniques) to improve operational performance; 4. Value potential operational improvements, both individually as well as collectively. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "OPERATIONS PERFORM ANAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17875/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.19", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.19", "rRecommendMajor": "2.74", "rCourseQuality": "2.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "2.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.30", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "OPERATIONS PERFORM ANAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-650-001", "path": "/courses/17875/sections/001", "id": "17875-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-650-001"]}, "comments": "The objective of OPIM 650 is to provide students with a set of tools that supports them in analyzing the operational performance of a company and to guide them in increasing the overall value of the firm by improving its operations. \r\nStudents thought that while the course was \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201cit has a lot more potential.\u201d Specifically, students would have liked a bigger focus on \u201coperational and financial due diligence\u201d as well as \u201cmore concrete techniques to take away.\u201d Many wished the class followed a prospective takeover analysis from start to finish.
