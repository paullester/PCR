It emphasizes the trends in corporate practices and uses case studies to examine the interactions between the environment and the firm. Value creation focuses on new innovative services and financial products in this fast growing sphere. This course has three objectives: to increase your knowledge as future top decision makers on key environmental questions; to recognize environmental concerns as competitive opportunities; to teach students to think strategically and act entrepreneurially on environmental issues.
