{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5011"}, "description": "The course provides the student with a number of tools and concepts necessary for creating and managing product development processes.The course consists of two interwoven parts. First, it presents the basic steps that are necessary for moving from a \"cool idea\" to a product sufficiently mature to launch an entrepreneurial start-up. This includes cases, lectures, and exercises on topics like identifying customer needs, developing a product concept as well as effective prototyping strategies. The capstone of this first part is a real project in which student teams conceptualize and develop a new product or service up to the completion of a fully functional prototype. \n\nSecond, the course discusses a number of challenges related to product development as encountered by management consultants, members of cross-functional development teams as well as general managers. We will analyze several cases related to, among others, resource allocation in R&D organizations, organizational forms of product development teams, as well as managing development projects across large geographic distances. \n\n", "semester": "2011B", "name": "PRODUCT DESIGN&DEVEL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25480/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rRecommendMajor": "2.96", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39", "rReadingsValue": "2.87", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.74", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "PRODUCT DESIGN&DEVEL", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "OPIM-654-751", "path": "/courses/25480/sections/751", "id": "25480-751", "aliases": ["OPIM-654-751"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/25480/sections/751/reviews/1924-KARL-T--ULRICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1924-KARL-T--ULRICH", "first_name": "KARL T.", "last_name": "ULRICH", "id": "1924-KARL-T--ULRICH", "name": "KARL T.
