The key topics covered include capacity management, service operations, inventory control, structured decision making, constrained optimization and simulation. This course teaches how to model complex business situations and how to master tools to improve business performance. The goal is to provide a set of foundational skills useful for future coursework atWharton as well as providing an overview of problems and techniques that characterize disciplines that comprise Operations and Information Management. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4530/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "1.08", "rRecommendMajor": "2.42", "rCourseQuality": "1.65", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.13", "rReadingsValue": "1.52", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.79", "rCommAbility": "1.38", "rInstructorQuality": "1.79"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-101-002", "path": "/courses/4530/sections/002", "id": "4530-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-101-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/4530/sections/002/reviews/2297-JACOB-ZAHAVI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2297-JACOB-ZAHAVI", "first_name": "JACOB", "last_name": "ZAHAVI", "id": "2297-JACOB-ZAHAVI", "name": "JACOB ZAHAVI"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "4530-002-2297-JACOB-ZAHAVI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-101", "path": "/courses/4530", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4530/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-101-002", "path": "/courses/4530/sections/002", "id": "4530-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-101-002"]}]}, "id": 4530, "aliases": ["OPIM-101"]}
