One student thought that it was one of the \u201cmost relevant classes at Penn.\u201d The course is divided into two separate parts, with separate teachers as well. Students found that there was \u201cgreat coordination of homework, recitation, and exams\u201d making the course very efficiently run. However, some students remarked that the lectures were too boring or simplistic. In addition, one student noted that the large course size made it difficult to learn. Another student did not like the relationship between the two parts of the course, deeming it \u201cinconsistent.\u201d \r\n\t\r\nStudents all agreed that Savin was a great professor. He is \u201cboth good at explaining concepts\u201d and \u201cable to demonstrate real life applicability.\u201d One student noted that Savin is particularly funny. However, one student noted that the professor \u201cshould share more personal experience\u201d and that he sometimes \u201crushed through topics.\u201d \r\n\t\r\nMost students explained that this course is difficult due to the tight curves of the midterms. One student explained that there is \u201cno partial credit on tests.\u201d One student also noted that it is very \u201cimportant to keep pace with the work in order to develop skills.\u201d The majority of students thought the first half was a lot harder than the second. This course is offered both semesters and has no prerequisites.
