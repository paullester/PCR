The course is intended to build a solid foundation and develop comfort in using the computer to solve problems, teach management software tools for course work and professional life, and provide an understanding of the role of computers in modern organizations. Topics include budgeting, analytical modeling, sensitivity analysis, database management, decision analysis, optimization, neural networks, and simulation. The new course format incorporates all previous recitation material into lectures. The recitation or lab section has been replaced with an open laboratory policy that allows students to complete labs at their convenience.
