{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/857"}, "description": "OPIM 101 explores a variety of common quantitative modeling problems that arise frequently in business settings, and discusses how they can be formally modeled and solved with a combination of business insight and computer-based tools. The key topics covered include capacity management, service operations, inventory control, structured decision making, constrained optimization and simulation. This course teaches how to model complex business situations and how to master tools to improve business performance. The goal is to provide a set of foundational skills useful for future coursework atWharton as well as providing an overview of problems and techniques that characterize disciplines that comprise Operations and Information Management. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3341/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.10", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.35", "rWorkRequired": "3.45", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "1.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.74", "rCommAbility": "2.10", "rInstructorQuality": "2.35"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-101-001", "path": "/courses/3341/sections/001", "id": "3341-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-101-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/3341/sections/001/reviews/1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "BUZYDLOWSKI", "id": "1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI", "name": "JAN BUZYDLOWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "3341-001-1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.32", "rDifficulty": "3.16", "rStimulateInterest": "1.66", "rRecommendMajor": "2.41", "rCourseQuality": "1.84", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.61", "rReadingsValue": "1.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.24", "rCommAbility": "2.16", "rInstructorQuality": "2.41"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-101-002", "path": "/courses/3341/sections/002", "id": "3341-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-101-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 73, "path": "/courses/3341/sections/002/reviews/1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "BUZYDLOWSKI", "id": "1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI", "name": "JAN BUZYDLOWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "3341-002-1656-JAN-BUZYDLOWSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-101", "path": "/courses/3341", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3341/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-101-001", "path": "/courses/3341/sections/001", "id": "3341-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-101-001"]}, {"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTER", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "OPIM-101-002", "path": "/courses/3341/sections/002", "id": "3341-002", "aliases": ["OPIM-101-002"]}]}, "id": 3341, "aliases": ["OPIM-101"]}
