{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5010"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the construction of data analysis tools that are commonly used for business applications, especially in consulting and finance. The course builds on the spreadsheet and analytical skills developed in OPIM101, providing a much more extensive treatment of spreadsheet application development and database management. The first portion of the course will focus on programming in VBA, the embedded programming language in the Microsoft Office suite of applications. This will be supplemented with discussion of industry best practice in software development, such as specification development, interface design, documentation, and testing. The second portion of the class will emphasize data access and analysis utilizing SQL, the industry standard language for interacting with database software. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "DEV TOOLS FOR DATA ANLYS: DEVELOPING TOOLS FOR DATA ACCESS AND ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22235/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.74", "rDifficulty": "3.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.37", "rRecommendMajor": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.74", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "DEV TOOLS FOR DATA ANLYS: DEVELOPING TOOLS FOR DATA ACCESS AND ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-105-001", "path": "/courses/22235/sections/001", "id": "22235-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-105-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/22235/sections/001/reviews/938-LORIN-M--HITT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/938-LORIN-M--HITT", "first_name": "LORIN M.", "last_name": "HITT", "id": "938-LORIN-M--HITT", "name": "LORIN M.
