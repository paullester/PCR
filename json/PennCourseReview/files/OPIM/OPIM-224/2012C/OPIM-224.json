{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4637"}, "description": "OPIM 224 deals with the production and delivery of services. Services typicallyare intangible, not storable, not transportable and highly variable. Their delivery involves significant customer contact through distributed processes and thus present particular operational challenges. OPIM 224 introduces analytical frameworks, management tools and strategic perspectives appropriate for the management of service operations. Students will also have the opportunity to apply the material covered in the course to a particular service industry by conducting an application group project in the second half of the semester. Projects are performed under the close supervision of the instructor and will involve analysis of a particular service process and field work. For more details, as well as questions, please feel free to contact Professor Morris Cohen: cohen@wharton.upenn.edu. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SERVICE OP:MDLS&APPL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29464/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "SERVICE OP:MDLS&APPL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-224-001", "path": "/courses/29464/sections/001", "id": "29464-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-224-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/29464/sections/001/reviews/4951-MORRIS-A-COHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4951-MORRIS-A-COHEN", "first_name": "MORRIS A", "last_name": "COHEN", "id": "4951-MORRIS-A-COHEN", "name": "MORRIS A COHEN"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "29464-001-4951-MORRIS-A-COHEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-224", "path": "/courses/29464", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29464/sections", "values": [{"name": "SERVICE OP:MDLS&APPL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "OPIM-224-001", "path": "/courses/29464/sections/001", "id": "29464-001", "aliases": ["OPIM-224-001"]}]}, "id": 29464, "aliases": ["OPIM-224"]}
