{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1312"}, "description": "Among the many dramatic transformations that have marked French culture and society since World War II, the emergence of la jeunesse will be our reference point to examine the major trends of the period. By means of films, short novel and a basic historical text, we will consider the shifts in lifestyle, values, and identity among youth at critical moments in the history of the last 50 years. Conducted entirely in French, this course requires the student to view 7 films outside of class, 1 written mid-term in class, reaction paragraphs for each film, 3 of which will be expanded to relate the films to the required readings of Francois Sagan, Georges Perec and Rachid Djaidani. Students will also present to the class their research upon some aspect of youth culture or identity of their choice. The written part of that presentation will be integrated into the final exam paper. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "MODERN FRANCE: YOUTH CULTURE SINCE 1968", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15802/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.92", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "MODERN FRANCE: YOUTH CULTURE SINCE 1968", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-223-301", "path": "/courses/15802/sections/301", "id": "15802-301", "aliases": ["FREN-223-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/15802/sections/301/reviews/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "first_name": "MICHELE H.", "last_name": "RICHMAN", "id": "551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "name": "MICHELE H.
