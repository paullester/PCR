Relations between France, Europe, and NATO (Eurocentrism vs. Atlantism); The cultural and social European Model and its future vs. American liberalism (the unemployment problem); Is there a European citizen? (education and training); Europe and its relations with the rest of the world (Euro vs. dollar and yen). After a video presentation of each topic, two students will lead the discussion. The rest of the students will contribute to the debate by preparing question and comments. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20227/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.46", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-301", "path": "/courses/20227/sections/301", "id": "20227-301", "aliases": ["FREN-322-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/20227/sections/301/reviews/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "first_name": "BETTY J", "last_name": "SLOWINSKI", "id": "550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "name": "BETTY J SLOWINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "20227-301-550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.81"}, "section": {"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-302", "path": "/courses/20227/sections/302", "id": "20227-302", "aliases": ["FREN-322-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/20227/sections/302/reviews/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "first_name": "BETTY J", "last_name": "SLOWINSKI", "id": "550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "name": "BETTY J SLOWINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "20227-302-550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FREN-322", "path": "/courses/20227", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20227/sections", "values": [{"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-301", "path": "/courses/20227/sections/301", "id": "20227-301", "aliases": ["FREN-322-301"]}, {"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-302", "path": "/courses/20227/sections/302", "id": "20227-302", "aliases": ["FREN-322-302"]}]}, "id": 20227, "aliases": ["FREN-322"]}
