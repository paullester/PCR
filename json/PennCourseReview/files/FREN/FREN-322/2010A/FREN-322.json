Relations between France, Europe, and NATO (Eurocentrism vs. Atlantism); The cultural and social European Model and its future vs. American liberalism (the unemployment problem); Is there a European citizen? (education and training); Europe and its relations with the rest of the world (Euro vs. dollar and yen). After a video presentation of each topic, two students will lead the discussion. The rest of the students will contribute to the debate by preparing question and comments. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26101/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-301", "path": "/courses/26101/sections/301", "id": "26101-301", "aliases": ["FREN-322-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/26101/sections/301/reviews/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "first_name": "BETTY J", "last_name": "SLOWINSKI", "id": "550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "name": "BETTY J SLOWINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "26101-301-550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "2.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.53"}, "section": {"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-302", "path": "/courses/26101/sections/302", "id": "26101-302", "aliases": ["FREN-322-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/26101/sections/302/reviews/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "first_name": "BETTY J", "last_name": "SLOWINSKI", "id": "550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "name": "BETTY J SLOWINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "26101-302-550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FREN-322", "path": "/courses/26101", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26101/sections", "values": [{"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-301", "path": "/courses/26101/sections/301", "id": "26101-301", "aliases": ["FREN-322-301"]}, {"name": "FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "FREN-322-302", "path": "/courses/26101/sections/302", "id": "26101-302", "aliases": ["FREN-322-302"]}]}, "id": 26101, "aliases": ["FREN-322"]}
