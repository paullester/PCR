{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/497"}, "description": "For students who have never studied French or who have had very little exposure to the language. Most students with previous French should be in French 121 (elementary French for \"false beginners\"). All students who have already studied French elsewhere are required to take the placement test.
