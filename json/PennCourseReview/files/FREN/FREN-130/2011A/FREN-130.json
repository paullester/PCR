Class is conducted entirely in French.\r\n\r\nStudents enrolled in the French 130 303 section had good things to say about both the course and Professor Ranalli. One stated that he/she \u201ccould not have asked for a better experience,\u201d and another commented that this was the best French class he/she had taken. Class was considered \u201cfun and interesting\u201d and the experience taught students \u201cuseful expressions and information that would help [them] in real French settings.\u201d Though one student felt that group work was sometimes cut off by the professor\u2019s interjections, on the whole, and that the students themselves were sometimes unresponsive to questions, students had a sound experience in the course. \r\n\r\nProfessor Ranalli was considered a \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cmasterful\u201d French instructor. Students commended her for encouraging them to process information in French rather than fall into the habit of merely translating internally. They felt she was very willing to help students and encouraged them to participate through rewarding effort. As one put it, \u201cshe is an exceptional teacher and anyone is lucky to have her.\u201d \r\n\r\nClass work included three chapter tests, weekly quizzes, and oral-based midterm and final exams. Additionally, students were expected to participate in class by means of frequent communicative activities such as role-plays, problem-solving tasks, discussions, and debates, often carried out in pairs or small groups.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/21753/sections/303/reviews/2982-TINA-MARIE-RANALLI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2982-TINA-MARIE-RANALLI", "first_name": "TINA-MARIE", "last_name": "RANALLI", "id": "2982-TINA-MARIE-RANALLI", "name": "TINA-MARIE RANALLI"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "21753-303-2982-TINA-MARIE-RANALLI"}, {"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.92", "rTAQuality": "3.63", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.54", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.62", "rReadingsValue": "2.85", "rInstructorConcern": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rClassPace": "2.15", "rExamsConsistent": "3.62", "rInstructorAccess": "3.92", "rGradeFairness": "3.77", "rArticulateGoals": "3.77", "rOralSkills": "3.92", "rNativeAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "3.92", "rInstructorEffective": "4.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE FRENCH I", "sectionnum": "304", "primary_alias": "FREN-130-304", "path": "/courses/21753/sections/304", "id": "21753-304", "aliases": ["FREN-130-304"]}, "comments": "French 130 is the first half of a two-semester intermediate sequence designed to help students attain a level of proficiency that should allow them to function comfortably in a French-speaking environment.
