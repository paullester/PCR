On completion of the course, students will also have the opportunity to take the Diplome de Francais Professionnel-DFP Affaires (C1) administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10458/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.58", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.92"}, "section": {"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/10458/sections/301", "id": "10458-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/10458/sections/301/reviews/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "first_name": "BETTY J", "last_name": "SLOWINSKI", "id": "550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "name": "BETTY J SLOWINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "10458-301-550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FREN-313", "path": "/courses/10458", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10458/sections", "values": [{"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/10458/sections/301", "id": "10458-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}]}, "id": 10458, "aliases": ["FREN-313"]}
