On completion of the course, students will also have the opportunity to take the Diplome de Francais Professionnel-DFP Affaires (C1) administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20226/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.15", "rDifficulty": "1.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.46", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "1.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.46", "rCommAbility": "2.54", "rInstructorQuality": "2.77"}, "section": {"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/20226/sections/301", "id": "20226-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/20226/sections/301/reviews/3311-ROBIN-ARONOW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3311-ROBIN-ARONOW", "first_name": "ROBIN", "last_name": "ARONOW", "id": "3311-ROBIN-ARONOW", "name": "ROBIN ARONOW"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "20226-301-3311-ROBIN-ARONOW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FREN-313", "path": "/courses/20226", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20226/sections", "values": [{"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/20226/sections/301", "id": "20226-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}]}, "id": 20226, "aliases": ["FREN-313"]}
