{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/509"}, "description": "The course, conducted entirely in French, emphasizes verbal communication in business professional situations through three components. First, a series of student's presentations, in-class activities (using newspapers' articles, technical readings, radio shows and films), and debates on the following topics (list not exhaustive) related to France's economy and society: The role of the State in France's economy; the French fiscal system; Labor (impact of the 35-hour work week, \"conges,\" women in the workplace, etc.); Regions of France (production); major French industries/companies/brands; France's major imports/exports; \"Green business\"; Business of pop culture. \n\nSecond, as effective communication is based not only on linguistic proficiency but also on cultural proficiency, cultural differences mostly between Americans and French will be explored. \n\nFinally, throughout the semester, students will work in groups on the creation of their own business, association, or other organization and will be invited to present their project to the class at the end of the semester. On completion of the course, students will also have the opportunity to take the Diplome de Francais Professionnel-DFP Affaires (C1) administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26100/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.75", "rTAQuality": "3.80", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.50", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.75", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rInstructorConcern": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rClassPace": "1.88", "rExamsConsistent": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rGradeFairness": "3.88", "rArticulateGoals": "3.63", "rOralSkills": "3.63", "rNativeAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rInstructorEffective": "3.75", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/26100/sections/301", "id": "26100-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/26100/sections/301/reviews/4353-NATHALIE-CIESCO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4353-NATHALIE-CIESCO", "first_name": "NATHALIE", "last_name": "CIESCO", "id": "4353-NATHALIE-CIESCO", "name": "NATHALIE CIESCO"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "26100-301-4353-NATHALIE-CIESCO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FREN-313", "path": "/courses/26100", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26100/sections", "values": [{"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/26100/sections/301", "id": "26100-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}]}, "id": 26100, "aliases": ["FREN-313"]}
