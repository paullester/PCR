On completion of the course, students will also have the opportunity to take the Diplome de Francais Professionnel-DFP Affaires (C1) administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1682/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.79", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.08", "rReadingsValue": "1.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "2.93"}, "section": {"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/1682/sections/301", "id": "1682-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/1682/sections/301/reviews/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "first_name": "BETTY J", "last_name": "SLOWINSKI", "id": "550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI", "name": "BETTY J SLOWINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "1682-301-550-BETTY-J-SLOWINSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FREN-313", "path": "/courses/1682", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1682/sections", "values": [{"name": "FR FOR PROFESSIONS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FREN-313-301", "path": "/courses/1682/sections/301", "id": "1682-301", "aliases": ["FREN-313-301"]}]}, "id": 1682, "aliases": ["FREN-313"]}
