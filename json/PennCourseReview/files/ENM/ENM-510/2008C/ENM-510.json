{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1828"}, "description": "This is the first course of a two semester sequence, but each course is self contained. Over the two semesters topics are drawn from various branches of applied mathematics that are relevant to engineering and applied science. These include: Linear Algebra and Vector Spaces, Hilbert spaces, Higher-Dimensional Calculus, Vector Analysis, Differential Geometry, Tensor Analysis, Optimization and Variational Calculus, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Initial-Value and Boundary-Value Problems, Green's Functions, Special Functions, Fourier Analysis, Integral Transforms and Numerical Analysis. The fall course emphasizes the study of Hilbert spaces, ordinary and partial differential equations, the initial-value, boundary-value problem, and related topics. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18616/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.18", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.65", "rWorkRequired": "3.09", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.86", "rCommAbility": "3.09", "rInstructorQuality": "3.14"}, "section": {"name": "FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENM-510-001", "path": "/courses/18616/sections/001", "id": "18616-001", "aliases": ["ENM-510-001"]}, "comments": "ENM 510 is a course that draws on a variety of math concepts that are relevant in engineering and applied science. The syllabus contains topics such as linear vector spaces, ordinary differential equations and boundary value problems, and partial differential equations. Boundary Value Problems is a required textbook and Elementary Linear Algebra, Applications Version is a recommended textbook that serves as a review book for earlier concepts.\r\n\r\nOverall, students greatly enjoyed this course. Most students \u201clearned a ton\u201d and found the course very useful. Professor Carchidi posts notes online to accompany the lectures, and many students found them very helpful. The examples and content covered were valuable.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carchidi was overall an exceptional teacher. Students found him \u201cwell prepared\u201d and \u201corganized\u201d for the most part. His expectations for the class were fair and everyone \u201cknew what to expect.\u201d He was extremely accessible to discuss problems or questions that students had, \u201cno matter how basic.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis class is recommended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have already taken MATH 240 and MATH 241 or equivalents. Students remarked that the homework was very challenging and lengthy. Exams were also quite difficult. This class is designed for engineering students and is not recommended for others.", "num_students": 54, "path": "/courses/18616/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
