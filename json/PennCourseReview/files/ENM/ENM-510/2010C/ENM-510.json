Over the two semesters topics are drawn from various branches of applied mathematics that are relevant to engineering and applied science. These include: Linear Algebra and Vector Spaces, Hilbert spaces, Higher-Dimensional Calculus, Vector Analysis, Differential Geometry, Tensor Analysis, Optimization and Variational Calculus, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Initial-Value and Boundary-Value Problems, Green's Functions, Special Functions, Fourier Analysis, Integral Transforms and Numerical Analysis. The fall course emphasizes the study of Hilbert spaces, ordinary and partial differential equations, the initial-value, boundary-value problem, and related topics. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23010/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "2.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.90", "rWorkRequired": "2.99", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.23", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENM-510-001", "path": "/courses/23010/sections/001", "id": "23010-001", "aliases": ["ENM-510-001"]}, "comments": "This is the first course of a two-semester sequence, but each course is self contained.
