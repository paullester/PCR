{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1828"}, "description": "This is the first course of a two semester sequence, but each course is self contained. Over the two semesters topics are drawn from various branches of applied mathematics that are relevant to engineering and applied science. These include: Linear Algebra and Vector Spaces, Hilbert spaces, Higher-Dimensional Calculus, Vector Analysis, Differential Geometry, Tensor Analysis, Optimization and Variational Calculus, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Initial-Value and Boundary-Value Problems, Green's Functions, Special Functions, Fourier Analysis, Integral Transforms and Numerical Analysis. The fall course emphasizes the study of Hilbert spaces, ordinary and partial differential equations, the initial-value, boundary-value problem, and related topics. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28880/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.74", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.56", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.95", "rCommAbility": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "2.90"}, "section": {"name": "FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENM-510-001", "path": "/courses/28880/sections/001", "id": "28880-001", "aliases": ["ENM-510-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 110, "path": "/courses/28880/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
