Some of the topics covered in the class include combinatorial probabilities, variance, covariance, stochastic models and applications, and Markov chains. The textbook required for the class is called A First Course in Probability.\r\n\r\nStudents found the content of the course to be interesting, but often the material became too theoretical and less practical. Many students called for more practical examples and applications to make the course more interesting. Most students learned very much from the class and found it beneficial to take.\r\n\r\nMost students greatly enjoyed Professor Venkatesh\u2019s teaching style. One student remarked his classes were \u201csome of the most interesting lectures I have ever attended.\u201d Others described him as \u201cexcellent\u201d and his lectures as full of \u201ccoherent and logical exposition.\u201d Students also found him to be very accessible and helpful.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is an introduction to probability, this class is designed for advanced undergraduates and early graduate students that have not taken a probability class. Undergraduates need MATH 240 or an equivalent class as a prerequisite. Students described the class as \u201cvery challenging\u201d and remarked that the homework was very time consuming. A number of students also disliked the textbook and the examples it provided.", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/18615/sections/001/reviews/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "first_name": "SANTOSH S", "last_name": "VENKATESH", "id": "1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "name": "SANTOSH S VENKATESH"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "18615-001-1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENM-503", "path": "/courses/18615", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18615/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO PROB & STAT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENM-503-001", "path": "/courses/18615/sections/001", "id": "18615-001", "aliases": ["ENM-503-001"]}]}, "id": 18615, "aliases": ["ENM-503"]}
