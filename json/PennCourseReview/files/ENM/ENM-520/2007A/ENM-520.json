{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2796"}, "description": "This course is targeted to engineering PhD students in all areas. It will focus on the stud of linear spaces (both finite and infinite dimensional) and of operators defined on such spaces. This course will also show students how powerful methods developed by the study of linear spaces can be used to systematically solve problems in engineering. The emphasis in this course will not be on abstract theory and proofs but on techniques that can be used to solve problems. Some examples of techniques that will be studied include, Fourier eries, Green's functions for ordinary and partial differential operators, eigenvalue problems for ordinary differential equations, singular value decomposition of matrices, etc. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "COMP ODE/PDE OPT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14430/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "COMP ODE/PDE OPT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENM-520-001", "path": "/courses/14430/sections/001", "id": "14430-001", "aliases": ["ENM-520-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/14430/sections/001/reviews/2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "first_name": "GEORGE", "last_name": "BIROS", "id": "2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "name": "GEORGE BIROS"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "14430-001-2549-GEORGE-BIROS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENM-520", "path": "/courses/14430", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14430/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP ODE/PDE OPT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENM-520-001", "path": "/courses/14430/sections/001", "id": "14430-001", "aliases": ["ENM-520-001"]}]}, "id": 14430, "aliases": ["ENM-520"]}
