The professor also liked to \u201cskip over some steps,\u201d causing students to become \u201clost or confused\u201d in the process.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carchidi was extremely helpful, and he would often \u201chelp with the homework\u201d whenever he had office hours.\r\n\r\nOverall, some students suggested that \u201cthis course may be better if it was taken after Math 241 rather than in place of it.\u201d Although the material was difficult, it was easy to obtain a good mark because the professors helped with the homework and the midterms were take-home. The workload in general was quite significant, so the course is suggested for Majors only.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 7 student comments which were submitted.
