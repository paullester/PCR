The primary goal of the course is to provide a broad background in numerical methods. Most of the applications will be based on the use of MATLAB software. Topics will include numerical linear algebra, solution of linear systems of equations, nonlinear equations, nonlinear equations, integration of ordinary differential equations, and solutions of partial differential equations by finite difference and finite element methods.\r\n\r\nMany students liked the material presented and agreed that the course was \u201cinteresting\u201d. Students also praised the \u201cvery thorough\u201d course material citing that they \u201clearned a great deal about different types of numerical methods\u201d. Although some found the course difficult without prior MATLAB experience and thought that \u201cmore practical examples would be useful\u201d, others thought the course moved \u201cextremely slow because the material [was] repeated multiple times\u201d.\r\n\r\nAlthough, some students enjoyed Professor Sinno\u2019s teaching style in that it kept students \u201cattentive and challenged\u201d; others found Professor Sinno to be \u201cabrasive\u201d, \u201cdisorganized\u201d, and \u201cunapproachable\u201d. Overall, students lamented his \u201cintimidating\u201d attitude, with one student noting \u201c[the professor's] reluctance to respond to him\u201d and his own subsequent inability to \"ask questions\".\r\n\r\nOverall, students found the class to be \u201cappropriately challenging on the graduate level\u201d. Students had a mixed opinion on the projects \u2013 some thought there was not enough connection to the lecture while others thought there was not enough time to complete the assignments. However, many students felt accomplished seeing their completed projects. Students commented that this course should not be recommended for those with little prior programming experience, especially in MATLAB.
