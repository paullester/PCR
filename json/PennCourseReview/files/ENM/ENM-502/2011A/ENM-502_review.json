The primary goal of the course is to provide a broad background in numerical methods. Most of the applications are MATLAB based. Topics include numerical linear algebra, solution of linear systems of equations, non-linear equations, integration of ordinary differential equations, and solution of partial differential equations. &#8232;&#8232;Students generally found that this course covered \u201creally interesting concepts,\u201d but stated that it emphasized the need for a strong linear algebra background. &#8232;&#8232;Students felt that Prof. Sinno \u201cdidn\u2019t culture a learning environment in which students felt comfortable speaking their mind.\u201d Some agreed that although he was effective at communicating the course concepts, he was \u201ccondescending\u201d toward students who did not understand the material.
