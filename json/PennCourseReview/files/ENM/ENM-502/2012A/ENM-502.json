Interpolation and curve fitting, numerical integration, solution of ordinary and partial differential equations by finite difference, and finite element methods are taught.\r\n\r\nMany students enjoyed the class, with one writing that it was \u201cwell-executed.\u201d However, one student expressed skepticism regarding the relevance of the course, as it involved programming models that were already well-implemented in Matlab. Another student wished that programming for the assignments would have \u201cat least minor importance\u201d towards evaluation, as it was by far the most time-consuming portion.\r\n\r\nOne student praised the TA Ian as a great and accessible instructor.\r\n\r\nMany students commented that the assignments were very difficult. A student noted that the course required \u201csignificant prior experience with Matlab,\u201d as well 30 to 40 hours of work outside of class each week.\r\nThis course review was written based on the seven student comments submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/27344/sections/001/reviews/217-TALID-R--SINNO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/217-TALID-R--SINNO", "first_name": "TALID R.", "last_name": "SINNO", "id": "217-TALID-R--SINNO", "name": "TALID R.
