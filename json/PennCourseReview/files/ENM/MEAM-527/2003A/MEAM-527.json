{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/733"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to equip students with the background needed to carry out finite elements-based simulations of various engineering problems. The first part of the course will outline the theory of finite elements. The second part of the course will address the solution of classical equations of mathematical physics such as Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz, the wave and the Heat equations. The third part of the course will consist of case studies taken from various areas of engineering and the sciences on topics that require or can benefit from finite element modeling. The students will gain hand-on experience with the multi-physics, finite element package FemLab. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "NUM & FINITE ELE MTHDS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1903/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "1.55", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "2.09", "rWorkRequired": "3.09", "rInstructorAccess": "2.27", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.89", "rCommAbility": "2.09", "rInstructorQuality": "2.18"}, "section": {"name": "NUM & FINITE ELE MTHDS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-527-001", "path": "/courses/1903/sections/001", "id": "1903-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-527-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/1903/sections/001/reviews/776-NOAM-LIOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/776-NOAM-LIOR", "first_name": "NOAM", "last_name": "LIOR", "id": "776-NOAM-LIOR", "name": "NOAM LIOR"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "1903-001-776-NOAM-LIOR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-527", "path": "/courses/1903", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1903/sections", "values": [{"name": "NUM & FINITE ELE MTHDS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-527-001", "path": "/courses/1903/sections/001", "id": "1903-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-527-001"]}]}, "id": 1903, "aliases": ["MEAM-527"]}
