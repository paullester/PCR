{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/733"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to equip students with the background needed to carry out finite elements-based simulations of various engineering problems. The first part of the course will outline the theory of finite elements. The second part of the course will address the solution of classical equations of mathematical physics such as Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz, the wave and the Heat equations. The third part of the course will consist of case studies taken from various areas of engineering and the sciences on topics that require or can benefit from finite element modeling. The students will gain hand-on experience with the multi-physics, finite element package FemLab. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "NUM & FIN ELE MTHDS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24727/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.76", "rDifficulty": "3.10", "rStimulateInterest": "1.83", "rRecommendMajor": "2.85", "rCourseQuality": "2.54", "rWorkRequired": "3.02", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.98", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.98", "rCommAbility": "2.15", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "NUM & FIN ELE MTHDS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-527-401", "path": "/courses/24727/sections/401", "id": "24727-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-527-401", "ENM-427-401"]}, "comments": "This course introduces common kinematic, dynamic, and computational\r\nprinciples and practical examples that are representative of today\u2019s robotic systems. The\r\nthree main topics are coordinate system transformations and kinematics, control of\r\nmobile robots, and motion planning of robotic systems. The laboratory component\r\nincludes simulation exercises, programming, and numerical modeling using effective\r\nalgorithms with applications to problems in engineering, science, and mathematics.\r\nOther topics include interpolation and curve fitting, numerical integration, introduction to\r\nthe solution of ordinary and partial differential equations by finite difference, and finite\r\nelement methods.\r\nThe majority of the students felt that this course was overall difficult, abstract,\r\nand \u201cinvolved a lot of math\u201d but that eventually they learnt a lot. Yet some noted that the\r\ntopics were interesting and the course was helpful for students majoring in MEAM. One\r\nstudent thought that the lack of a proper textbook and relevant tutors was a noticeable\r\nproblem.\r\nProfessor Hu was described as \u201cexcellent in accessibility and willingness to\r\ndiscuss with students when they encounter problems.\u201d His notes were regarded as \u201cvery\r\nuseful.\u201d Students praised that Professor Hu \u201cincorporated several real-world example\r\nproblems\u201d in class but hoped that he could give clearer presentations.\r\nStudents should be prepared to put in a good deal of work for this course.
