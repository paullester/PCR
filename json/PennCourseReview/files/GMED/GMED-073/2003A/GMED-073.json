{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/535"}, "description": "Topics vary each semester. GH medicine courses are designed for undergraduates interested in considering human diseases from many aspects-biological, clinical and social. An attempt will be made to use each disease to illustrate modern approaches in biomedical research, problems in health maintenance and care, and socio-political effects of common severe disorders. The courses are not designed to provide technical information to premedical students in preparation for professional school. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "INFECTIOUS DISEASES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1709/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.86", "rDifficulty": "1.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.95", "rRecommendMajor": "3.95", "rCourseQuality": "3.95", "rWorkRequired": "1.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.86", "rCommAbility": "3.95", "rInstructorQuality": "3.95"}, "section": {"name": "INFECTIOUS DISEASES", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "GMED-073-302", "path": "/courses/1709/sections/302", "id": "1709-302", "aliases": ["GMED-073-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/1709/sections/302/reviews/178-HELEN-CONRAD-DAVIES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/178-HELEN-CONRAD-DAVIES", "first_name": "HELEN CONRAD", "last_name": "DAVIES", "id": "178-HELEN-CONRAD-DAVIES", "name": "HELEN CONRAD DAVIES"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "1709-302-178-HELEN-CONRAD-DAVIES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GMED-073", "path": "/courses/1709", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1709/sections", "values": [{"name": "INFECTIOUS DISEASES", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "GMED-073-302", "path": "/courses/1709/sections/302", "id": "1709-302", "aliases": ["GMED-073-302"]}]}, "id": 1709, "aliases": ["GMED-073"]}
