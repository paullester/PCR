{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3139"}, "description": "This course is for students with an advanced background in Japanese. This course aims to strengthen knowledge of Kanji (Chinese characters) in Japanese, so that the level of reading and writing will be well balanced with the level of listening and speaking, in particular in order to prepare for Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 2 or above. It is appropriate for those who know approximately 500 Kanji and have oral proficiency levels higher than Intermediate-Mid according to ACTFL guidelines. Since the Japanese Language Proficiency Test is administered in December every year, if you wish to fully prepare for the test, the instructor recommends that you take JPAN 482 first in the spring of the same year. For example, if you plan to take the test in December, 2012, start taking 482 in the spring 2012 and take 481 in the fall 2012. Different from other courses, this full-year course begins in the spring and ends in the fall, because the test is given in December. However, participation in 482 is optional. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "JAPANESE/PROFESSIONS IV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.43", "rTAQuality": "1.60", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.43", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.57", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rInstructorConcern": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rClassPace": "2.29", "rExamsConsistent": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rGradeFairness": "3.33", "rArticulateGoals": "3.14", "rOralSkills": "3.00", "rNativeAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rInstructorEffective": "3.43", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "JAPANESE/PROFESSIONS IV", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "JPAN-482-680", "path": "/courses/7941/sections/680", "id": "7941-680", "aliases": ["JPAN-482-680"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/7941/sections/680/reviews/3024-MISAKO-CHAPMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3024-MISAKO-CHAPMAN", "first_name": "MISAKO", "last_name": "CHAPMAN", "id": "3024-MISAKO-CHAPMAN", "name": "MISAKO CHAPMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "7941-680-3024-MISAKO-CHAPMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "JPAN-482", "path": "/courses/7941", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7941/sections", "values": [{"name": "JAPANESE/PROFESSIONS IV", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "JPAN-482-680", "path": "/courses/7941/sections/680", "id": "7941-680", "aliases": ["JPAN-482-680"]}]}, "id": 7941, "aliases": ["JPAN-482"]}
