{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1012"}, "description": "In Intermediate Hindi the student continues to develop the four language skills, with an emphasis on real-life situations--through hearing and practicing conversation on everyday topics, reading a variety of authentic texts ranging from advertisements to short stories, watching segments of current films, and carrying out short research projects using Hindi sources. There is a strong emphasis on vocabulary development and on using contextually appropriate styles of spoken and written Hindi. \n\nThis course presupposes a knowledge of oral and literacy skills covered in Beginning Hindi. In order to get a passing grade at the end of two semesters, students enrolled in SARS 212 must achieve a level of Intermediate-Mid in all four skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). This fulfills the undergraduate language requirement. Students enrolled in SARS 512 must demonstrate a level of Intermediate-High in at least one skill, and Intermediate-Mid in the other three. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "INTERMEDIATE HINDI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2188/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "4.00", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rGradeFairness": "3.80", "rArticulateGoals": "3.80", "rOralSkills": "3.80", "rNativeAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "3.40", "rSkillEmphasis": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE HINDI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-212-401", "path": "/courses/2188/sections/401", "id": "2188-401", "aliases": ["SARS-212-401", "SARS-512-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/2188/sections/401/reviews/1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "first_name": "VIJAY", "last_name": "GAMBHIR", "id": "1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "name": "VIJAY GAMBHIR"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "2188-401-1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-212", "path": "/courses/2188", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2188/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE HINDI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-212-401", "path": "/courses/2188/sections/401", "id": "2188-401", "aliases": ["SARS-212-401", "SARS-512-401"]}]}, "id": 2188, "aliases": ["SARS-212", "SARS-512"]}
