{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2923"}, "description": "The Dravidian language family consists of over 200 million speakers of at least four literary languages and many smaller groups, located mainly in the south of India. Some of these languages have long literary histories, and consider themselves a separate \"civilization,\" dating back to the cultures of Mohenjo-Daro or earlier. The question of who the Dravidians are, what their history is, and how they fit into the larger picture of South Asian history and culture is problematical. This course will try to answer some of these questions. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "WHO ARE THE DRAVIDIANS?", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7117/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-238", "path": "/courses/7117", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7117/sections", "values": [{"name": "WHO ARE THE DRAVIDIANS?", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-238-401", "path": "/courses/7117/sections/401", "id": "7117-401", "aliases": ["SARS-238-401", "SARS-538-401"]}]}, "id": 7117, "aliases": ["SARS-238", "SARS-538"]}
