{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1014"}, "description": "This is a fast paced course for learners who have some degree of listening and speaking skills in Hindi, but have minimal or no literacy skills. In the Fall semester students acquire basic reading and writing skills and advance their speaking and listening skills to be able to communicate on everyday personal and social topics in Hindi. Grammatical accuracy and sociocultural appropriateness are emphasized throughout the course. In the Spring semester, students continue to advance all the linguistic skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing) and functions (narration, description, supporting opinion) with a special focus on reading and writing. Students develop formal vocabulary through authentic oral and written input rich in content and culture. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ACCELERATED HINDI I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7111/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.46", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.38", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.62", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rInstructorConcern": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rClassPace": "2.46", "rExamsConsistent": "3.54", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rGradeFairness": "3.46", "rArticulateGoals": "3.31", "rOralSkills": "3.54", "rNativeAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "1.23", "rStimulateInterest": "3.08", "rInstructorEffective": "3.31", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "ACCELERATED HINDI I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-216-401", "path": "/courses/7111/sections/401", "id": "7111-401", "aliases": ["SARS-216-401", "SARS-516-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/7111/sections/401/reviews/1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "first_name": "VIJAY", "last_name": "GAMBHIR", "id": "1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "name": "VIJAY GAMBHIR"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "7111-401-1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-216", "path": "/courses/7111", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7111/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACCELERATED HINDI I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-216-401", "path": "/courses/7111/sections/401", "id": "7111-401", "aliases": ["SARS-216-401", "SARS-516-401"]}]}, "id": 7111, "aliases": ["SARS-216", "SARS-516"]}
