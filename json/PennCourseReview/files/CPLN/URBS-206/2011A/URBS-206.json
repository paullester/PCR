{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1133"}, "description": "The Public Environment of Cities explores urbanism - the study of the environmental, political, economic, socio-cultural, historical, and aesthetic conditions affecting urban life and culture. At the heart of urbanism is our public environment - the parks, squares, and sidewalks in and upon which our public life is played out. The course will explore the city through the examination of three broad themes: Democracy, Diversity, and Design. We examine in detail how contemporary issues affect our perceptions, use, and inhabitation of the public environment and how the open spaces of the city provide frameworks for the daily social life and commerce as well as the important ceremonies, celebrations, and festivities of its inhabitants. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "PUBLIC ENVIRON OF CITIES: Introduction to the Urban Landscape", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22520/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.60", "rDifficulty": "1.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "1.82", "rWorkRequired": "1.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.55"}, "section": {"name": "PUBLIC ENVIRON OF CITIES: Introduction to the Urban Landscape", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-206-401", "path": "/courses/22520/sections/401", "id": "22520-401", "aliases": ["URBS-206-401", "CPLN-672-401", "URBS-506-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/22520/sections/401/reviews/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "first_name": "MICHAEL P", "last_name": "NAIRN", "id": "2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "name": "MICHAEL P NAIRN"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "22520-401-2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-206", "path": "/courses/22520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22520/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC ENVIRON OF CITIES: Introduction to the Urban Landscape", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-206-401", "path": "/courses/22520/sections/401", "id": "22520-401", "aliases": ["URBS-206-401", "CPLN-672-401", "URBS-506-401"]}]}, "id": 22520, "aliases": ["URBS-206", "CPLN-672", "URBS-506"]}
