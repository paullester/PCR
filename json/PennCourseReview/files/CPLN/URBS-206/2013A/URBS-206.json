{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1133"}, "description": "This course will explore the role of public spaces - streets, boulevards, parks and squares - in cities and their social uses. With the University of Pennsylvania campus and the City of Philadelphia serving as our laboratory, we will critically examine the evolution of the movement of corridors, open space and buildings of the urban landscape and their changing uses. Case studies of social spaces on campus and public open spaces in Center City will help inform our understanding of how public environment serves, well or poorly, the varying needs of diverse users. While graphic skills are not required, graphic means as well as writing will be employed to communicate critical thought, ideas, and conclusions. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT OF CITIES: AN INTRO TO THE URBAN LANDSCAPE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31099/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.31", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.54", "rCourseQuality": "1.38", "rWorkRequired": "1.77", "rInstructorQuality": "1.46", "rCommAbility": "1.46", "rInstructorAccess": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "THE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT OF CITIES: AN INTRO TO THE URBAN LANDSCAPE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-206-401", "path": "/courses/31099/sections/401", "id": "31099-401", "aliases": ["URBS-206-401", "URBS-506-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/31099/sections/401/reviews/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "first_name": "MICHAEL P", "last_name": "NAIRN", "id": "2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "name": "MICHAEL P NAIRN"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "31099-401-2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-206", "path": "/courses/31099", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31099/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT OF CITIES: AN INTRO TO THE URBAN LANDSCAPE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-206-401", "path": "/courses/31099/sections/401", "id": "31099-401", "aliases": ["URBS-206-401", "URBS-506-401"]}]}, "id": 31099, "aliases": ["URBS-206", "URBS-506"]}
