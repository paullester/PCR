{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3787"}, "description": "This workshop class will participate in an international design competition soliciting new ideas for reusing vacant land in Philadelphia. It will explore the history, ecology, and social life of a cross-section of the citys neighborhoods, with particular attention to the challenges vacant land poses for planning, development, and environmental design. Students will tour several neighborhoods, meet with community and civic groups, and develop specific plans for submission in the competition. No prior design skills are required, though the class will employ a variety of hand- and computer-based mapping and graphic techniques. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "RE-IMAGINING PHILA: Environmental Design Workshop", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12513/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.77", "rCourseQuality": "2.85", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.15", "rCommAbility": "2.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "RE-IMAGINING PHILA: Environmental Design Workshop", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-360-401", "path": "/courses/12513/sections/401", "id": "12513-401", "aliases": ["URBS-360-401", "CPLN-560-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/12513/sections/401/reviews/2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "first_name": "DOMENIC", "last_name": "VITIELLO", "id": "2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "name": "DOMENIC VITIELLO"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "12513-401-2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "2.62", "rRecommendMajor": "2.85", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "3.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "3.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.23", "rCommAbility": "2.54", "rInstructorQuality": "2.69"}, "section": {"name": "RE-IMAGINING PHILA: Environmental Design Workshop", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-360-401", "path": "/courses/12513/sections/401", "id": "12513-401", "aliases": ["URBS-360-401", "CPLN-560-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/12513/sections/401/reviews/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "first_name": "MICHAEL P", "last_name": "NAIRN", "id": "2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "name": "MICHAEL P NAIRN"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "12513-401-2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-360", "path": "/courses/12513", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12513/sections", "values": [{"name": "RE-IMAGINING PHILA: Environmental Design Workshop", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-360-401", "path": "/courses/12513/sections/401", "id": "12513-401", "aliases": ["URBS-360-401", "CPLN-560-401"]}]}, "id": 12513, "aliases": ["URBS-360", "CPLN-560"]}
