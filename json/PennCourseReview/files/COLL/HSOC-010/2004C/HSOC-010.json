{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1927"}, "description": "\"Two fundamental questions structure this course: (1)What kinds of factors shape population health in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century? and (2)What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper \"socialness\" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. \"Health and Societies: Global Perspectives\" blends the methods of history, sociology, anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward, common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic, student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today.\" \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5470/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "2.51", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.09", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.39", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.54"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-401", "path": "/courses/5470/sections/401", "id": "5470-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-401", "HSSC-010-401", "COLL-002-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 92, "path": "/courses/5470/sections/401/reviews/661-JANET-TIGHE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/661-JANET-TIGHE", "first_name": "JANET", "last_name": "TIGHE", "id": "661-JANET-TIGHE", "name": "JANET TIGHE"}, "num_reviewers": 67, "id": "5470-401-661-JANET-TIGHE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-010", "path": "/courses/5470", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5470/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-401", "path": "/courses/5470/sections/401", "id": "5470-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-401", "HSSC-010-401", "COLL-002-401"]}]}, "id": 5470, "aliases": ["HSOC-010", "HSSC-010", "COLL-002"]}
