{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1927"}, "description": "\"Two fundamental questions structure this course: (1)What kinds of factors shape population health in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century? and (2)What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper \"socialness\" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. \"Health and Societies: Global Perspectives\" blends the methods of history, sociology, anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward, common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic, student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today.\" \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30476/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.43", "rTAQuality": "3.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.65", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.12", "rInstructorAccess": "2.66"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-001", "path": "/courses/30476/sections/001", "id": "30476-001", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 127, "path": "/courses/30476/sections/001/reviews/5766-KATHERINE-MASON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5766-KATHERINE-MASON", "first_name": "KATHERINE", "last_name": "MASON", "id": "5766-KATHERINE-MASON", "name": "KATHERINE MASON"}, "num_reviewers": 113, "id": "30476-001-5766-KATHERINE-MASON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-010", "path": "/courses/30476", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30476/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-001", "path": "/courses/30476/sections/001", "id": "30476-001", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-001"]}]}, "id": 30476, "aliases": ["HSOC-010"]}
