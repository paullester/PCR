{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1927"}, "description": "\"Two fundamental questions structure this course: (1)What kinds of factors shape population health in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century? and (2)What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper \"socialness\" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. \"Health and Societies: Global Perspectives\" blends the methods of history, sociology, anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward, common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic, student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today.\" \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3117/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.79", "rDifficulty": "2.61", "rStimulateInterest": "2.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.61", "rWorkRequired": "3.39", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-401", "path": "/courses/3117/sections/401", "id": "3117-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-401", "HSSC-010-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/3117/sections/401/reviews/661-JANET-TIGHE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/661-JANET-TIGHE", "first_name": "JANET", "last_name": "TIGHE", "id": "661-JANET-TIGHE", "name": "JANET TIGHE"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "3117-401-661-JANET-TIGHE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-010", "path": "/courses/3117", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3117/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-401", "path": "/courses/3117/sections/401", "id": "3117-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-401", "HSSC-010-401"]}]}, "id": 3117, "aliases": ["HSOC-010", "HSSC-010"]}
