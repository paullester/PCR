{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1927"}, "description": "\"Two fundamental questions structure this course: (1)What kinds of factors shape population health in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century? and (2)What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper \"socialness\" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. \"Health and Societies: Global Perspectives\" blends the methods of history, sociology, anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward, common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic, student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today.\" \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15926/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "1.98", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.52", "rInstructorAccess": "2.51", "rReadingsValue": "2.41", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-001", "path": "/courses/15926/sections/001", "id": "15926-001", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-001"]}, "comments": "This course is an introduction to the vocabulary, skills, and concepts basic to sociocultural studies of health and disease. While recognizing the importance of the biomedical model, particularly to Western civilization, the course asks students to explore other approaches and healing traditions. It does so by exploring how policy analysts, medical care providers, and scholars from a variety of disciplines including anthropology, history and sociology have crafted responses to such real world problems as malnutrition, epidemic disease, and the inequitable distribution of health resources.&#8232;\r\nStudents found the course \u201cchoppy\u201d and said it was \u201cdifficult to understand the overarching goal\u201d due to a large number of guest lecturers. Overall students were interested in the material, but as one put it, \u201cWith some more structuring and more clear cut goals and intentions, I think students would be less frustrated with the course.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Beam did lecture, students said that his \u201cknowledge and personal experience in the subject matter enriched his lecture portions.\u201d But many students were dismayed that the class seemed one-sided, saying \u201cDr. Bream was highly biased in everything from his political to medical views, and the course reflected this entirely.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course is a good introduction to those who are considering the Health and Societies major. Students said that the assignments (one student described them as \u201cmajor research assignments every two weeks\u201d) readings, and culminating final project were very time consuming, but mentioned that Professor Beam was flexible with coursework.", "num_students": 153, "path": "/courses/15926/sections/001/reviews/4377-KENT-D-W--BREAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4377-KENT-D-W--BREAM", "first_name": "KENT D.W.", "last_name": "BREAM", "id": "4377-KENT-D-W--BREAM", "name": "KENT D.W.
