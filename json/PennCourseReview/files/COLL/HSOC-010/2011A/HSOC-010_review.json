And (2) What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper \"socialness\" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. This course blends the methods of history, sociology, anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward, common-sense responses to biological phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to research strategies in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic, student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today.\r\n\r\nStudents described the course as \u201cawesome.\u201d Students \u201cwant to go to lectures,\u201d although some felt it could have been better organized and less repetitive. One student felt the course \u201ccompletely changed\u201d his view on global health. It is \u201ca good class to take regardless of major.\u201d \r\n\r\nMany students raved about what an \u201camazing professor\u201d Dr. Barnes is. \u201cYou could tell that he really loved what he was teaching,\u201d and that passion was contagious. He is a stimulating lecturer and is \u201ctruly concerned about the well-being of his students.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents felt \u201cthe amount of work if you are not interested would be overwhelming.\u201d The class \u201chas a TON of assignments, many of which seem unrelated to the course work.\u201d However, students were pleased that the readings remained \u201crelevant\u201d and did not seem like \u201cthey had been in the course pack for years without being updated.\u201d One student mentioned that the \u201cend of the semester is very work-heavy, with two major projects within two weeks of each other.\u201d This course fulfills the Humanities and Social Science sector.\r\n", "num_students": 107, "path": "/courses/21887/sections/001/reviews/1520-DAVID-S--BARNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1520-DAVID-S--BARNES", "first_name": "DAVID S.", "last_name": "BARNES", "id": "1520-DAVID-S--BARNES", "name": "DAVID S.
