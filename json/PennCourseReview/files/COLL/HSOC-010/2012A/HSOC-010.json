{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1927"}, "description": "\"Two fundamental questions structure this course: (1)What kinds of factors shape population health in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century? and (2)What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper \"socialness\" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. \"Health and Societies: Global Perspectives\" blends the methods of history, sociology, anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward, common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic, student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today.\" \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27600/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "3.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.77", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH & SOCIETIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HSOC-010-001", "path": "/courses/27600/sections/001", "id": "27600-001", "aliases": ["HSOC-010-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 113, "path": "/courses/27600/sections/001/reviews/1520-DAVID-S--BARNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1520-DAVID-S--BARNES", "first_name": "DAVID S.", "last_name": "BARNES", "id": "1520-DAVID-S--BARNES", "name": "DAVID S.
