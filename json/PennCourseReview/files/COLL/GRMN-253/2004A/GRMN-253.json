{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2833"}, "description": "No other person of the twentieth century has probably influenced scientific thought, humanistic scholarship, medical therapy, and popular culture as much as Sigmund Freud. This course will study his work, its cultural background, and its impact on us today. \n\nIn the first part of the course, we will learn about Freud's life and the Viennese culture of his time. We will then move to a discussion of seminal texts, such as excerpts from his Interpretation of Dreams, case studies, as well as essays on psychoanalytic practice, human development, definitions of gender and sex, neuroses, and culture in general. In the final part of the course, we will discuss the impact of Freud's work. Guest lectureres from the medical field, history of science, psychology, and the humnities will offer insights into the reception of Freud's work, and its consequences for various fields of study and therapy. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "FREUD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6631/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.51", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.53", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "FREUD", "sectionnum": "411", "primary_alias": "GRMN-253-411", "path": "/courses/6631/sections/411", "id": "6631-411", "aliases": ["GRMN-253-411", "COML-253-411", "WSTD-252-411", "HSSC-253-411", "COLL-002-411", "HSOC-253-411"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 92, "path": "/courses/6631/sections/411/reviews/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "first_name": "LILIANE", "last_name": "WEISSBERG", "id": "1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "name": "LILIANE WEISSBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 55, "id": "6631-411-1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-253", "path": "/courses/6631", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6631/sections", "values": [{"name": "FREUD", "sectionnum": "411", "primary_alias": "GRMN-253-411", "path": "/courses/6631/sections/411", "id": "6631-411", "aliases": ["GRMN-253-411", "COML-253-411", "WSTD-252-411", "HSSC-253-411", "COLL-002-411", "HSOC-253-411"]}]}, "id": 6631, "aliases": ["GRMN-253", "COML-253", "WSTD-252", "HSSC-253", "COLL-002", "HSOC-253"]}
