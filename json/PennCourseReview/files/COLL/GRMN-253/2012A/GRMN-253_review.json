This course studies his work, its cultural background, and its impact on us today.  In the first part of the course, students learn about Freud's life and the Viennese culture of his time.  The course then move to a discussion of seminal texts, such as excerpts from his Interpretation of Dreams, case studies, as well as essays on psychoanalytic practice, human development, definitions of gender and sex, neuroses, and culture in general.  In the final part of the course, students discuss the impact of Freud's work.  Guest lecturers from the medical field, history of science, psychology, and the humanities offer insights into the reception of Freud's work, and its consequences for various fields of study and therapy.\r\n\r\n\tMost students found this class to be stimulating and enjoyable, citing it as \u201can excellent way to gain an informative understanding of Sigmund Freud and the world's reaction to psychoanalysis.\u201d  While there was a common sentiment that \u201ceach class was more compelling and entertaining than the next,\u201d some found there to be \u201ca lack of clear structure in the lectures and assignments\u201d which thus made the class \u201cdifficult to follow\u201d at times.\r\n\r\n\tStudents described Professor Weissberg as \u201can excellent lecturer\u201d who \u201creally made an effort to connect with everyone in the class, even though it was a larger lecture.\u201d  Students reported that Professor Weissberg was \u201chighly qualified\u201d to teach this course as a result of her extensive research pertaining to the topic, but that her lectures could \u201csometimes be a little bit hard to follow,\u201d and that it would have been \u201chelpful if there were Powerpoint slides to help guide the lectures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tIn terms of workload, students reported that there were  \u201ctwo papers which [had to] be written for this course, as well as a creative project and a final exam.\u201d  One student commented that there was \u201ca lot of flexibility in choosing the topics\u201d for the essays, and another student stated that the final \u201casked straightforward questions\u201d that anyone with a strong knowledge of course material could answer well.  Many students reported there was \u201ca lot of reading,\u201d but that \u201cstudents [could] get by without completing all of the assigned texts.\u201d  Overall, the class was recommended as \u201ca fantastic course for non-majors who are looking for a quirky course.\u201d", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/27511/sections/401/reviews/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "first_name": "LILIANE", "last_name": "WEISSBERG", "id": "1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "name": "LILIANE WEISSBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 54, "id": "27511-401-1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG"}]
