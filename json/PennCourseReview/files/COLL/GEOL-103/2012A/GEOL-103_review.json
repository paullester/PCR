This course explores the natural and social science of disturbances by analyzing their geologic causes, their ecological and social consequences, and the role of human behavior in disaster reduction and mitigation. Volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires, and extraterrestrial impacts are analyzed and compared.\r\n\r\n\tStudents mostly found the class boring and uninteresting, though many agreed it was a good way to fulfill one of the college\u2019s requirements.  One student described the course as \u201cdense and static,\u201d while another said, \u201cit was difficult to be engaged with the material.\u201d   Students seemed to feel that they did not learn very much from the course, with one student going so far as to say, \u201cthere is no information I am going to take away from this course moving forward.\u201d  \r\n\r\n\tStudents described Professor Scatena as very uninteresting in lectures especially since he speaks in \u201cmonotone.\u201d  One student noted that he teaches in a \u201cnonchalant and unenthusiastic way.\u201d  His slides were described as \u201cincoherent\u201d and students felt that there was a disconnect between lecture material and what was on the exams.  Students said Professor Scatena was \u201cvery accessible\u201d outside of class and was very willing to help students further understand the material.  Additionally, one student mentioned that Professor Scatena \u201ccared a lot about the subject and the success of his students.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tThis course was recommended for students trying to fulfill requirements in the college.  One student said it \u201cwas perfect to fulfill the science requirement if you are trying to get out of taking a hard class.\u201d  However, several students noted that the class requires constant studying because there are three midterms, and the \u201cexams are very difficult\u201d which require \u201cpure memorization.\u201d", "num_students": 197, "path": "/courses/27483/sections/001/reviews/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "first_name": "FREDERICK N.", "last_name": "SCATENA", "id": "1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "name": "FREDERICK N.
