The workload was not very intense and the material fairly accessible, though relatively dry. One student complained about the price of the textbook and the clicker for this course, stating that in all his four years at Penn, the combined cost for materials for a class had never been as high as for GEOL-103. The homework assignments set throughout the course were described as being fairly easy and straightforward, although exams were touted as being \u201csurprisingly difficult.\\\"", "num_students": 106, "path": "/courses/15821/sections/001/reviews/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "first_name": "FREDERICK N.", "last_name": "SCATENA", "id": "1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "name": "FREDERICK N.
