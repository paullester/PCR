He was very dedicated in involving the class and kept the material interesting. Yet students sometimes found that Professor Scatena was disorganized during his lectures, making it hard to understand the course material. In addition, students did not like that Professor Scatena often just read straight from his lecture slides.\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the Physical World sector requirement. Student found that the exams were far too detailed, and focused on small details rather than major concepts. However, students said that the curve on the exams was very forgiving.\r\n", "num_students": 209, "path": "/courses/21777/sections/001/reviews/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "first_name": "FREDERICK N.", "last_name": "SCATENA", "id": "1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "name": "FREDERICK N.
