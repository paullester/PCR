The goal of this class is to obtain a scientific understanding of the\r\nentire Earth system by describing its component parts (lithosphere, hydrosphere,\r\natmosphere, biosphere) and their interactions, and describe how they have evolved, how\r\nthey function, and how they are expected to respond to human activity. Students work to\r\ndevelop the capability to predict those changes that will occur in the next decade, both\r\nnaturally and in response to human activity. Natural and human-generated energy is used\r\nas a unifying principle. Knowledge gained through this course helps students make\r\ninformed decisions in all spheres of human activity: science, policy, economics, etc.\r\nMany students commented that homework assignments involved a lot of busy\r\nwork and were very tedious.
