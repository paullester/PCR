{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3647"}, "description": "Who am I? What makes the creative act of representing the self different from representing another? Can the essential self be depicted authentically? Or is what is essential precisely that which can never be represented? Does the act of self-representation change the subject? Is a picture worth a thousand words, or can words provide more scope for self-representation? These are the questions at the heart of humanistic studies and questions that every university student wrestles with in some form. \"The Self-Portrait\" will consider these questions from literary and visual perspectives, and will track these issues from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. \n\nThe class will be taught by two professors, and will include both lectures and discussion sections. Students will be exposed to a wide range of self-portraits in literature, the fine arts, and film. Within this framework, we will emphasize the literary and visual examples of Cellini, Goethe, and the Surrealists. In addition to analytical assignments and a final exam, students will prepare their own self-portraits during the semester in the medium of their choice, and our course will culminate in an exhibition of their work. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "THE SELF-PORTRAIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10498/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.74", "rDifficulty": "2.79", "rStimulateInterest": "2.58", "rRecommendMajor": "2.63", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "3.42", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05", "rReadingsValue": "2.32", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.16", "rCommAbility": "2.84", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "THE SELF-PORTRAIT", "sectionnum": "420", "primary_alias": "GRMN-254-420", "path": "/courses/10498/sections/420", "id": "10498-420", "aliases": ["GRMN-254-420", "COLL-004-420"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/10498/sections/420/reviews/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "first_name": "CATRIONA", "last_name": "MACLEOD", "id": "1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "name": "CATRIONA MACLEOD"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "10498-420-1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-254", "path": "/courses/10498", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10498/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE SELF-PORTRAIT", "sectionnum": "420", "primary_alias": "GRMN-254-420", "path": "/courses/10498/sections/420", "id": "10498-420", "aliases": ["GRMN-254-420", "COLL-004-420"]}]}, "id": 10498, "aliases": ["GRMN-254", "COLL-004"]}
