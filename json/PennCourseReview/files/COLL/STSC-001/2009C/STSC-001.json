{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3970"}, "description": "During the last 500 years, science has emerged as a central and transformative force that continues to reshape everyday life in countless ways. This introductory course will survey the emergence of the scientific world view fromthe Renaissance through the end of the 20th century. By focusing on the life, work and cultural contexts of those who created modern science, we will explore their core ideas and techniques, where they came from, what problems they solved, what made them controversial and exciting and how they related to contemporary religious beliefs, politics, art, literature, and music. The course is organized chronologically and thematically. In short, this is a \"Western Civ\" course with a difference, open to students at all levels. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18126/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.62", "rDifficulty": "2.66", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.59", "rWorkRequired": "2.05", "rInstructorAccess": "2.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "2.84"}, "section": {"name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-001-401", "path": "/courses/18126/sections/401", "id": "18126-401", "aliases": ["STSC-001-401", "HSOC-001-401"]}, "comments": "This introductory course surveys the emergence of the scientific world view from the Renaissance through the end of the 20th century.

The course is organized chronologically and thematically. &#8232;\r\n&#8232;Overall, students enjoyed the content of the course but felt that the breadth of material covered was overwhelming. As one student put it, the course \u201ctries to take too much of a bite out of history.\u201d Due to the limited lecture time (two hours a week) and inaccessibility of lecture slides, many students felt rushed and unable to fully grasp the lecture material. On the other hand, some students deemed the breadth of material consistent with other introductory courses, and reported that the course provided \u201cgood cultural background for science majors.\u201d \r\n&#8232;Students described Professor Adams as a \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d lecturer. Some students wished that he was more accommodating to students\u2019 need to access course content outside of class, such as posting the lecture slides and class handouts online. One student reported that Professor Adams was \u201cinflexible\u201d about students\u2019 special circumstances, and many students disliked his emphasis on \u201cspecific dates and names, and not broader themes.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;\r\nGrading is based on two exams, five assignments, and class participation in recitation. Overall, students felt that exams focused too much on \u201crote memorization,\u201d rather than overarching concepts. Many wished that multiple smaller quizzes were given in recitation to reinforce material learned in lecture. This course has no prerequisites, and is a core requirement for the STSC Major. It also fulfills the Humanities and Social Sciences or the Natural Sciences and Mathematics sector requirements.\r\n", "num_students": 78, "path": "/courses/18126/sections/401/reviews/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "first_name": "MARK B", "last_name": "ADAMS", "id": "663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "name": "MARK B ADAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 71, "id": "18126-401-663-MARK-B-ADAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-001", "path": "/courses/18126", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18126/sections", "values": [{"name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-001-401", "path": "/courses/18126/sections/401", "id": "18126-401", "aliases": ["STSC-001-401", "HSOC-001-401"]}]}, "id": 18126, "aliases": ["STSC-001", "HSOC-001"]}
