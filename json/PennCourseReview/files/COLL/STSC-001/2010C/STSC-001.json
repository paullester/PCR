This introductory course will survey the emergence of the scientific world view fromthe Renaissance through the end of the 20th century. By focusing on the life, work and cultural contexts of those who created modern science, we will explore their core ideas and techniques, where they came from, what problems they solved, what made them controversial and exciting and how they related to contemporary religious beliefs, politics, art, literature, and music. The course is organized chronologically and thematically. In short, this is a \"Western Civ\" course with a difference, open to students at all levels. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23847/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "3.16", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.19", "rReadingsValue": "2.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-001-401", "path": "/courses/23847/sections/401", "id": "23847-401", "aliases": ["STSC-001-401", "HSOC-001-401"]}, "comments": "\r\nThis course examines the emergence and development of the scientific world-view, from the Renaissance to the end of the 20th century. Students explore the history of scientific ideas, the social contexts which gave rise to them, and their social and human implications. Sample topics include: Copernican revolution; Galileo, science and the Church; Newton and the mechanical worldview; Enlightenment and Romantic science; Lavoisier, industrialization and the rise of modern chemistry; Darwin, Darwinism and evolution; atomic physics, the bomb and its aftermath; the emergence of modern genetics; the DNA revolution; computers and the information age; and science and the human future. &#8232;\r\nStudents found the course \u201cvery interesting\u201d because of its focus on \u201cscience within a historical, social, and political context.\u201d Some students felt that the course focused too much on historical details and not enough on analyzing history. One student recommended that the class should instead focus on material \u201cI can\u2019t just Google.\u201d However, one student noted, \u201cthe primary source documents and several of the readings definitely provided the course material with more substance and depth\u201d to supplement the detail oriented lectures. Students also noted that due to the breath of the material covered, the course felt very rushed. Others thought, \u201cthis is exactly what a History of Science course at the 001 level should be.\u201d Nonetheless, students still \u201clooked [forward] to every lecture\u201d and \u201clearned a lot.\u201d&#8232;\r\n\r\n&#8232;Students enjoyed Professor Tresch, whom they called an \u201cinteresting and engaging lecturer.\u201d Professor Tresch\u2019s \u201cpassion for the subject matter is palpable.\u201d Many students noted that his lectures frequently exceeded the time limit of the class. Students also felt that Professor Tresch would occasionally move too quickly through the material, making his lectures difficult to follow. One student could not understand his speech and therefore had difficulty comprehending lecture. Overall, however, students found Professor Tresch \u201cstimulating,\u201d \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201coutstanding,\u201d and \u201camazing.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents really enjoyed the interactive portion of their class that involved taking field trips to places like the Penn Rare Books Library. The students then wrote papers about these experiences, and they expressed enthusiasm about the topics they chose for these projects. Students also enjoyed the guest lecturers featured in the class. In terms of workload, the class had \u201ca fair amount of work - not too much, not too little\u201d and the \u201cexams [were] predictable (but fair).\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 88, "path": "/courses/23847/sections/401/reviews/4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "first_name": "JOHN", "last_name": "TRESCH", "id": "4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "name": "JOHN TRESCH"}, "num_reviewers": 82, "id": "23847-401-4131-JOHN-TRESCH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-001", "path": "/courses/23847", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23847/sections", "values": [{"name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-001-401", "path": "/courses/23847/sections/401", "id": "23847-401", "aliases": ["STSC-001-401", "HSOC-001-401"]}]}, "id": 23847, "aliases": ["STSC-001", "HSOC-001"]}
