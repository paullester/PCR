This introductory course will survey the emergence of the scientific world view fromthe Renaissance through the end of the 20th century. By focusing on the life, work and cultural contexts of those who created modern science, we will explore their core ideas and techniques, where they came from, what problems they solved, what made them controversial and exciting and how they related to contemporary religious beliefs, politics, art, literature, and music. The course is organized chronologically and thematically. In short, this is a \"Western Civ\" course with a difference, open to students at all levels. \n\n", "semester": "2010B", "name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21201/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "EMERGENCE OF MODERN SCI", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "STSC-001-910", "path": "/courses/21201/sections/910", "id": "21201-910", "aliases": ["STSC-001-910", "HSOC-001-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/21201/sections/910/reviews/5265-DAMON-A--YARNELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5265-DAMON-A--YARNELL", "first_name": "DAMON A.", "last_name": "YARNELL", "id": "5265-DAMON-A--YARNELL", "name": "DAMON A.
