{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/287"}, "description": "This course is devoted to understanding how we advance knowledge and understanding over the broad range of academic disciplines. A central concern is to further understanding of how a case is \"made\" for a particular claim. The nature of \"evidence\" will be at the forefront of the course. The problem of how do you know? is explored via two-week presentations by five different faculty members, from five very different disciplines. In each module, the faculty member, using original source readings related to his or her own work, demonstrates how progress is made within his or her discipline. The course integrator, who attends all lectures, extracts common themes, provides background including a short introduction to statistics, and leads students in an exercise exploring the pathway from a scientific finding to its presentation in the media. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "HOW DO YOU KNOW?", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/287/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.19", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "1.96", "rRecommendMajor": "1.76", "rCourseQuality": "1.96", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.20", "rReadingsValue": "2.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.30"}, "section": {"name": "HOW DO YOU KNOW?", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COLL-100-001", "path": "/courses/287/sections/001", "id": "287-001", "aliases": ["COLL-100-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/287/sections/001/reviews/272-PAUL-A-HEINEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/272-PAUL-A-HEINEY", "first_name": "PAUL A", "last_name": "HEINEY", "id": "272-PAUL-A-HEINEY", "name": "PAUL A HEINEY"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "287-001-272-PAUL-A-HEINEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COLL-100", "path": "/courses/287", "sections": {"path": "/courses/287/sections", "values": [{"name": "HOW DO YOU KNOW?", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COLL-100-001", "path": "/courses/287/sections/001", "id": "287-001", "aliases": ["COLL-100-001"]}]}, "id": 287, "aliases": ["COLL-100"]}
