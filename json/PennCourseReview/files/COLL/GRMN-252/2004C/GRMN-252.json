{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2588"}, "description": "The concept of the modern \"individual\" was, as many would argue, an eighteenth century invention. This course will discuss the period of Enlightenment that gave rise to it, and follow its development until the twentieth century. Why would it be suddenly important to think of separate human beings with particular desires and needs, rather than a more uniform group of subjects? And what ar the consequences of such a move? \n\nAdopting a broad but focused historical perspective, this course will examine the ways in which the individual has been theorized, represented, and understood across various countries and disciplines. Two professors--one from German, and one from French--will provide lectures and lead discussions on the position of the individual in specific historical and cultural contexts, beginning with the French Revolution and ending with Freud and the psychoanalytic revolution. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "EMERGENCE OF INDIVIDUAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5406/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.59", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "3.07", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.78", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "EMERGENCE OF INDIVIDUAL", "sectionnum": "411", "primary_alias": "GRMN-252-411", "path": "/courses/5406/sections/411", "id": "5406-411", "aliases": ["GRMN-252-411", "COLL-004-411"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/5406/sections/411/reviews/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "first_name": "LILIANE", "last_name": "WEISSBERG", "id": "1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG", "name": "LILIANE WEISSBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "5406-411-1332-LILIANE-WEISSBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-252", "path": "/courses/5406", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5406/sections", "values": [{"name": "EMERGENCE OF INDIVIDUAL", "sectionnum": "411", "primary_alias": "GRMN-252-411", "path": "/courses/5406/sections/411", "id": "5406-411", "aliases": ["GRMN-252-411", "COLL-004-411"]}]}, "id": 5406, "aliases": ["GRMN-252", "COLL-004"]}
