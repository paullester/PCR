{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/288"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the contemporary skills, fundamental concepts, and intellectual capabilities required to make effective use of information technology in the arts and sciences. The course will be structured as a workshop in which students will complete a series of hands-on projects drawn from scholarly activities in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences at Penn. \n\nStudents' design and implementation experiences will be enhanced through seminars with guest panels, who will provide students with a broader view of real-world applications for the material covered in this class. In addition, optional tutorials will be offered outside of the regularly scheduled classes to provide students with a step-by-step introduction to the software used for the projects. No prior exposure to computing is required. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "FLUENCY/INFO TECHNOL-AS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3923/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "FLUENCY/INFO TECHNOL-AS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "COLL-110-001", "path": "/courses/3923/sections/001", "id": "3923-001", "aliases": ["COLL-110-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/3923/sections/001/reviews/273-M--CECELIA-BUCHANAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/273-M--CECELIA-BUCHANAN", "first_name": "M.
