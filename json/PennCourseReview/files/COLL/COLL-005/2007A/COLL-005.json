Along with the principal instructor, a member of the Penn faculty with special expertise in the book under discussion will attend each session (see attached syllabus). Students will be required to read each assignment with care, to attend all sessions, and to participate actively in discussion. Students will complete a brief writing assignment each week, and will also take a final exam. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "GREAT BOOKS: A SELECTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14265/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.53", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.87", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.80", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "GREAT BOOKS: A SELECTION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COLL-005-301", "path": "/courses/14265/sections/301", "id": "14265-301", "aliases": ["COLL-005-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/14265/sections/301/reviews/1409-PETER-CONN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1409-PETER-CONN", "first_name": "PETER", "last_name": "CONN", "id": "1409-PETER-CONN", "name": "PETER CONN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "14265-301-1409-PETER-CONN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COLL-005", "path": "/courses/14265", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14265/sections", "values": [{"name": "GREAT BOOKS: A SELECTION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COLL-005-301", "path": "/courses/14265/sections/301", "id": "14265-301", "aliases": ["COLL-005-301"]}]}, "id": 14265, "aliases": ["COLL-005"]}
