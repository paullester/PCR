Texts will include prose narratives (Tristan et Iseut, Manon Lescaurt, L\u2019Amant), plays (Phedre, On ne badine pas avec l\u2019amour), and poetry (by Ronsard, Hugo, Baudelaire, Apollinaire). All readings and class discussion in French.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nOne student mentioned that this course was a good introduction to French literature and literary analysis. This student also said that the readings in this course were excellent.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nA couple of students said that Professor Richman was a good instructor. One of these students said that Professor Richman was doing her very best and that the student appreciated this and that she was sympathetic. Another mentioned that the professor \u201cwas able to frame the course in such a way that made sense and each book built upon the ideas presented at the beginning of the course.\u201d However, many of the students commented that Professor Richman seemed more interested in her own views on the subject than that of the students, and expected them to regurgitate her own ideas. Many also commented that Professor Richman did not encourage class discussions or participation.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents found the workload to be fair.  Some complained that Professor Richman finished students\u2019 thoughts before they could express themselves which did not work towards helping them improve their French. \r\n", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/17408/sections/401/reviews/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "first_name": "MICHELE H.", "last_name": "RICHMAN", "id": "551-MICHELE-H--RICHMAN", "name": "MICHELE H.
