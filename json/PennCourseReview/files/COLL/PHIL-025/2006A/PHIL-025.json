The course also covers key issues in the philosophy of science including the relationship between theory and evidence, the nature of scientific explanation, and scientific realism. Readings will be drawn from the writings of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Descartes, Newton, Boyle, Dalton, Darwin, Mendeleev, and Einstein, as well as secondary sources. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "EVOL SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT: The Evolution of Scientific Thought", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8195/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "1.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "EVOL SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT: The Evolution of Scientific Thought", "sectionnum": "412", "primary_alias": "PHIL-025-412", "path": "/courses/8195/sections/412", "id": "8195-412", "aliases": ["PHIL-025-412", "COLL-002-412"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/8195/sections/412/reviews/2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "WEISBERG", "id": "2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG", "name": "MICHAEL WEISBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "8195-412-2302-MICHAEL-WEISBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-025", "path": "/courses/8195", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8195/sections", "values": [{"name": "EVOL SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT: The Evolution of Scientific Thought", "sectionnum": "412", "primary_alias": "PHIL-025-412", "path": "/courses/8195/sections/412", "id": "8195-412", "aliases": ["PHIL-025-412", "COLL-002-412"]}]}, "id": 8195, "aliases": ["PHIL-025", "COLL-002"]}
