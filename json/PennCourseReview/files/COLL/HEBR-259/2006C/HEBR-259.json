{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3401"}, "description": "\"I Want to Die in My Bed\", a young Yehuda Amichai's anti-war poem, led the rebellion of Israeli authors in the 1950's. These writers were weary of their predecessors'glorification of nationalism and sacrifice, and disillusioned by the post-war reality of statehood. They therefore rejected the ideological focus and pompous language of their literary 'fathers.' Scholars would later call them \"The Generation of the State\" because they were the first to publish in the newly-- established State of Israel and they forged the future of Hebrew literature. For instance, poets like Nathan Zach and David Avidan promoted the use of colloquial langauge, while prose authors A.B. Yehoshua and Amos Oz published individualistic, anti-heroic short stories. The class is conducted in Hebrew and all texts are read in the original. The amount of material we cover depends on the pace of the class. The packet contains significantly more material than will be studied in class to compensate for the difficulty of obtaining Hebrew texts in America. The content of this course changes from year to year, so students may take it for credit more than once. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "INTRO MODERN HEBREW LIT: Israeli Short Story: Modern & Post-modern", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9029/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO MODERN HEBREW LIT: Israeli Short Story: Modern & Post-modern", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-259-401", "path": "/courses/9029/sections/401", "id": "9029-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-259-401", "HEBR-559-401", "JWST-259-401", "COML-266-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/9029/sections/401/reviews/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "first_name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF", "last_name": "GOLD", "id": "63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF GOLD"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "9029-401-63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HEBR-259", "path": "/courses/9029", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9029/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO MODERN HEBREW LIT: Israeli Short Story: Modern & Post-modern", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-259-401", "path": "/courses/9029/sections/401", "id": "9029-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-259-401", "HEBR-559-401", "JWST-259-401", "COML-266-401"]}]}, "id": 9029, "aliases": ["HEBR-259", "HEBR-559", "JWST-259", "COML-266"]}
