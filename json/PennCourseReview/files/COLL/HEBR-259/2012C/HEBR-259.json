{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3401"}, "description": "This course concentrates on Hebrew and Israeli Short stories by both male and female authors, whose works range from traditional to post-modernist, varying in themes and artistic sensibilities. For Hebrew writers, the short story has been a favorite genre from the Renaissance of Hebrew literature in the late 19th century through the present day. The stories' subjects and style went through transformations as did the writers and audiences. The most dramatic change, however, occurred within Hebrew itself as it became a spoken, vibrant language over the decades. Drawing from the ancient wells of the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash, Hebrew authors forged a new diction for representing the inner world, psychological insight and political assertions. Using canonical texts by Brenner, Agnon, Applefeld and Oz as a backdrop, the lion's share of the course focuses on contemporary authors like Almog, Keret, Castel-Bloom and Matalon, whose diction is often simpler, but whose stories reflect the complexity of modern Israeli life. Class conducted in Hebrew. Texts read in the original language. As the content of this course changes from year to year, and therefore, students may take it for credit more than once. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRO MODERN HEBREW LIT: The First Israelis: Amichai, Oz, et al.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29067/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.10", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO MODERN HEBREW LIT: The First Israelis: Amichai, Oz, et al.", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-259-401", "path": "/courses/29067/sections/401", "id": "29067-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-259-401", "JWST-259-401", "COML-266-401", "COLL-227-401", "HEBR-559-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/29067/sections/401/reviews/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "first_name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF", "last_name": "GOLD", "id": "63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF GOLD"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "29067-401-63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HEBR-259", "path": "/courses/29067", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29067/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO MODERN HEBREW LIT: The First Israelis: Amichai, Oz, et al.", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-259-401", "path": "/courses/29067/sections/401", "id": "29067-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-259-401", "JWST-259-401", "COML-266-401", "COLL-227-401", "HEBR-559-401"]}]}, "id": 29067, "aliases": ["HEBR-259", "JWST-259", "COML-266", "COLL-227", "HEBR-559"]}
