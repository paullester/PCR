{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/117"}, "description": "Students explore the contributions of anthropology, philosophy, and community service to understanding human nature and human behavior. Within the context of globalization, we will pose basic philosophical questions about the nature of human nature, capitalism, and the forces influencing people's decisions about their own lives. Anthropological accounts (ethnographies) from Asia, Latin America, England, and the USA; excerpts from political philosophers (Rousseau, Smith, Marx, Foucault, Bourdieu, and Freire); and students' first-hand experience volunteering in West Philadelphia will help students reach their own conclusions about these and other globalization issues. Students will use their ABCS (Academically-Based Community Service) experience as an anthropology laboratory, seeing social theory as it operates \"on the ground.\" \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "CULTURE CLASH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14055/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "1.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.17"}, "section": {"name": "CULTURE CLASH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-115-301", "path": "/courses/14055/sections/301", "id": "14055-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-115-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/14055/sections/301/reviews/99-PAULA-W--SABLOFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/99-PAULA-W--SABLOFF", "first_name": "PAULA W.", "last_name": "SABLOFF", "id": "99-PAULA-W--SABLOFF", "name": "PAULA W.
