{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1653"}, "description": "This course will explore the ways that health and illness-related beliefs and behaviors develop within communities. We will identify the forces that shape these beliefs and behaviors and ultimately affect who gets sick, who gets well, and the very nature of the illness experience. Emphasis will be given to the relationships among sociocultural, political and biological factors and the ways that these factors interact to produce the variation that we see in health and illness related attitudes, behaviors and outcomes across cultures. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "CROSS CULTRL APPR HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21272/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "1.82", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.65", "rCourseQuality": "3.16", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.35", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "CROSS CULTRL APPR HEALTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-441-401", "path": "/courses/21272/sections/401", "id": "21272-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-441-401", "HSOC-441-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/21272/sections/401/reviews/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "first_name": "FRANCES K.", "last_name": "BARG", "id": "115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "name": "FRANCES K.
