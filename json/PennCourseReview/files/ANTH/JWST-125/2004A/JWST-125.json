This seminar focuses on similarities and differences between the text of the Hebrew Bible, transmitted over thousands of years, and other ancient texts discovered by archeologists in the last 150 years. The seminar will focus on reading primary sources and will make use of the Penn Museum of Archeology and Anthropology. All readings in translation; knowledge of languages other than English not required. Students will be encouraged to ask questions, and discussions will target issues students raise. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "BIBLE, ARCHEOLOGY & HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6740/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "BIBLE, ARCHEOLOGY & HIST", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "JWST-125-601", "path": "/courses/6740/sections/601", "id": "6740-601", "aliases": ["JWST-125-601", "ANTH-117-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/6740/sections/601/reviews/2045-SHAWN-Z--ASTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2045-SHAWN-Z--ASTER", "first_name": "SHAWN Z.", "last_name": "ASTER", "id": "2045-SHAWN-Z--ASTER", "name": "SHAWN Z.
