{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/120"}, "description": "The relationship between the activities of native peoples and the environment is a complex and contentious issue. One perspective argues that native peoples had little impact on the environments because of their low population densities, limited technology, and conservation ethic and worldview. At other extreme, biodiversity, and nature itself, is considered the product of a long history of human activities. This seminar will examine the myth of the ecologically noble savage, the myth of the pristine environment, the alliance between native peoples and green politics, and the contribution of native peoples to appropriate technology, sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "NATIVE PEOPLES & ENVIRON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/120/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "NATIVE PEOPLES & ENVIRON", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-133-401", "path": "/courses/120/sections/401", "id": "120-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-133-401", "LTAM-133-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/120/sections/401/reviews/102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON", "first_name": "CLARK LOWDEN", "last_name": "ERICKSON", "id": "102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON", "name": "CLARK LOWDEN ERICKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "120-401-102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-133", "path": "/courses/120", "sections": {"path": "/courses/120/sections", "values": [{"name": "NATIVE PEOPLES & ENVIRON", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-133-401", "path": "/courses/120/sections/401", "id": "120-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-133-401", "LTAM-133-401"]}]}, "id": 120, "aliases": ["ANTH-133", "LTAM-133"]}
