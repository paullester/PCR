{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4012"}, "description": "This course is a general overview of the important components of social research. The first third of the semester presents a conceptual basis for assessing research quality based on the four \"types of validity.\" We also cover the standard elements of research design including sampling, measurement, and causal inference. These concepts are then illustrated through reviews of four research areas: surveys and field studies, qualitative/ethnographic studies, content analysis, and policy/evaluation studies. The last third of the semester focuses more on descriptive and inferential statistics, measures of association for categorical and continuous variables, and the language of data analysis. For these classes, we make use of SMALL STATA, a PC program useful for learning statistics. Most modules are illustrated through class exercises based on published articles. This course fulfills the undergraduate quantitative requirement. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "Quantitative Research Methods in Communication", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28758/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.16", "rCourseQuality": "2.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "1.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.85", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "Quantitative Research Methods in Communication", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-210-301", "path": "/courses/28758/sections/301", "id": "28758-301", "aliases": ["COMM-210-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/28758/sections/301/reviews/3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY", "first_name": "AMY", "last_name": "BLEAKLEY", "id": "3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY", "name": "AMY BLEAKLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "28758-301-3250-AMY-BLEAKLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-210", "path": "/courses/28758", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28758/sections", "values": [{"name": "Quantitative Research Methods in Communication", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "COMM-210-301", "path": "/courses/28758/sections/301", "id": "28758-301", "aliases": ["COMM-210-301"]}]}, "id": 28758, "aliases": ["COMM-210"]}
