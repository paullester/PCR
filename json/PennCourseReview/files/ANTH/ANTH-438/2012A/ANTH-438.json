{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5367"}, "description": "How do people make choices that affect their health? How do people understand and respond to the ever changing nature of danger in their environment? How do people act/react when they are faced with imminent threats to their health? In this course, we will examine the construct of risk and the roles that risk perception and uncertainty play in health-related decision making. We will differentiate among anthropological, psychological, and epidemiologic approaches to understanding risk. Students will have an opportunity explore in more depth the ways that the notion of risk figures in decisions related to genetics, lifestyle choices and environmental health. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ANTH RISK PERCEP IN HLTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26959/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.84", "rDifficulty": "1.74", "rStimulateInterest": "2.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.37", "rCourseQuality": "2.84", "rWorkRequired": "1.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "3.21", "rInstructorQuality": "2.95"}, "section": {"name": "ANTH RISK PERCEP IN HLTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-438-401", "path": "/courses/26959/sections/401", "id": "26959-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-438-401", "HSOC-488-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/26959/sections/401/reviews/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "first_name": "FRANCES K.", "last_name": "BARG", "id": "115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "name": "FRANCES K.
