{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5072"}, "description": "This course is developed in conjuntion with the Philadelphia Zoo to collect locomotion and ranging behaviors in captive primate species. In addition to data collection, the students are responsible for the statistical analysis of the data. The outcome of this project is the practical application to a new Philadelphia Zoo initiative to move the primates from stationary enclosures to a pattern of more free-ranging space utilization (called \"raceways\") within the confines of the Zoo. Students will participate in a wide range of lectures/discussions and instructional experiences including many from the curatorial staff of the Primates; be responsible for the collection of data (6 hours of observation per week) at the Zoo; and work with the Zoo staff to analyze the data. The focus is on primate movement, positional behaviors, locomotor plasticity and anatomy. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PRIMATE BEH & LOCOMOTION: Primate Behavior and Locomotion", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22634/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "PRIMATE BEH & LOCOMOTION: Primate Behavior and Locomotion", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-517-301", "path": "/courses/22634/sections/301", "id": "22634-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-517-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/22634/sections/301/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
