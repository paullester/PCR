{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4782"}, "description": "Skilled sailors and merchants or heartless baby killers? Both have been claimed in the ancient accounts for this mysterious people living along the levantine coast. The Phoenicians were a literate culture and they spread the use of the alphabet far and wide, but little of what they wrote survives. Thus, the story passed down to us comes almost entirely from their enemies and rivals. In this course we attempt to understand the Phoenicians by analyzing their achaeological remains in concert with contemporary and later textual accounts. We will delve into Phoenician cities, shipwrecks, artifacts and inscriptions looking at the culture from its humble early beginnings through to its intense colonization of the Mediterranean that was eventually stamped out by the Romans. We will thus analyze Canaanite, Phoenician and Punic life through their crafts, their architecture, their business and their politics. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "WHO WERE THE PHOENICIANS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19757/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "WHO WERE THE PHOENICIANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-509-401", "path": "/courses/19757/sections/401", "id": "19757-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-509-401", "ANTH-126-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/19757/sections/401/reviews/2397-WILLIAM-B-HAFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2397-WILLIAM-B-HAFFORD", "first_name": "WILLIAM B", "last_name": "HAFFORD", "id": "2397-WILLIAM-B-HAFFORD", "name": "WILLIAM B HAFFORD"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "19757-401-2397-WILLIAM-B-HAFFORD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-509", "path": "/courses/19757", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19757/sections", "values": [{"name": "WHO WERE THE PHOENICIANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-509-401", "path": "/courses/19757/sections/401", "id": "19757-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-509-401", "ANTH-126-401"]}]}, "id": 19757, "aliases": ["ANTH-509", "ANTH-126"]}
