{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/125"}, "description": "What makes Indian democracy unique in the modern world? Who are the major and minor institutional and non-institutional players within contemporary Indian politics? What are the key forms and everyday practices that constitute the worlds largest and most vibrant democracy? When and how did these develop, and how do they differ from democratic forms elsewhere in the world? This course will focus on the political organizations, mobilizations, and actors in 20th century India that have played a decisive role in establishing and uniquely shaping Indian electoral politics. We will pay close attention to the role of individual leaders and charismatic figures, including key women and minority leaders, and trace the development of dynasties within electoral politics. The course will also examine the role of public space as a forum for some of the distinctive practices that have most defined Indian politics, including bandhs (strikes), rasta rokos (road closures), processions, and other non-violent and sometimes violent forms of action. We will identify the ideological role of Gandhian principles, including ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (passive resistance), in establishing popular forms of political practice that continue to be widely utilized in contemporary Indian politics. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "WITCHCRAFT IN MDRN WRLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/125/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.92", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "WITCHCRAFT IN MDRN WRLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-166-001", "path": "/courses/125/sections/001", "id": "125-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-166-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/125/sections/001/reviews/107-MATTHEW-A--TOMLINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/107-MATTHEW-A--TOMLINSON", "first_name": "MATTHEW A.", "last_name": "TOMLINSON", "id": "107-MATTHEW-A--TOMLINSON", "name": "MATTHEW A.
