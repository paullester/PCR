{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5611"}, "description": "This course examines methods and theories for the archaeological study of ancient economies. First we will review different anthropological approaches to the study of the subject including modernist, formalist, substantivist and culturalist models. Second we will consider economic processes and their formation in ancient civilizations, and discuss how these relate to political and social change. Third, we will address key themes in the study of ancient economy such as craft production and exchange, state finance, urban economy and regional systems. The course gives a comparative account of ancient economic structures and development through a number of case studies. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29853/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-431-401", "path": "/courses/29853/sections/401", "id": "29853-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-431-401", "NELC-486-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/29853/sections/401/reviews/6446-SALAM-AL-KUNTAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6446-SALAM-AL-KUNTAR", "first_name": "SALAM", "last_name": "AL KUNTAR", "id": "6446-SALAM-AL-KUNTAR", "name": "SALAM AL KUNTAR"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "29853-401-6446-SALAM-AL-KUNTAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-431", "path": "/courses/29853", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29853/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF ANCIENT ECONOMIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-431-401", "path": "/courses/29853/sections/401", "id": "29853-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-431-401", "NELC-486-401"]}]}, "id": 29853, "aliases": ["ANTH-431", "NELC-486"]}
