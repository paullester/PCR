{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3277"}, "description": "On the surface, domestic and factory workers appear to perform radically different tasks. However, if we explore the conditions surrounding their employment, we see that globally, women in these occupations share some very important characteristics. These include similar household status, similar economic motivation and financial goals, and, similar placement on the occupational ladder. Many domestic and factory workers are also migrants, and although they are often better educated than women of previous generations, the vast majority are underemployed. This course examines how new forms of production and the spread of global capitalism have impacted the lives of women. The course will also examine and critique previous and current theoretical constructs that have attempted to describe and explain the phenomenon. By also evaluating women in relation to their country or region of origin, we will compare how global economic, social, and political forces have created new and renewed forms of womens oppression. Through group projects and individual projects, we will research and evaluate the conditions of women engaged in domestic and factory labor, and look at how past, present and future global conditions affect women associated with and employed in these categories of work. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "GLOBAL WOMEN'S LABOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8512/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBAL WOMEN'S LABOR", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-449-601", "path": "/courses/8512/sections/601", "id": "8512-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-449-601", "WSTD-449-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/8512/sections/601/reviews/2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "first_name": "MARILYNNE", "last_name": "DIGGS-THOMPSON", "id": "2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "name": "MARILYNNE DIGGS-THOMPSON"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "8512-601-2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-449", "path": "/courses/8512", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8512/sections", "values": [{"name": "GLOBAL WOMEN'S LABOR", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-449-601", "path": "/courses/8512/sections/601", "id": "8512-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-449-601", "WSTD-449-601"]}]}, "id": 8512, "aliases": ["ANTH-449", "WSTD-449"]}
