{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5357"}, "description": "The course will focus on the social history of the body, widely conceived, in early Indian society. Doctrines of the body will be placed against the context of wider traditions of thinking about ethics and selfhood and viewed in both cultural and historical contexts. Themes will include the evolution of religious doctrines and rituals, the history of emotions and interpersonal relations, the evolution of state and society, and urban and rural cultures. Specific topics treated will include theories of physiology, health, and illness; gesture and movement; sartorial codes, sumptuary regulations, and 'body culture'; gender and sexuality; and the representation of the body in art and literature. In addition to contextual and thematic readings, the course will expose students to a wide variety of primary sources (translated from Sanskrit, Pali and Tamil),including religious and ritual texts courtly literature, art (painting, sculpture, material culture), as well as well as inscriptions and normative treatises. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "BODY,POWER,SOC EARLY IND: Body, Power, Society in Early India", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26750/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.57", "rCourseQuality": "1.88", "rWorkRequired": "1.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "BODY,POWER,SOC EARLY IND: Body, Power, Society in Early India", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-288-401", "path": "/courses/26750/sections/401", "id": "26750-401", "aliases": ["SAST-288-401", "ANTH-289-401", "RELS-260-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/26750/sections/401/reviews/4975-DAUD-ALI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4975-DAUD-ALI", "first_name": "DAUD", "last_name": "ALI", "id": "4975-DAUD-ALI", "name": "DAUD ALI"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "26750-401-4975-DAUD-ALI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-288", "path": "/courses/26750", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26750/sections", "values": [{"name": "BODY,POWER,SOC EARLY IND: Body, Power, Society in Early India", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-288-401", "path": "/courses/26750/sections/401", "id": "26750-401", "aliases": ["SAST-288-401", "ANTH-289-401", "RELS-260-401"]}]}, "id": 26750, "aliases": ["SAST-288", "ANTH-289", "RELS-260"]}
