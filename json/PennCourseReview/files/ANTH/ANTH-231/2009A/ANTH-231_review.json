The goal is to think of the movies as significant cultural artifacts that we use to make sense of the world rather than as just forms of entertainment or art. Through a study of popular American films and their related merchandise and cultural influences, we will also see how anthropology can be used to study contemporary cultures.\r\n\r\nStudents appreciated that this course tested new academic boundaries by requiring video assignments and consideration of graphic and visual materials\u2014like comic books\u2014as serious academic matters. However, they also found many serious problems with the course execution. Most heartily disapproved of the readings required for the course, calling them \u201ccompletely ridiculous in length and subject matter.\u201d One student even described the tone of the readings as \u201cbombastically filibustering,\u201d and criticized the professor for giving such a \u201claundry list\u201d of readings that had not been filtered for actual content.\r\n\r\nStudents agreed that while Professor Krasniewicz was a \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cextremely interesting\u201d person, she was \u201cnot a very good teacher.\u201d One student noted that, \u201cthe class is full of interesting content, but is marred by an instructor who has not yet mastered how to teach it.\u201d Several students noted that her practice cold-calling during lecture was unpleasant since \u201cyou had to be inside her head in order to answer questions correctly\u201d and that the correct answer was often \u201carbitrary.\u201d Moreover, she provided \u201cambiguous answers\u201d to students\u2019 questions in class. Almost all students noted that her expectations about assignments were also ambiguous, leading to unnecessary stress over the class. Her help outside of class was limited, although one student noted that she improved her responsiveness to students at the close of the term.\r\n\r\nProficiency with a computer, and particular software programs, was practically necessary for success in the class. Without it, the course becomes \u201cnearly unmanageable\u201d in the words of one student. \u201cThe professor expects a level of knowledge of video editing software that is inappropriate for a course with no prerequisites or requirement of video editing skills stated in the syllabus,\u201d another said.", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/15318/sections/401/reviews/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "first_name": "LOUISE", "last_name": "KRASNIEWICZ", "id": "2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "name": "LOUISE KRASNIEWICZ"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "15318-401-2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ"}]
