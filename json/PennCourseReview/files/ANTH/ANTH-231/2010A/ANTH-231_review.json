The goal is to think of the movies as significant cultural artifacts that we use to make sense of the world rather than as just forms of entertainment or art. Through a study of popular American films and their related merchandise and cultural influences, students also see how anthropology can be used to study contemporary cultures.\r\nStudents were for the most part neutral towards the content of the course. One student commented that the course was \u201cvery fluffy in nature\u201d and another described it as \u201ceasy and entertaining.\u201d However, several students objected to the large amount of time spent on the final video project.\r\nProfessor Krasniewicz received mostly negative reviews. Several students felt that her expectations were unclear and that she was \u201cimpossible to approach.\u201d In class discussions, one student said that she \u201cdoes not compromise and refuses to alter her views on the subject.\u201d Many claimed that she did not provide adequate technological assistance throughout the final assignment\u2014according to one, she was \u201cunhelpful and refused to give advice on a project fraught with tons of complications.\u201d\r\nOverall, although students did not believe the class to be difficult, they were reluctant to recommend the course to those not incredibly interested in the topic.", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/25593/sections/401/reviews/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "first_name": "LOUISE", "last_name": "KRASNIEWICZ", "id": "2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "name": "LOUISE KRASNIEWICZ"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "25593-401-2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ"}]
