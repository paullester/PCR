{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4781"}, "description": "Modern business corporations can be characterized as having their own internal cultures, more or less distinct from one another. They also exist within encompassing cultures and cultural flows. At the same time, corporations are producers and disseminators, and thus have effects on their surrounding environments, effects that extend from the local to the global. This course examines modern corporations from these three perspectives through theoretical and ethnographic readings, guest speakers from the corporate world, and independent research conducted by the students. Course requirements include student presentations of their research and readings; one or more take-home exams; and a final research paper. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ANTH OF CORPORATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26954/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.79", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.84", "rCommAbility": "3.21", "rInstructorQuality": "3.26"}, "section": {"name": "ANTH OF CORPORATIONS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-347-301", "path": "/courses/26954/sections/301", "id": "26954-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-347-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/26954/sections/301/reviews/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "first_name": "GREGORY P.", "last_name": "URBAN", "id": "267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "name": "GREGORY P.
