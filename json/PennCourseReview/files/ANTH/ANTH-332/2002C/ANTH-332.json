{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1648"}, "description": "Anthropology has a long-lasting engagement with international human rights discourse, often focusing on how human rights are experienced across different cultures and religions, and how inequalities of power and resources affect whose ideas of human rights are turned into law and common standards. In spite of criticism of the idea of universal human rights from anthropology and a host of other perspectives, we nonetheless have today an ostensibly global 'human rights culture'. In this course, we will examine the debates surrounding the idea of universal human rights, and also draw upon anthropological and legal sources in seeking to understand this human rights culture: how and why it is produced, disseminated, and continually re-interpreted and its role in asserting the legitimacy of governments and building national communities. Using concrete examples from Argentina, Rwanda, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Singapore, former Yugoslavia, the halls of the UN, and other areas where human rights are asserted, violated, and negotiated, we will explore topics such as state terror, genocide, rights to culture, indigenous peoples, peace keepers refugees, environmental rights, discrimination, and globalization. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "CULTURE & HUMAN RIGHTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2614/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "CULTURE & HUMAN RIGHTS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-332-301", "path": "/courses/2614/sections/301", "id": "2614-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-332-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/2614/sections/301/reviews/1256-IVAR-N-HULTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1256-IVAR-N-HULTIN", "first_name": "IVAR N", "last_name": "HULTIN", "id": "1256-IVAR-N-HULTIN", "name": "IVAR N HULTIN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "2614-301-1256-IVAR-N-HULTIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-332", "path": "/courses/2614", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2614/sections", "values": [{"name": "CULTURE & HUMAN RIGHTS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-332-301", "path": "/courses/2614/sections/301", "id": "2614-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-332-301"]}]}, "id": 2614, "aliases": ["ANTH-332"]}
