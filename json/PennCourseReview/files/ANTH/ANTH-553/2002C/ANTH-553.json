{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1659"}, "description": "In this course, the political systems of a wide spectrum of world societies, and theories about these systems, are analyzed and compared from an anthropological perspective. Materials range from classic studies of non-Western governmental institutions to contemporary ethnographic accounts of global political forms. Stress is placed on the problematics of power, such as the ritual construction of political relations, the art of governance, or the dynamics of dominance and resistance. Emphasis also is given to the pragmatics of political action, such as the ways people engage with the \"state,\" produce and voice public opinion, or react to violence. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "CULTR, PWR & POLI PRACT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2625/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.42", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58"}, "section": {"name": "CULTR, PWR & POLI PRACT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-553-301", "path": "/courses/2625/sections/301", "id": "2625-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-553-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/2625/sections/301/reviews/96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES", "first_name": "SANDRA THEIS", "last_name": "BARNES", "id": "96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES", "name": "SANDRA THEIS BARNES"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "2625-301-96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-553", "path": "/courses/2625", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2625/sections", "values": [{"name": "CULTR, PWR & POLI PRACT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-553-301", "path": "/courses/2625/sections/301", "id": "2625-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-553-301"]}]}, "id": 2625, "aliases": ["ANTH-553"]}
