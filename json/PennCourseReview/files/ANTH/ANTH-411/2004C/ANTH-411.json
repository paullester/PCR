{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1651"}, "description": "This course surveys psychoanalytic and social theories of sex and gender. We begin with the social organization and construction of sexual expression and engendered subjectivity. The social ordering of power through the mechanisms of sexual behavior and engendered subjectivity is considered next. In addition to reading anthropological analyses of sex and gender in specific ethnographic contexts, students will become familiar with relevant theorists such as Belsey, Strathern, de Lauretis, Foucault, Freud and Lacan. Short papers will be assigned in which students apply specific theories to interpret case material. Advanced undergraduates and graduate students are welcome. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "ANTHRO OF SEX AND GENDER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4970/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-411", "path": "/courses/4970", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4970/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANTHRO OF SEX AND GENDER", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-411-401", "path": "/courses/4970/sections/401", "id": "4970-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-411-401", "WSTD-511-401"]}]}, "id": 4970, "aliases": ["ANTH-411", "WSTD-511"]}
