{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3860"}, "description": "What can anthropological theory and practice add to contemporary analyses of mass media - television, radio, film and the Internet? What does it mean to think about the cultural implications of mass media offerings, to conceptualize media practices, products, and practitioners as emphatically cultural phenomena? Anthropologists provide a very specific corrective to conventional understandings of mass media, pinning much of their intellectual significance on the fact that they reconfigure academic debates about media \"texts,\" championing research methods and theoretical arguments that provide very specific contextual frameworks for rethinking mass media's social and cultural value. This course will allow students to identify and critique the anthropological approach to media studies - unpacking its larger implications, determining its most and least convincing claims. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "ANTHROPOLOGY AND MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13071/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.35", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.74", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "2.93", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "ANTHROPOLOGY AND MEDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-314-401", "path": "/courses/13071/sections/401", "id": "13071-401", "aliases": ["COMM-314-401", "ANTH-315-401"]}, "comments": "Students generally felt that Professor Jackson did a very good job with this class, with many students noting he worked to make sure students really understood the material and developed useful thinking skills.", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/13071/sections/401/reviews/3923-JOHN-L--JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3923-JOHN-L--JACKSON", "first_name": "JOHN L.", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "3923-JOHN-L--JACKSON", "name": "JOHN L.
