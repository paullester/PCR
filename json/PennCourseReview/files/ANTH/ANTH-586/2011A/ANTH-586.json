As even the most mundane purchase becomes socially symbolic and culturally meaningful we can persuasively argue that the concept of \"need\" has been transformed. Analyzing a variety of physical and virtual consumer venues, the goal of htis seminar is to understand and to analyze historical and contemporary issues related to a culture of consumption. We investigate social and political-economic factors that impact when and how people purchase goods and argue that behavior attached to consumption includes a nexus of influences that may change periodically in response to external factors. Readings and research assignments are interdisciplinary and require a critical analyses of global/local linkages. The city of Philadelphia becomes the seminar's laboratory as we ask how have issues of culture, consumption, and global capitalism become intertwined around the world? \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21275/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "ANTH-586-640", "path": "/courses/21275/sections/640", "id": "21275-640", "aliases": ["ANTH-586-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/21275/sections/640/reviews/2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "first_name": "MARILYNNE", "last_name": "DIGGS-THOMPSON", "id": "2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "name": "MARILYNNE DIGGS-THOMPSON"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "21275-640-2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-586", "path": "/courses/21275", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21275/sections", "values": [{"name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "ANTH-586-640", "path": "/courses/21275/sections/640", "id": "21275-640", "aliases": ["ANTH-586-640"]}]}, "id": 21275, "aliases": ["ANTH-586"]}
