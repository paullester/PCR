The course begins by covering the fundamental principles of evolutionary theory and some of the basics of genetics and heredity as they relate to human morphological, physiological, and genetic variation. It also examines what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past, reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. The course concludes by examining the \\\"hard\\\" evidence of human evolution.\r\nThis sector requirement course was described as \u201can excellent overview of anatomical evolution from greater apes to humans.\u201d Some students complained that it \u201cfocused too much on paleontology and fossil evidence and not enough on the theory of evolution,\u201d but also said that it would able to appeal to all types of students. Students enjoyed the field trip required saying it was \u201cvery helpful in explaining the course material from a different point of view.\u201d One of the most prevalent complaints was that recitations were unorganized and poorly run. Several people also commented that the lecture slides were confusing and not useful.\r\nStudents liked Professor Fernandez-Duque saying he presented complicated information in a way that was interesting and easily understood. One student described him as \u201ca great professor who understands the academic pressure students face.\u201d\r\nThis course fills a Living World sector requirement. There are two midterms and one final exam. Most people agreed that the exam questions were very specific. \u201cI spent hours and hours studying but still found the multiple choice questions difficult,\u201d said one student.", "num_students": 135, "path": "/courses/15305/sections/001/reviews/2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "first_name": "EDUARDO", "last_name": "FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "id": "2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "name": "EDUARDO FERNANDEZ-DUQUE"}, "num_reviewers": 126, "id": "15305-001-2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.19", "rRecommendMajor": "3.35", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "1.96", "rInstructorAccess": "3.16", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO HUMAN EVOLUTION", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-003-601", "path": "/courses/15305/sections/601", "id": "15305-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-003-601"]}, "comments": "This course focuses on the scientific study of human evolution describing the emergence,\r\ndevelopment, and diversification of our species, Homo sapiens.
