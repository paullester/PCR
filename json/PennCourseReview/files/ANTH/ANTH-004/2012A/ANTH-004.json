{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1194"}, "description": "An introduction to the diversity of cultures in the world. This course is divided into two parts. The first briefly examines different models of understanding human diversity: ethnicities, religions, languages, political forms, economic structures, cultures, and \"civilizations\". Students will learn to think about the world as an interconnected whole, and know the significance of culture on a global scale. The second part is an introduction to area studies, in which we undertake a survey of the different regions of theworld. We conduct the survey paying attention to the different aspects of human diversities, which we examine in the first part of this course. Students will acquire a greater appreciation and understanding of cultural differences in the more comprehensive social context. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "MDRN WRLD-CLTRL BKGND: The Modern World and its Cultural Background", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26940/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.41", "rDifficulty": "1.98", "rStimulateInterest": "2.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.09", "rCourseQuality": "2.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.19", "rInstructorAccess": "2.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "2.99", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "MDRN WRLD-CLTRL BKGND: The Modern World and its Cultural Background", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-004-001", "path": "/courses/26940/sections/001", "id": "26940-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-004-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 174, "path": "/courses/26940/sections/001/reviews/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "first_name": "GREGORY P.", "last_name": "URBAN", "id": "267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "name": "GREGORY P.
