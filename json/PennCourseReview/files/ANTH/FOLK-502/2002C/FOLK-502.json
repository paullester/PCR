{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1845"}, "description": "This graduate seminar explores the theory and practice of folkloristic ethnography, with a focus on sites in West Philadelphia. Through reading and exercises in ethnographic observation and writing, students consider the natureof the enthnographic encounter, its social functions and civic possibilities, and the writings, archives, films, recordings and community events that form its outcomes. Historical and contemporary reading provide an overview of ethnography as it has emerged in the social sciences over the past century, while attention to the techniques and technologies in fieldnotes, sound and video recording, photography, archiving, and sensing will develop students' skills as ethnographic scholars, writers, and community activists. Undergraduates may enroll with permission. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "FIELDWORK THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2987/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "3.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "FIELDWORK THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FOLK-502-401", "path": "/courses/2987/sections/401", "id": "2987-401", "aliases": ["FOLK-502-401", "WSTD-502-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/2987/sections/401/reviews/1441-MARY-T--HUFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1441-MARY-T--HUFFORD", "first_name": "MARY T.", "last_name": "HUFFORD", "id": "1441-MARY-T--HUFFORD", "name": "MARY T.
