{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2969"}, "description": "While it has traditionally studied the expressive behaviors of many other cultures around the globe, American anthropology has rarely used the tools of cultural analysis to look at its own mass-market Hollywood movies. This course will apply textual and contextual analysis, cross-cultural comparisons, mythological and symbolic approaches, and cognitive, linguistic and discourse analysis to look at the form, content and effects of popular movies. The last segment of the course will focus on the work of one filmmaker who seems to train an anthropological eye on the culture through his/her films. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ANTHROPOLOGY AND CINEMA: Anthropology and the Cinema", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14071/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.05", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "3.05", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.37", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "ANTHROPOLOGY AND CINEMA: Anthropology and the Cinema", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-336-401", "path": "/courses/14071/sections/401", "id": "14071-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-336-401", "CINE-336-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/14071/sections/401/reviews/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "first_name": "LOUISE", "last_name": "KRASNIEWICZ", "id": "2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "name": "LOUISE KRASNIEWICZ"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "14071-401-2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-336", "path": "/courses/14071", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14071/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANTHROPOLOGY AND CINEMA: Anthropology and the Cinema", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-336-401", "path": "/courses/14071/sections/401", "id": "14071-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-336-401", "CINE-336-401"]}]}, "id": 14071, "aliases": ["ANTH-336", "CINE-336"]}
