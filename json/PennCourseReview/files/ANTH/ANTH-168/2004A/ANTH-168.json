{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2722"}, "description": "Without question, genetic research is making a profound impact on the modern world. It has led to many new and exciting insights in the field of biological anthropology, particularly those subareas concerned with human origins and biological diversity, and is having an equally important influence on the biomedical sciences. Furthermore, through the use of new genetic technologies, the entire human genome has been recently sequenced, giving us an opportunity to better understand the nature of human development, disease and biological variation at the molecular level. This course will explore the new findings in biological anthropology resulting from the use of these genetic methods, as well as examine the social and political implications of these advances. Among the topics to be covered in the course are the Human Genome Project, genetic testing in forensic and criminal cases, race and biological variation, genetic engineering, the genetic basis of disease, and modern human origins. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "GENETICS & MODERN WORLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6146/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "2.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "1.69", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "2.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "GENETICS & MODERN WORLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-168-001", "path": "/courses/6146/sections/001", "id": "6146-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-168-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/6146/sections/001/reviews/112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR", "first_name": "THEODORE GEORGE", "last_name": "SCHURR", "id": "112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR", "name": "THEODORE GEORGE SCHURR"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "6146-001-112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-168", "path": "/courses/6146", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6146/sections", "values": [{"name": "GENETICS & MODERN WORLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-168-001", "path": "/courses/6146/sections/001", "id": "6146-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-168-001"]}]}, "id": 6146, "aliases": ["ANTH-168"]}
