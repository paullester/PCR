{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5393"}, "description": "Archaeology is a young and exciting scientific discipline created around 150 years ago as a way to discover and interpret the material remains of our human past. Many archaeological sites are world-famous: Pompeii, Troy, the pyramids of Egypt, the Parthenon of Athens, the Taj Mahal, and the temple complex at Angkor Wat, to name a few. In this course, we will examine many important archaeological sites in the \"Old World\" of the Mediterranean, Near East, and Asia. Using a thematic and comparative approach, we will delve deeper to explore the societies that produced these wonders, and examine cultural similarities and differences across the Old World. This course is a non-technical introduction for students interested in archaeology, history, art history, anthropology, or related subjects. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "GREAT DISCOV ARCHAEOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30084/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.81", "rTAQuality": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "1.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.16"}, "section": {"name": "GREAT DISCOV ARCHAEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-123-401", "path": "/courses/30084/sections/401", "id": "30084-401", "aliases": ["CLST-123-401", "ANTH-127-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/30084/sections/401/reviews/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "first_name": "THOMAS F.", "last_name": "TARTARON", "id": "3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "name": "THOMAS F.
