{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5393"}, "description": "Archaeology is a young and exciting scientific discipline created around 150 years ago as a way to discover and interpret the material remains of our human past. Many archaeological sites are world-famous: Pompeii, Troy, the pyramids of Egypt, the Parthenon of Athens, the Taj Mahal, and the temple complex at Angkor Wat, to name a few. In this course, we will examine many important archaeological sites in the \"Old World\" of the Mediterranean, Near East, and Asia. Using a thematic and comparative approach, we will delve deeper to explore the societies that produced these wonders, and examine cultural similarities and differences across the Old World. This course is a non-technical introduction for students interested in archaeology, history, art history, anthropology, or related subjects. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Great Discoveries in Archaeology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27186/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.93", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "1.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "Great Discoveries in Archaeology", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-123-401", "path": "/courses/27186/sections/401", "id": "27186-401", "aliases": ["CLST-123-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/27186/sections/401/reviews/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "first_name": "THOMAS F.", "last_name": "TARTARON", "id": "3210-THOMAS-F--TARTARON", "name": "THOMAS F.
