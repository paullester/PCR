{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3276"}, "description": "All humans belong to communities that provide identity, a sense of place, and tools for interpreting the world. Yet communities are also a source of tension and conflict. This course will look at this dual role of communities in American culture. The course will look at the accidental communities that we are born into, the ones that result from a shared language, or the ones that happen where we live with our families. There are also planned communities that deliberately try to form residents' identities: the former Panama Canal Zone, women's anti-war protest groups, turn of the century religious groups on the Jersey Shore, post WWII suburban planned communities in the east, the proposed Ave Maria Catholic city in Florida, the nuclear bomb communities in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the ultimate constructed community: Las Vegas, Nevada. The last third of the course will investigate the possibility of community in virtual worlds. Do Internet communities, including blogging, on-line gaming, and online gambling, provide their members with the same social and cultural tools that on-the-ground communities do? Can they even be called communities or do we need new ways of defining these social interactions? \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "Communities: Planned, Accidental & Virtual", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8510/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "Communities: Planned, Accidental & Virtual", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-322-301", "path": "/courses/8510/sections/301", "id": "8510-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-322-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/8510/sections/301/reviews/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "first_name": "LOUISE", "last_name": "KRASNIEWICZ", "id": "2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "name": "LOUISE KRASNIEWICZ"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "8510-301-2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-322", "path": "/courses/8510", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8510/sections", "values": [{"name": "Communities: Planned, Accidental & Virtual", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-322-301", "path": "/courses/8510/sections/301", "id": "8510-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-322-301"]}]}, "id": 8510, "aliases": ["ANTH-322"]}
