{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2724"}, "description": "This seminar is an introduction to Indigenous archaeologies. These approaches have been defined as archaeology \"with, for and by Indigenous peoples.\" However, they are in fact more than this. Not only do they seek to make archeaology more representative of and responsible to Indigenous communities. They also seek to contribute to a more accurate understanding of the archaelogical record through the incorporation of Native epistemologies. This course covers such topics as the history of American archaeology, indigenous knowledge and cultural values, NAGPRA, museumification, decolonizing methodologies, and current debates. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21259/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-223-301", "path": "/courses/21259/sections/301", "id": "21259-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-223-301", "ANTH-523-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/21259/sections/301/reviews/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "PREUCEL", "id": "108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "name": "ROBERT W.
