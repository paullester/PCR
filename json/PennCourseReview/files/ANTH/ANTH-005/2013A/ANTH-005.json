{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5364"}, "description": "This course explores the history and archaeology of the last 20,000 years from the development of agriculture to the industrial revolution. Why did people across the world abandon foraging for farming? How and why did cities and states develop? Why did societies succeed or fail? How have humans transformed themselves and the natural world, including the landscape and the climate? We will explore the methods that archaeologists use to consider these questions and analyze evidence for social and economic change from the Middle East, the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe. In addition, students will have a chance to conduct hands-on exercises with artifacts from the Penn Museum and an opportunity to do some experimental archaeology during recitations. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "GREAT TRANSFORMATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29833/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.32", "rTAQuality": "3.09", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rCourseQuality": "2.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorQuality": "2.93", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.64"}, "section": {"name": "GREAT TRANSFORMATIONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-005-001", "path": "/courses/29833/sections/001", "id": "29833-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-005-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/29833/sections/001/reviews/4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "first_name": "LAUREN M.", "last_name": "RISTVET", "id": "4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "name": "LAUREN M.
