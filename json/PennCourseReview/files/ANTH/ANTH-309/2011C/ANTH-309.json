The class will also look to the future, endeavoring to examine as well such issues as the role of computers (are they self objects?) and the internet (including such online games as \"second Life\"), dreams in space alien abduction narratives, sexuality in advertising, political psychology, and other contemporary issues. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "PSYCHOANALYSIS & ANTHRO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23977/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.85", "rRecommendMajor": "2.86", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.07"}, "section": {"name": "PSYCHOANALYSIS & ANTHRO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-309-401", "path": "/courses/23977/sections/401", "id": "23977-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-309-401", "ANTH-519-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/23977/sections/401/reviews/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "first_name": "GREGORY P.", "last_name": "URBAN", "id": "267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "name": "GREGORY P.
