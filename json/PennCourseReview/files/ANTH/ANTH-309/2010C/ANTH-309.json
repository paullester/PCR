{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5071"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the rich literature that has grown up around the encounter between psychoanalysis and anthropology, from totem and taboo, to studies of the Oedipus complex, child-rearing practices, ritual symbolism, mythology, and dreams. The class will also look to the future, endeavoring to examine as well such issues as the role of computers (are they self objects?) and the internet (including such online games as \"second Life\"), dreams in space alien abduction narratives, sexuality in advertising, political psychology, and other contemporary issues. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PSYCHOANALYSIS & ANTHRO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22629/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.83", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "PSYCHOANALYSIS & ANTHRO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-309-401", "path": "/courses/22629/sections/401", "id": "22629-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-309-401", "ANTH-519-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/22629/sections/401/reviews/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "first_name": "GREGORY P.", "last_name": "URBAN", "id": "267-GREGORY-P--URBAN", "name": "GREGORY P.
