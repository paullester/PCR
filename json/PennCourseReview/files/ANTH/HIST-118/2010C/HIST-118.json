{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5123"}, "description": "This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms, or of such close cousins as demonology, sorcery, exorcism, magic, and the witches Sabbath, raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs, patterns of accusation, the general social position of victims, the intensity and timing of witch hunts, and its relation to religious practice, law, language, gender, social marginalization, and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist, The Blair Witch Project, The Crucible, and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "WITCHCRAFT & POSSESSION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23210/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.03", "rDifficulty": "1.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.28", "rRecommendMajor": "2.36", "rCourseQuality": "2.20", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.21", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "2.44", "rInstructorQuality": "2.66"}, "section": {"name": "WITCHCRAFT & POSSESSION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-118-401", "path": "/courses/23210/sections/401", "id": "23210-401", "aliases": ["HIST-118-401", "GSOC-119-401", "ANTH-118-401", "RELS-109-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/23210/sections/401/reviews/639-ROBERT-B--ST-GEORGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/639-ROBERT-B--ST-GEORGE", "first_name": "ROBERT B.", "last_name": "ST.GEORGE", "id": "639-ROBERT-B--ST-GEORGE", "name": "ROBERT B.
