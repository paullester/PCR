{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1652"}, "description": "This ABCS course focuses on the design and implementation of a syllabus for an experimental course on the peoples of the world to be taught to high school students at University City High School beginning in the Fall of 2002. The course will be coordinated by two teachers at UCHS in conjunction with Peggy Reeves Sanday of the Anthropology Department. Penn students taking the course will participate in all phases of curriculum development. Selected students will act as student teachers of the high school course which will be tested in the Fall. Other students will coordinate materials and help prepare class sessions. Anthropology students who have taken the basic intro courses in anthropology and have an interest in putting their knowledge to work are encouraged to enroll. Students from other social science disciplines or from the humanities with a background in world cultures are also welcome. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "WORLD CULTURES AT UCHS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2618/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-425", "path": "/courses/2618", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2618/sections", "values": [{"name": "WORLD CULTURES AT UCHS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-425-301", "path": "/courses/2618/sections/301", "id": "2618-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-425-301"]}]}, "id": 2618, "aliases": ["ANTH-425"]}
