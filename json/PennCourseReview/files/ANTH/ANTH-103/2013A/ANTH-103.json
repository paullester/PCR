{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4507"}, "description": "Empires have been an enduring phenomenon for more than 4,000 years, from the rise of Akkad in Mesopotamia to the American invasion in Iraq. How and why do empires emerge? How do empires work? Why do empires endure (or collapse)? This class will study the origins, structures and consequences of imperialism by comparing ancient and modern empires from all over the world. In addition to a study of the political aspects of imperialism, we will analyze the cultural and economic facets of imperialism, particularly acculturation, cultural hybridity and issues of identity. We will analyze a wide-range of data, including art and artifacts from the Penn Museum, administrative and historical records, novels and films. Empires covered may include Egypt, Assyria, Achaemenid Persia, Rome, Han China, Sassanian Persia, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Mongols, Mughal india, Mali, Inka, Aztec, Spain, Ottoman, France and America. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "EMPIRES: AKKAD TO AMER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29836/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "EMPIRES: AKKAD TO AMER", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-103-301", "path": "/courses/29836/sections/301", "id": "29836-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-103-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/29836/sections/301/reviews/4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "first_name": "LAUREN M.", "last_name": "RISTVET", "id": "4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "name": "LAUREN M.
