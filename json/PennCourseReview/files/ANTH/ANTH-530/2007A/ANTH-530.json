What kind of intellectual practices are possible, and what kind of methodological innovations are needed under the sway of contemporary social conditions and their unpredictable outcomes? This seminar engages key theoretical frameworks and conceptsglobalization, the public sphere, risk society, networks, citizenship, structural violence, and ethicsthat inform the way many anthropologists think and write about social formations and human experiences today. How do these frameworks and concepts shape anthropological observation and critique? How theoretically productive can ethnography be? In charting how societies and cultures are being theorized and debated today, we reflect onethnographic practice as it is modeled within and against other forms of scientific, political, and humanistic inquiry, and explore its stakes and connections to these endeavors. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "THRY IN CONTEMP ETHNOGRA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14078/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "3.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "THRY IN CONTEMP ETHNOGRA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-530-301", "path": "/courses/14078/sections/301", "id": "14078-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-530-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/14078/sections/301/reviews/4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA", "first_name": "ADRIANA", "last_name": "PETRYNA", "id": "4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA", "name": "ADRIANA PETRYNA"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "14078-301-4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-530", "path": "/courses/14078", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14078/sections", "values": [{"name": "THRY IN CONTEMP ETHNOGRA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-530-301", "path": "/courses/14078/sections/301", "id": "14078-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-530-301"]}]}, "id": 14078, "aliases": ["ANTH-530"]}
