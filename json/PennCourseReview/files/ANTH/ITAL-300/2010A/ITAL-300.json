Specifically, this course investigates how food factors into textual genres such as narrative, poetry, cinema, visual arts, and advertising. \r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201cfun,\u201d \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cenjoy[able],\u201d and \u201ceasy.\u201d Other students commented that it was a \u201cgreat course.\u201d Another student described it as \u201cthe perfect class to take as an elective.\u201d Students reported learning a lot from this course; one student commented that this course led to \u201cenlighten[ment] on [Italian] food\u201d while another stated that this course allowed students to \u201clearn a lot about food and its role in not only Italian culture, but also various cultures throughout the world.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Finotti was described as rather disorganized, although students thought he was \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cengaging.\u201d Another student said that Finotti was a \u201cgreat teacher\u201d and said that he, along with the TAs, was very easy to contact for help. Many students also found that the TAs were very helpful and \u201camazing,\u201d although grading policies were questioned, especially the consistency between TAs. \r\n\r\nSome students found that the course was difficult because the \u201crequirements and\u2026 guidelines were not very clear,\u201d while others explained that this was due to the disorganization of the course. The student assessment of this class\u2019s difficulty varied from reviewer to reviewer. Some found the course to be \u201creally tough\u201d while others commented that it was \u201ceasy overall.\u201d Specific critiques on the intensity of the course centered around the group work, which was often difficult because some students \u201cdid not seem to take the course very seriously\u201d and required film editing skills that the course did not teach, and therefore students thought the final project was very work intensive but \u201coffered little regard in terms of learning.\u201d The vast difference in apparent difficulty may be attributed to the amount a student is willing to work; some students noted that the class had a \u201cserious free-loader issue\u201d while others said the class was \u201cvery easy.\u201d One student commented that certain TAs were easier graders and therefore it can be expected that this class leads to fairly high grades. Assignments include readings, class attendance, preparation, participation, oral responses, and a final oral presentation. The course is taught in English, and many students commented that it is not only directed towards students interested in Italian studies.\r\n", "num_students": 177, "path": "/courses/26257/sections/401/reviews/1877-FABIO-FINOTTI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1877-FABIO-FINOTTI", "first_name": "FABIO", "last_name": "FINOTTI", "id": "1877-FABIO-FINOTTI", "name": "FABIO FINOTTI"}, "num_reviewers": 168, "id": "26257-401-1877-FABIO-FINOTTI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-300", "path": "/courses/26257", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26257/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS: ITALIAN CULTURE: MIGRATIONS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-300-301", "path": "/courses/26257/sections/301", "id": "26257-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-300-301", "COML-300-301"]}, {"name": "TOPICS: ITALIAN CULTURE: FOOD & CULTURE OF ITALY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-300-401", "path": "/courses/26257/sections/401", "id": "26257-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-300-401", "COML-300-401"]}]}, "id": 26257, "aliases": ["ITAL-300", "COML-300"]}
