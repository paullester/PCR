{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/122"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the ways in which the arts are a part of healing performances in a variety of sociocultural contexts. Students will explore how the arts are employed in the diagnosis of disease, facilitate the creative expression of the illness experience, and motivate healing through self-transformational processes. The course is divided into three sections. In the first part of the course, we will develop an analytic framework for conceptualizing and comparing healing performances from diverse ethnographic settings. In the second part of the course, we will read from a selection of ethnographic which describe how music, drama, narrative, art and dance are used as healing modalities. In the third segment, will investigate the expanding role of the arts in bio settings in the United States, using students' ethnographic research as our data source. Ethnographic films and presentations by guest speakers who incorporate the arts in therapeutic practice will complement the lectures and reading materials. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "ARTS IN HEALING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19742/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "ARTS IN HEALING", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-140-601", "path": "/courses/19742/sections/601", "id": "19742-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-140-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/19742/sections/601/reviews/104-SERAN-E-SCHUG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/104-SERAN-E-SCHUG", "first_name": "SERAN E", "last_name": "SCHUG", "id": "104-SERAN-E-SCHUG", "name": "SERAN E SCHUG"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "19742-601-104-SERAN-E-SCHUG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-140", "path": "/courses/19742", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19742/sections", "values": [{"name": "ARTS IN HEALING", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-140-601", "path": "/courses/19742/sections/601", "id": "19742-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-140-601"]}]}, "id": 19742, "aliases": ["ANTH-140"]}
