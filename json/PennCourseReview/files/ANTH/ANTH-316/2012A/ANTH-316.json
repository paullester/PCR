{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4885"}, "description": "This course explores the theoretical and ethnographic approaches to the diverse forms of labor in the world. Course discussions will begin by examining how the historical process of industrialization created the modern concepts of time and the ideal industrial workers. Later we will investigate how local communities and individuals react to the changes caused by rapidly globalizing capitalism. By reading ethnographic writings about the various workplaces in capitalist and post-socialist countries, students can understand how the existing \"culture\" of the people has affected their reactions to the incessant changes. Course topics include both domestic and international cases. About the domestic workplaces, we will look into the daily lives of MBA job holders in New York Manhattan, part-time restaurant workers in the Midwest, and Mexican migrant workers in the Deep South. About the international workplaces, we will investigate Japanese white-collar workers' reaction to the call of globalization, Colombian tin miners' survival strategies to the fluctuating international market price of tin ore, Chinese workers' understanding of their sweatshop jobs, Indian women workers' view about their jobs in a global call center; origins of \"corporate culture\" and its local applications in South Korea. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ANTH OF GLOBAL LABOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26953/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "ANTH OF GLOBAL LABOR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-316-301", "path": "/courses/26953/sections/301", "id": "26953-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-316-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/26953/sections/301/reviews/4238-JAESOK-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4238-JAESOK-KIM", "first_name": "JAESOK", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "4238-JAESOK-KIM", "name": "JAESOK KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "26953-301-4238-JAESOK-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-316", "path": "/courses/26953", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26953/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANTH OF GLOBAL LABOR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-316-301", "path": "/courses/26953/sections/301", "id": "26953-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-316-301"]}]}, "id": 26953, "aliases": ["ANTH-316"]}
