{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5698"}, "description": "Come learn about the birth of Christianity, the Ottoman Empire, the Trojan War, and some of the world's earliest villages. This Freshman Seminar will explore both the ancient archaeology and contemporary history of Turkey. Often simplified as a bridge between East and West, we will instead examine the role played by the past in the formation of a modern nation-state. In other words, what is the relationship between the ancient and the present of this Middle Eastern country? Themes such as Turkish nationalism, secularism and Islam, Turkey's ethnic minorities, modernization and traditions, will guide our lectures, discussions and readings throughout the semester. As we evaluate the impact of history and archaeology on contemporary Turkish culture and identity, students will read across the social sciences, incorporating literature, cinema, music, and food, in order to complement their classroom experience with a lived awareness of the country. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "TURKEY - PAST & PRESENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30713/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "TURKEY - PAST & PRESENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-020-401", "path": "/courses/30713/sections/401", "id": "30713-401", "aliases": ["NELC-020-401", "ANTH-020-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/30713/sections/401/reviews/6535-LAURENT-DISSARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6535-LAURENT-DISSARD", "first_name": "LAURENT", "last_name": "DISSARD", "id": "6535-LAURENT-DISSARD", "name": "LAURENT DISSARD"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "30713-401-6535-LAURENT-DISSARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-020", "path": "/courses/30713", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30713/sections", "values": [{"name": "TURKEY - PAST & PRESENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-020-401", "path": "/courses/30713/sections/401", "id": "30713-401", "aliases": ["NELC-020-401", "ANTH-020-401"]}]}, "id": 30713, "aliases": ["NELC-020", "ANTH-020"]}
