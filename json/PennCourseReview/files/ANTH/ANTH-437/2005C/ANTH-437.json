{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2217"}, "description": "There is a great deal of variation among population groups in the incidence of and mortality from most major diseases. Biological and social factors can account for some of this variation. However, there is increasing evidence that behavior- and the cultural models that are linked to health behavior- play an important role, too. Cognitive anthropology is the study of how people in social groups conceive of objects and events in their world. It provides a framework for understanding how members of different groups categorize illness and treatment. It also helps to explain why risk perception, help-seeking behavior, and decision-making styles vary to the extent they do. This seminar will explore the history of cognitive anthropology, schema theory, connectionism, the role of cultural models, and factors affecting health decision making. Methods for identifying cultural models will be discussed and practiced. Implications for health communication will be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "CULTURAL MODELS & HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11411/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.96", "rDifficulty": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "2.81", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58", "rReadingsValue": "2.96", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.04", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "CULTURAL MODELS & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-437-401", "path": "/courses/11411/sections/401", "id": "11411-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-437-401", "HSOC-437-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/11411/sections/401/reviews/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "first_name": "FRANCES K.", "last_name": "BARG", "id": "115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "name": "FRANCES K.
