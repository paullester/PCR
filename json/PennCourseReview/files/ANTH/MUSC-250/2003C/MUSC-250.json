{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2349"}, "description": "This course explores various methodological problems and theoretical constructs that confront us during the course of ethnomusicological fieldwork. How can we approach writing about our ethnographic work without silencing the voices of those who should be heard? In what ways might transcription and notation complicate power structures and reinforce our own musical values? What special challenges need to be negotiated in the process of documenting ethnographies on film? How do ethical and economic dilemmas inform our approach to making sound recording? A series of readings in ethnomusicology and anthropology will suggest some answers to these questions--answers that will, in turn, be tested by means of several interconnected fieldwork projects focused on gospel music in West Philadelphia. Our readings and fieldwork experiences will shape our classroom discussions, leading not only to be a better understanding of ethnomusicological methods, but also to a deeper appreciation of the \"shadows\" that we cast in the field. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "FLD METH IN ETHNO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4450/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-250", "path": "/courses/4450", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4450/sections", "values": [{"name": "FLD METH IN ETHNO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-250-401", "path": "/courses/4450/sections/401", "id": "4450-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-250-401", "ANTH-657-401", "ANTH-257-401", "MUSC-650-401", "FOLK-255-401"]}]}, "id": 4450, "aliases": ["MUSC-250", "ANTH-657", "ANTH-257", "MUSC-650", "FOLK-255"]}
