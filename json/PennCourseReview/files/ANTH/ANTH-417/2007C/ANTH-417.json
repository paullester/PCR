{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3822"}, "description": "In this course, we will explore the history of native Siberian peoples from the initial human settlement of the region to their present day struggles for autonomy with the government of the Russian Federation. To do so, we will draw upon material from archeology, ecology, ethnography, genetics, history, human biology, linguistics, political science and sociology. This multidisciplinary approach will provide us with the broadest view on the origin and diversity of aboriginal Siberian groups, as well as insights into their historical interactions with Russians over the past four centuries. In the process, we will also examine some of the theoretical perspectives on ethnicity and nationalism held by Russian and Soviet social scientists. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "NATIVE SIBERIAN HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12859/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "NATIVE SIBERIAN HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-417-301", "path": "/courses/12859/sections/301", "id": "12859-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-417-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/12859/sections/301/reviews/112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR", "first_name": "THEODORE GEORGE", "last_name": "SCHURR", "id": "112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR", "name": "THEODORE GEORGE SCHURR"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "12859-301-112-THEODORE-GEORGE-SCHURR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-417", "path": "/courses/12859", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12859/sections", "values": [{"name": "NATIVE SIBERIAN HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-417-301", "path": "/courses/12859/sections/301", "id": "12859-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-417-301"]}]}, "id": 12859, "aliases": ["ANTH-417"]}
