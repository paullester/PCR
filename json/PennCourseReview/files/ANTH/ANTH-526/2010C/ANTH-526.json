{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5073"}, "description": "This is an advanced seminar for graduate and undergraduate students interested in analyzing datasets in biological anthropology and related fields. Students will work on their own datasets, which they would have collected during the previous academic year or during the summer. We will meet to discuss and work on data organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and dissemination. Feedback from the class on each individual project will be an important aspect of this course, which will finish with a final oral presentation (professional meeting style) open to the department. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "DTA ANLSYS&PRS BIO ANTH: Data Analysis and Presentation in Biological Anthropology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22635/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "DTA ANLSYS&PRS BIO ANTH: Data Analysis and Presentation in Biological Anthropology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-526-301", "path": "/courses/22635/sections/301", "id": "22635-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-526-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/22635/sections/301/reviews/2849-CLAUDIA-R--VALEGGIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2849-CLAUDIA-R--VALEGGIA", "first_name": "CLAUDIA R.", "last_name": "VALEGGIA", "id": "2849-CLAUDIA-R--VALEGGIA", "name": "CLAUDIA R.
