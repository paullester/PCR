{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5731"}, "description": "This course introduces students to Islam in modern South Asia, with a particular focus on the development of 'new' Muslim religious idioms, orientations, pedagogies and movements in 19th and 20th century South Asia. This course is divided into three parts. In the first part of this course, students are provided with an overview of: Muslim institutions and spaces in pre-colonial South Asia, the historical emergence of South Asia as a prominent global center of Islam, and the development of Urdu as an Islamic idiom. The second and main part of this course introduces students to academic literature concerning sophisticated encounters between the Muslim elite in north India and modern political and technological developments. The intimate interactions of the 'Mullah' and the 'Englishman' from the 19th to 20th century will thus be revealed to students. This part focuses upon, on the one hand, the role of Islam and pious Muslims in the colonial army, and on the other hand, Muslim initiatives to educate an Islamic 'modernism', 'traditionalism', 'fundamentalism' and 'Sufism', and appropriate print technologies for the creation of public spheres. Students will be introduced to historical scholarship revelatory of how these Muslim pedagogies and print initiatives were based upon sophisticated transcultural networks and exchange. \n\nIn the third part of this course, students will be encouraged to engage with contemporary literature on South Asian Muslim political philosophy and nationalism, and the transcultural intellectual exchanges that produced key Muslim political ideologies. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MUSLM POLTCS MDRN S.ASIA: Muslim Politics in Modern South Asia", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30987/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "MUSLM POLTCS MDRN S.ASIA: Muslim Politics in Modern South Asia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-189-401", "path": "/courses/30987/sections/401", "id": "30987-401", "aliases": ["SAST-189-401", "ANTH-189-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/30987/sections/401/reviews/5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN", "first_name": "RAMYA", "last_name": "SREENIVASAN", "id": "5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN", "name": "RAMYA SREENIVASAN"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "30987-401-5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-189", "path": "/courses/30987", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30987/sections", "values": [{"name": "MUSLM POLTCS MDRN S.ASIA: Muslim Politics in Modern South Asia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-189-401", "path": "/courses/30987/sections/401", "id": "30987-401", "aliases": ["SAST-189-401", "ANTH-189-401"]}]}, "id": 30987, "aliases": ["SAST-189", "ANTH-189"]}
