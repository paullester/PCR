{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/129"}, "description": "This course surveys the relationship between human societies and their natural environment. How are the adaptations of humans different than those of other animals? Do human societies create the environments in which they live? Or are human societies merely a reflection of natural resources and geography? Can humans regulate their economies, social organization and religion to establish a sustainable adaptation to the environment? Is the human future one of change or one of doom? After an introduction to the aims and methods of the field, we will grapple with these issues using some classic case studies in cultural ecology. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "INTRO CULTURAL ECOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/129/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.22", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO CULTURAL ECOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-245-001", "path": "/courses/129/sections/001", "id": "129-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-245-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/129/sections/001/reviews/111-KATHARINE-MOORE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/111-KATHARINE-MOORE", "first_name": "KATHARINE", "last_name": "MOORE", "id": "111-KATHARINE-MOORE", "name": "KATHARINE MOORE"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "129-001-111-KATHARINE-MOORE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-245", "path": "/courses/129", "sections": {"path": "/courses/129/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO CULTURAL ECOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-245-001", "path": "/courses/129/sections/001", "id": "129-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-245-001"]}]}, "id": 129, "aliases": ["ANTH-245"]}
