{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2215"}, "description": "Ethnohistory is a multi-disciplinary form of ethnographic study and documentary research that employs both anthropological and historical approaches. This course examines the foundations of the ethnohistorical method as a means to interpret cross-cultural colonial interactions and conflicts, and to better understand the complex histories of Native American Indian peoples from Pennsylvania and northward and eastward. Students will develop skills and strategies for interpreting and contextualizing primary and secondary source materials, oral traditions, colonial records, historical maps, and material culture. Hands-on study will include visits to local archives and historical sites to view relevant documents and landscapes. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3769/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-308-401", "path": "/courses/3769/sections/401", "id": "3769-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-308-401", "JWST-308-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/3769/sections/401/reviews/2053-JACK-KUGELMASS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2053-JACK-KUGELMASS", "first_name": "JACK", "last_name": "KUGELMASS", "id": "2053-JACK-KUGELMASS", "name": "JACK KUGELMASS"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "3769-401-2053-JACK-KUGELMASS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-308", "path": "/courses/3769", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3769/sections", "values": [{"name": "JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-308-401", "path": "/courses/3769/sections/401", "id": "3769-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-308-401", "JWST-308-401"]}]}, "id": 3769, "aliases": ["ANTH-308", "JWST-308"]}
