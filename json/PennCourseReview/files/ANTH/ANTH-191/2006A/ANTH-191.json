{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2965"}, "description": "This course examines the movement of peoples across borders. We focus on national borders in particular and, more specifically, migration to the U.S. The investigation itself will be framed by theories of society, social membership, and social change including the way that migration and other \"flows\" have challenged these theories. We will consider the role of media (music, internet, films, etc.), globalization, and religion. Attention will be given to South Asian origin populations with contrasts drawn vis-a-vis comparable immigrant populations in the U.S. (e.g. Latin-American/Latino groups) and perhaps elsewhere. Requirements include papers, class presentations, and one exam. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "MIGRATION & MULTICULT US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7302/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MIGRATION & MULTICULT US", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-191-301", "path": "/courses/7302/sections/301", "id": "7302-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-191-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/7302/sections/301/reviews/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "first_name": "GAUTAM", "last_name": "GHOSH", "id": "88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "name": "GAUTAM GHOSH"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "7302-301-88-GAUTAM-GHOSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-191", "path": "/courses/7302", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7302/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIGRATION & MULTICULT US", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-191-301", "path": "/courses/7302/sections/301", "id": "7302-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-191-301"]}]}, "id": 7302, "aliases": ["ANTH-191"]}
