{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2963"}, "description": "The course examines the diversity of the living primates, as well as their behavior and evolution. We will look at the ways in which individuals compete with one another to survive, mate and rear their offspring and how their behavior interacts with ecological factors to produce the sorts of societies that we see among primates. We will also consider how our understanding of living primates can help us reconstruct the evolution of human behavior. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "PRIMATE BEHAV & HUM EVOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7300/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "PRIMATE BEHAV & HUM EVOL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-170-301", "path": "/courses/7300/sections/301", "id": "7300-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-170-301", "ANTH-507-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/7300/sections/301/reviews/2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "first_name": "EDUARDO", "last_name": "FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "id": "2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "name": "EDUARDO FERNANDEZ-DUQUE"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "7300-301-2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-170", "path": "/courses/7300", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7300/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRIMATE BEHAV & HUM EVOL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-170-301", "path": "/courses/7300/sections/301", "id": "7300-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-170-301", "ANTH-507-301"]}]}, "id": 7300, "aliases": ["ANTH-170", "ANTH-507"]}
