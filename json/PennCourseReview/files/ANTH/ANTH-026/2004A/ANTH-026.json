{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2721"}, "description": "This seminar will examine religious transformation as both a personal experience and a socio-historical force. We will consider the ways in which conversion experiences have been narrated by those who experience them, those who incite them (e.g. missionaries), and those who seek to analyze and explain them (e.g. historians and social scientists). We will study the close historical relation between conquest and conversion, while also examining how conversions of the colonized have led to conversions of the colonizers and their cultures as well. Finally, we will examine cases in which conversion might be understood as an act of dissent and consider the liberatory possibilities of such transformations. Throughout the seminar, we will focus on what the process of conversion can teach us about human subjecthood, identity, cultural contact, and historical change. Readings will include autobiographical accounts, novels, and scholarly works by authors such as Chinua Achebe, Bartolom? de Las Casas, Jonathan Edwards, Clifford Geertz, Robin Horton, William James, C. S. Lewis, Vicente Rafael, Sojourner Truth, Gauri Viswanathan, and Malcolm X. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "POL&POET, RELIG CONV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6136/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "POL&POET, RELIG CONV", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-026-301", "path": "/courses/6136/sections/301", "id": "6136-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-026-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/6136/sections/301/reviews/2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY", "first_name": "KATHERINE", "last_name": "RAMSEY", "id": "2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY", "name": "KATHERINE RAMSEY"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "6136-301-2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-026", "path": "/courses/6136", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6136/sections", "values": [{"name": "POL&POET, RELIG CONV", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-026-301", "path": "/courses/6136/sections/301", "id": "6136-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-026-301"]}]}, "id": 6136, "aliases": ["ANTH-026"]}
