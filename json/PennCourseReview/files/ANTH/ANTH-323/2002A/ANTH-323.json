{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/136"}, "description": "The course examines various meanings of \"development\" in Modern South Asia (mostly India). It will be guided by three questions: i) what is development? ii) what are the \"pros\" and \"cons\" of development? iii) what are the mechanisms of development (i.e., who is empowered to \"enact\" it)? We will consider the complex and changing interrelationships between \"development,\" on the one hand, and \"civilization,\" \"nation,\" \"(post)colonialism,\" \"modernization\" and \"globalization\" on the other. An emphasis will be placed on Anthropological and theoretical approaches to these issues. Preparation for and participation in class is essential. The writing requirements will include an original research paper. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "DEVELOP DEBATE IN S.ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/136/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.70", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "DEVELOP DEBATE IN S.ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-323-401", "path": "/courses/136/sections/401", "id": "136-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-323-401", "SARS-323-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/136/sections/401/reviews/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "first_name": "GAUTAM", "last_name": "GHOSH", "id": "88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "name": "GAUTAM GHOSH"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "136-401-88-GAUTAM-GHOSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-323", "path": "/courses/136", "sections": {"path": "/courses/136/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEVELOP DEBATE IN S.ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-323-401", "path": "/courses/136/sections/401", "id": "136-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-323-401", "SARS-323-401"]}]}, "id": 136, "aliases": ["ANTH-323", "SARS-323"]}
