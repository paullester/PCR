{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/140"}, "description": "Archaeologists want to interpret traces of past behavior, but we cannot observe the past ourselves. How, then can we confirm our images of the past? Archaeologists have used the ethnographic record and collected their own field observations on the social, economic, and technological organization of traditional societies. Ethnoarchaeology has become a major avenue linking observations of the present and the unknown past. This course will cover the development of ethnoarchaeology, its major substantive contributions, and the critiques that have been offered of it. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/140/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "3.18", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.55", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-428-301", "path": "/courses/140/sections/301", "id": "140-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-428-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/140/sections/301/reviews/111-KATHARINE-MOORE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/111-KATHARINE-MOORE", "first_name": "KATHARINE", "last_name": "MOORE", "id": "111-KATHARINE-MOORE", "name": "KATHARINE MOORE"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "140-301-111-KATHARINE-MOORE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-428", "path": "/courses/140", "sections": {"path": "/courses/140/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-428-301", "path": "/courses/140/sections/301", "id": "140-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-428-301"]}]}, "id": 140, "aliases": ["ANTH-428"]}
