{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/135"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to health and to theories of participatory action research. This combined theoretical perspective will then be put into practice using West Philadelphia community schools as a case study. Students will become involved in design and implementation of health-related projects at an urban elementary or middle school. As one of the course requirements, students will be expected to produce a detailed research proposal for future implementation. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "HLTH IN URBN COMMUNITIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18269/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "HLTH IN URBN COMMUNITIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-312-401", "path": "/courses/18269/sections/401", "id": "18269-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-312-401", "HSOC-321-401", "URBS-312-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/18269/sections/401/reviews/116-FRANCIS-E-JOHNSTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/116-FRANCIS-E-JOHNSTON", "first_name": "FRANCIS E", "last_name": "JOHNSTON", "id": "116-FRANCIS-E-JOHNSTON", "name": "FRANCIS E JOHNSTON"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "18269-401-116-FRANCIS-E-JOHNSTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-312", "path": "/courses/18269", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18269/sections", "values": [{"name": "HLTH IN URBN COMMUNITIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-312-401", "path": "/courses/18269/sections/401", "id": "18269-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-312-401", "HSOC-321-401", "URBS-312-401"]}]}, "id": 18269, "aliases": ["ANTH-312", "HSOC-321", "URBS-312"]}
