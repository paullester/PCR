Discussion is centered around particular case studies and ethnographic examples. Examination of communicative practices in terms of the types of expressive signs they employ, their capacity to formulate and transmit cultural beliefs and ideals (such as conceptions of politics, nature, and self), and to define the size and characteristics of groups and communities sharing such ideals. Discussion of the role of media, social institutions, and technologies of communication (print, electronic). Emphasis on contemporary communicative practices and the forms of culture that emerge in the modern world. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "COMMUNICATION & CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28518/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.76", "rTAQuality": "3.59", "rStimulateInterest": "2.16", "rCourseQuality": "2.30", "rWorkRequired": "1.68", "rInstructorQuality": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33"}, "section": {"name": "COMMUNICATION & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-123-401", "path": "/courses/28518/sections/401", "id": "28518-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-123-401", "COMM-110-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/28518/sections/401/reviews/1250-ASIF-AGHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1250-ASIF-AGHA", "first_name": "ASIF", "last_name": "AGHA", "id": "1250-ASIF-AGHA", "name": "ASIF AGHA"}, "num_reviewers": 48, "id": "28518-401-1250-ASIF-AGHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-123", "path": "/courses/28518", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28518/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMMUNICATION & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-123-401", "path": "/courses/28518/sections/401", "id": "28518-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-123-401", "COMM-110-401"]}]}, "id": 28518, "aliases": ["ANTH-123", "COMM-110"]}
