{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5543"}, "description": "How do we read, record, and write histories and practices of sexual difference --in the archives, on Tumblr, or in a dyke bar? This seminar examines the links between queer politics and method. We will ask how differences in sexuality are understood and described in sexuality studies, anthropology, literature, and cultural texts. We will also consider counter archives, ephemeralobjects, live performance, and subcultural scenes in the making of queer knowledge. How might emphasizing practices, not identities, modify our understanding of representation, evidence, and interpretation? In our search for unrecognized and intangible modes of evidence, we will necessarily ask what a body and its difference might be beyond easily legible forms of subjectivity. We will also experiment with video, blogging, co-teaching and diverse forms of research and writing. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "METHDS:SEXUALITY STUDIES: Critical Methods in Sexuality Studies", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29043/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorQuality": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "METHDS:SEXUALITY STUDIES: Critical Methods in Sexuality Studies", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GSWS-244-401", "path": "/courses/29043/sections/401", "id": "29043-401", "aliases": ["GSWS-244-401", "HSOC-289-401", "ANTH-243-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/29043/sections/401/reviews/6287-JEANNE-VACCARO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6287-JEANNE-VACCARO", "first_name": "JEANNE", "last_name": "VACCARO", "id": "6287-JEANNE-VACCARO", "name": "JEANNE VACCARO"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "29043-401-6287-JEANNE-VACCARO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSWS-244", "path": "/courses/29043", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29043/sections", "values": [{"name": "METHDS:SEXUALITY STUDIES: Critical Methods in Sexuality Studies", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GSWS-244-401", "path": "/courses/29043/sections/401", "id": "29043-401", "aliases": ["GSWS-244-401", "HSOC-289-401", "ANTH-243-401"]}]}, "id": 29043, "aliases": ["GSWS-244", "HSOC-289", "ANTH-243"]}
