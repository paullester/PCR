{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1637"}, "description": "Selected international conflicts will be analyzed from a cultural point of view. This exercise will have the following advantages, each of which will be emphasized throughout the course: (a) students will study a series of internationally important situations from a distinctive academic point of view; (b) they will explore the analytical value of the concept of culture with the rigour with which it has been developed in anthropology, but in application to material not commonly treated by anthropologists, and (c) since anthropologists have difficulty comprehending and analyzing conflict within a cultural framework, they will at the same time be engaging in a theoretically experimental exercise by addressing questions concerning the relationship between conflict and cultural process. The course should be useful both to prospective anthropology majors and all undergraduates interested in the modern world, and will ideally attract students with a wide variety of interests. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "CULTR&CONFLCT INT'L RELA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2600/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.10", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "1.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "2.10", "rInstructorQuality": "2.20"}, "section": {"name": "CULTR&CONFLCT INT'L RELA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-136-301", "path": "/courses/2600/sections/301", "id": "2600-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-136-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/2600/sections/301/reviews/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "first_name": "BRIAN J", "last_name": "SPOONER", "id": "89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "name": "BRIAN J SPOONER"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "2600-301-89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-136", "path": "/courses/2600", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2600/sections", "values": [{"name": "CULTR&CONFLCT INT'L RELA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-136-301", "path": "/courses/2600/sections/301", "id": "2600-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-136-301"]}]}, "id": 2600, "aliases": ["ANTH-136"]}
