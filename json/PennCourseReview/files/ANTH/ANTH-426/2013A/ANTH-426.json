{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5610"}, "description": "In this course, we examine three types of relationships between anthropology and public health. Anthropology and public health will examine complementary and competing concepts fundamental to each discipline and ways that these concepts make it essential and difficult for the disciplines to work together. Anthropology on public health takes a critical look at assumptions in public health praxis. Anthropology in public health will focus on ways that anthropology theory and methods inform the practice of public health. Using these three approaches, we will examine topics in public health such as mental health, health promotion/disease prevention communication, cancer disparities, reproductive health, violence and infectious disease. Students will learn and apply anthropologic research methods to these problems. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ANTHRO & PUBLIC HEALTH: Anthropology and Public Health", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29852/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "2.31", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.58"}, "section": {"name": "ANTHRO & PUBLIC HEALTH: Anthropology and Public Health", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-426-401", "path": "/courses/29852/sections/401", "id": "29852-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-426-401", "HSOC-426-401", "PUBH-526-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/29852/sections/401/reviews/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "first_name": "FRANCES K.", "last_name": "BARG", "id": "115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "name": "FRANCES K.
