{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1644"}, "description": "This course will explore the role played by disease in human evolution, from the emergence of the human lineage to the present day. We will evaluate both infectious and non-infectious diseases, and examine the way in which populations and disease organisms have co-evolved. Related issues to be explored include the nature of the virulence and pathogenicity of infectious agents, and the impact of vaccination on pathogen evolution. In addition, we will discuss the epidemiological transition and the rise of complex diseases of modernization (e.g., diabetes, cancer) that has occurred in the past several centuries. Overall, the course will provide a broader understanding of the influence of disease processes on the evolution of the human species. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4965/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "1.95", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "1.91", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.41", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-244-001", "path": "/courses/4965/sections/001", "id": "4965-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-244-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/4965/sections/001/reviews/90-P--THOMAS-SCHOENEMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/90-P--THOMAS-SCHOENEMANN", "first_name": "P.
