{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1211"}, "description": "The topic in the coming term is identity. \"Identity,\" according to AFC Wallace, \"may be considered any image, or set of images (conscious or unconscious), which an individual has of himself or herself\". The full set of images of self refers to many aspects of the person on a number levels of generality: \"his or her\" wishes and desires, strengths and capabilities, vulnerabilities and weaknesses, past experiences, moral qualities, social status and roles, physical appearance, sexual orientation, ethnic, religious, or group identification and much else. Our task in this course is to examine the ways people develop and deploy their social and personal identity over the course of their lives under conditions of a culturally constituted conception of self. Cross-cultural materials we will consider include films, autobiographical writings, personal observations, and life history representations. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3771/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.41", "rDifficulty": "1.94", "rStimulateInterest": "2.47", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.06", "rReadingsValue": "2.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.35", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-341-301", "path": "/courses/3771/sections/301", "id": "3771-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-341-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/3771/sections/301/reviews/109-MELVYN-HAMMARBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/109-MELVYN-HAMMARBERG", "first_name": "MELVYN", "last_name": "HAMMARBERG", "id": "109-MELVYN-HAMMARBERG", "name": "MELVYN HAMMARBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "3771-301-109-MELVYN-HAMMARBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-341", "path": "/courses/3771", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3771/sections", "values": [{"name": "PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-341-301", "path": "/courses/3771/sections/301", "id": "3771-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-341-301"]}]}, "id": 3771, "aliases": ["ANTH-341"]}
