{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1208"}, "description": "From the inception of the discipline, anthropologists have applied their ethnographic and theoretical knowledge to policy issues concerning the alleviation of practical human problems. This approach has not only benefited peoples in need but it has also enriched the discipline, providing anthropologists with the opportunity to develop new theories and methodologies from a problem-centered approach. The class will examine the connection between anthropology and policy, theory and practice (or 'praxis'), research and application. We will study these connections by reading about historical and current projects. As an ABCS course, students will also volunteer in a volunteer organization of their choice in the Philadelphia area, conduct anthropological research on the organization, and suggest ways that the anthropological approach might support the efforts of the organization. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ANTHROPOLOGY & POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15324/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "ANTHROPOLOGY & POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-305-401", "path": "/courses/15324/sections/401", "id": "15324-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-305-401", "URBS-409-401", "ANTH-609-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/15324/sections/401/reviews/99-PAULA-W--SABLOFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/99-PAULA-W--SABLOFF", "first_name": "PAULA W.", "last_name": "SABLOFF", "id": "99-PAULA-W--SABLOFF", "name": "PAULA W.
