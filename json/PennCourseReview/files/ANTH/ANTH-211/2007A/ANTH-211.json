{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/126"}, "description": "This course provides a basic survey of the archaeology of indigenous peoples of North America from the earliest inhabitants until the arrival of Europeans. The regional coverage includes the continental U.S., northern Mexico, Canada, and the Arctic. Because of time limitations, specific emphasis will be placed on the Midwest, Southwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. Topics include the history of North American archaeology, peopling of the continent, origins and evolution of agriculture, early village life, native architecture, prehistoric art and symbolism, native american cosmology and astronomy, ancient technology, outside contacts and relationships, prehistoric economies and trade, social and political structure, the rise of cultural complexity, and early contacts with Europeans. The focus will be on the archaeological record combined with analogy from ethnohistory and ethnography. This regional survey course is designed for mid-level undergraduates. There are no formal prerequisites for the course, although it is expected that students have taken ANTH 001. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "NORTH AMERICAN ARCH'Y", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14062/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "1.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "NORTH AMERICAN ARCH'Y", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-211-001", "path": "/courses/14062/sections/001", "id": "14062-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-211-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/14062/sections/001/reviews/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "PREUCEL", "id": "108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "name": "ROBERT W.
