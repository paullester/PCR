{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2962"}, "description": "There has been a great deal of discussion, of late, about civilization and attacks upon it. This course examines the meaning of \"civilization\" and \"progress\" by way of i) classical sources in social thought, ii) pivotal issues in contemporary cultural anthropology and iii) materials related to South Asia -- India in particular. The course demands close readings of (at times) dense texts, class presentations, short video reaction papers, longer papers per assignments given and a research-informed final paper. The class format combines discussion with lectures with an emphasis on discussion. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "DEVELOP DEBATE IN INDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7298/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "DEVELOP DEBATE IN INDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-137-401", "path": "/courses/7298/sections/401", "id": "7298-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-137-401", "SAST-137-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/7298/sections/401/reviews/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "first_name": "GAUTAM", "last_name": "GHOSH", "id": "88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "name": "GAUTAM GHOSH"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "7298-401-88-GAUTAM-GHOSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-137", "path": "/courses/7298", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7298/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEVELOP DEBATE IN INDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-137-401", "path": "/courses/7298/sections/401", "id": "7298-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-137-401", "SAST-137-401"]}]}, "id": 7298, "aliases": ["ANTH-137", "SAST-137"]}
