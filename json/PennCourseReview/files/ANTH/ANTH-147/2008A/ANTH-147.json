{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4780"}, "description": "What is a border? Are international borders objective facts, self-evident territorial limits making where one society ends and another begins? Or are they sites where state authorites wield power over human mobility, connections, identity and belonging? This course examines the relationship between borders and human experience. We will explore such timely issues as the debates concerning the US-Mexico border, the abolishing of internal borders in the European Union, everyday life on both sides of the wall dividing Israel and Palestine and cross-border smuggling of human organs from the Third into the First world. Through an analysis of these and other cases we will learn about the variety of ways in which borders organize social, individual and biological life, and how at the same time human activity challenges, undermines and reconfigures borders. The readings and discussions will also cast historical light on such issues as the formation of territorial boundaries in the Old and the New World, the inventions of passports, visas and border controls, the role of the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, the development of customs systems and modern migration regulations. Course materials will include scholarly works from a variety of disciplines, as well as fiction, personal narratives, images and film. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "BORDERS & HUMAN LIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19743/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.61", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "1.94", "rRecommendMajor": "2.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.22", "rWorkRequired": "3.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.39", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "BORDERS & HUMAN LIVES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-147-401", "path": "/courses/19743/sections/401", "id": "19743-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-147-401", "PSCI-190-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/19743/sections/401/reviews/5129-KAROLINA-SZMAGALSKA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5129-KAROLINA-SZMAGALSKA", "first_name": "KAROLINA", "last_name": "SZMAGALSKA", "id": "5129-KAROLINA-SZMAGALSKA", "name": "KAROLINA SZMAGALSKA"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "19743-401-5129-KAROLINA-SZMAGALSKA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-147", "path": "/courses/19743", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19743/sections", "values": [{"name": "BORDERS & HUMAN LIVES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-147-401", "path": "/courses/19743/sections/401", "id": "19743-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-147-401", "PSCI-190-401"]}]}, "id": 19743, "aliases": ["ANTH-147", "PSCI-190"]}
