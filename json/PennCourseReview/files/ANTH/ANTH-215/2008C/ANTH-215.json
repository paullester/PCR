{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3275"}, "description": "This course applies an anthropological perspective to the study of Latin America. We will examine the intersections of gender, class, race, ethnicity, and sexuality in relation to major themes in the politics of Latin America both historically and in the present time; themes will include nationalism and state formation, social movements, multicultural policies, neoliberal restructuring, development, and globalization and diaspora. Keeping cultural identities and relations of power central to our analysis we will employ ethnographic case studies to relate the personal experiences of individuals in Latin America to broader social/political/economic trends throughout the region. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "WHAT IS CULTURE?", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18263/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "3.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "WHAT IS CULTURE?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-215-301", "path": "/courses/18263/sections/301", "id": "18263-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-215-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/18263/sections/301/reviews/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "first_name": "GAUTAM", "last_name": "GHOSH", "id": "88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "name": "GAUTAM GHOSH"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "18263-301-88-GAUTAM-GHOSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-215", "path": "/courses/18263", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18263/sections", "values": [{"name": "WHAT IS CULTURE?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-215-301", "path": "/courses/18263/sections/301", "id": "18263-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-215-301"]}]}, "id": 18263, "aliases": ["ANTH-215"]}
