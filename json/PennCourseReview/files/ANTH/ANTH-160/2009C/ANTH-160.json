{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3820"}, "description": "Myths are powerful symbolic stories that shape how we interpret, feel about and act upon the world around us. They have been important throughout time and across cultures for the help they give humans as they make their way through social interactions of all kinds. Traditional mythological subjects of creations, hero quests, and gods and monsters are found in all the non-Western, non-industrial cultures that anthropologists study. But we can also see similar tales in our own contemporary American culture, especially in the form of blockbuster movies. This course looks at popular Hollywood movies as a form of mythology that people use to interpret, organize and make sense of the world around them. We will be applying theories from anthropology and mythology as well as analyzing the incorporation of movie mythology into everyday life through fan culture, merchandise, advertising and related media. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "MYTHOLOGY & THE MOVIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16936/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.69", "rDifficulty": "2.24", "rStimulateInterest": "2.49", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "2.46", "rReadingsValue": "1.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.26", "rCommAbility": "2.21", "rInstructorQuality": "2.23"}, "section": {"name": "MYTHOLOGY & THE MOVIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-160-401", "path": "/courses/16936/sections/401", "id": "16936-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-160-401", "CINE-106-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/16936/sections/401/reviews/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "first_name": "LOUISE", "last_name": "KRASNIEWICZ", "id": "2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ", "name": "LOUISE KRASNIEWICZ"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "16936-401-2851-LOUISE-KRASNIEWICZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-160", "path": "/courses/16936", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16936/sections", "values": [{"name": "MYTHOLOGY & THE MOVIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-160-401", "path": "/courses/16936/sections/401", "id": "16936-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-160-401", "CINE-106-401"]}]}, "id": 16936, "aliases": ["ANTH-160", "CINE-106"]}
