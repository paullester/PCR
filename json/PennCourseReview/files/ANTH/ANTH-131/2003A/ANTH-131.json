{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1201"}, "description": "This class focuses on the history and archaeology of the infamous trade route across Asia called the Silk Road. We will explore such issues as what sparked people to begin long distance trade between China and the West - what was traded and why, and how did this trade affect the cultures along this fabled trail in Central Asia? We will read and discuss 18th and 19th c. traveller's accounts, current archaeological reports, and weave these into a history of the region that is returning to global importance. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "EXPLORING THE SILK ROAD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1287/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "1.46", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.54", "rCommAbility": "3.54", "rInstructorQuality": "3.77"}, "section": {"name": "EXPLORING THE SILK ROAD", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-131-301", "path": "/courses/1287/sections/301", "id": "1287-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-131-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/1287/sections/301/reviews/1783-FREDRIK-T--HIEBERT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1783-FREDRIK-T--HIEBERT", "first_name": "FREDRIK T.", "last_name": "HIEBERT", "id": "1783-FREDRIK-T--HIEBERT", "name": "FREDRIK T.
