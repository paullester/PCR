The course uses archaeological illustrations to indicate the relationships of archaeological interpretations with cultural and physical anthropology. It also fulfils a history and tradition sector. \r\n\r\nWhile some students raved about the course, many complained that the lectures were unclear and lacked structure. One student said, \u201cthe class is good as a study of Paleolithic archaeology, but bad as an intro to archaeology. It was not what I was expecting and that was disappointing.\u201d However, not everyone felt similarly. A different student commented, \u201cI have learned a great deal about archaeological fieldwork and the struggles archaeologists face through this course. It was very worthwhile.\u201d Students criticized the lack of readings during the second half of the course, saying that it made learning more difficult. Overall, the reviews were mixed; some called the class \u201cthe best I\u2019ve taken at Penn\u201d while others claimed it was \u201cthe worst.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile not everyone liked the course, most agreed that Professor Dibble was \u201ca great teacher\u201d who was an \u201centhralling and entertaining lecturer\u201d despite the fact that his teaching style was unorganized.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Archaeology is a requirement for all Anthropology majors. Students mentioned that it was not too difficult to make a good grade, but more than one said that the grading often seemed unfair.
