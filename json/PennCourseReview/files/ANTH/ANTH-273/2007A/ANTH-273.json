{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3994"}, "description": "In some parts of the world spending on pharmaceuticals is astronomical. In others, people struggle for survival amid new and reemerging epidemics and have little of no access to basic or life-saving therapies. Treatments for infectious diseases that disproportionately affect the world's poor remain under-researched and global health disparities are increasing. This interdisciplinary seminar integrates perspectives from the social sciences and the biomedical sciences to explore 1) the development and global flows of medical technologies; 2) how the health of individuals and groups is affected by medical technologies, public policy, and the forces of globalization as each of these impacts local worlds. \n\nThe seminar is structured to allow us to examine specific case material from around the world (Haiti, South Africa, Brazil, Russia, China, India, for example), and to address the ways in which social, political-economic, and technological factors -- which are increasingly global in nature -- influence basic biological mechanisms and disease outcomes and distribution. As we analyze each case and gain familiarity with ethnographic methods, we will ask how more effective interventions can be formulated. The course draws from historical and ethnographic accounts, medical journals, ethical analyses, and films, and familiarizes students with critical debates on globalization and with local responses to globalizing processes. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "GLOBALIZATION & HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14067/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.62", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.19", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBALIZATION & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-273-301", "path": "/courses/14067/sections/301", "id": "14067-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-273-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/14067/sections/301/reviews/4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA", "first_name": "ADRIANA", "last_name": "PETRYNA", "id": "4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA", "name": "ADRIANA PETRYNA"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "14067-301-4142-ADRIANA-PETRYNA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-273", "path": "/courses/14067", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14067/sections", "values": [{"name": "GLOBALIZATION & HEALTH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-273-301", "path": "/courses/14067/sections/301", "id": "14067-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-273-301"]}]}, "id": 14067, "aliases": ["ANTH-273"]}
