{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2732"}, "description": "The major goal of this course is to explore the various pathways to political power through focusing on the varied material and social sources of power. The definition of political power is the ability to exact tribute in the form of surplus goods and labor. No matter the pathway to power, leaders use ritual to promote political agendas and to explain and situate political change in familiar cultural constructs. We explore these issues in the rise and fall of ancient states using cross-cultural case studies from history and ethnography to define different types of political systems and to evaluate archaeological indicators (e.g., public iconography, subsistence systems, private/public monumental architecture, ceremonial complexes, ritual deposits, temple estates, military organizations, etc.). \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "RITUAL/PWR/& ANCIENT STS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6166/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "RITUAL/PWR/& ANCIENT STS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-465-301", "path": "/courses/6166/sections/301", "id": "6166-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-465-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/6166/sections/301/reviews/2732-LISA-J-LUCERO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2732-LISA-J-LUCERO", "first_name": "LISA J", "last_name": "LUCERO", "id": "2732-LISA-J-LUCERO", "name": "LISA J LUCERO"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "6166-301-2732-LISA-J-LUCERO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-465", "path": "/courses/6166", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6166/sections", "values": [{"name": "RITUAL/PWR/& ANCIENT STS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-465-301", "path": "/courses/6166/sections/301", "id": "6166-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-465-301"]}]}, "id": 6166, "aliases": ["ANTH-465"]}
