{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4534"}, "description": "Most people's information about the Past is drawn from coffee table picture books, popular movies, video games, documentaries about discoveries of \"ancient, mysterious, and lost\" civilizations, and tours often lead by guides of limited or even dubious credentials. How are these ideas presented, formed, and circulated? Who creates and selects the information presented in this diverse media? Are these presentations accurate? Do they promote or hurt scientific explanations? Can the artistic, aesthetic, and scientific realms be bridged to effectively promote and interpret the past? How can modern technologies be applied to do a better job at presenting what is difficult to experience firsthand? This class will focus on case studies, critiques, and methods of how archaeology and the past are created, presented and used in movies, museums, games, the internet, and art. \n\nEach year, the studio-seminar focuses on a project. In addition to exploring general concepts of archaeology and the media, students will work in teams to produce an interactive, digital media exhibit using the latest modeling visualization programs for presenting the sacred landscape of the Inca capital of Cuzco, Peru. Cuzco is one of the most important UNESCO World Heritage sites and visited by nearly a million tourists a year. Potential class projects include fly-throughs of architectural and landscape renderings, simulations of astronomy and cosmology, modeling of human behavior within architectural and landscape settings, and study artifacts in the Penn Museum. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "VISUALIZING THE PAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24159/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.86", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "1.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.14", "rCourseQuality": "1.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.73", "rReadingsValue": "1.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.80", "rCommAbility": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "2.17"}, "section": {"name": "VISUALIZING THE PAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-106-401", "path": "/courses/24159/sections/401", "id": "24159-401", "aliases": ["CIS-106-401", "ANTH-258-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/24159/sections/401/reviews/102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON", "first_name": "CLARK LOWDEN", "last_name": "ERICKSON", "id": "102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON", "name": "CLARK LOWDEN ERICKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "24159-401-102-CLARK-LOWDEN-ERICKSON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.86", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "2.14", "rCourseQuality": "1.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "1.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.80", "rCommAbility": "2.53", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "VISUALIZING THE PAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-106-401", "path": "/courses/24159/sections/401", "id": "24159-401", "aliases": ["CIS-106-401", "ANTH-258-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/24159/sections/401/reviews/1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "first_name": "NORMAN I", "last_name": "BADLER", "id": "1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "name": "NORMAN I BADLER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "24159-401-1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-106", "path": "/courses/24159", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24159/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISUALIZING THE PAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-106-401", "path": "/courses/24159/sections/401", "id": "24159-401", "aliases": ["CIS-106-401", "ANTH-258-401"]}]}, "id": 24159, "aliases": ["CIS-106", "ANTH-258"]}
