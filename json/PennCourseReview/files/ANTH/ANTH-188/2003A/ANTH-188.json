{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1203"}, "description": "In 1990 the United States Congress passed the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). This Act acknowledges the interests of the federally recognized Native American tribes and organizations in skeletal remains, associated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony held by museums and other institutions that receive federal funding. Proponents of the Act have characterized it as a human rights bill, while detractors see it as a wholesale capitulation to Native American radicals leading to the lost of valuable scientific information. This course explores the history of the law, its implementation by museums, and its implications forthe practice of both North American archaeology and museums studies. Case studies include the Zuni War gods, Larson Bay, Kennewick man. Examples from the ongoing repatriation efforts of the University of Pennsylvania Museum will also be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "WHO OWNS THE PAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1290/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "WHO OWNS THE PAST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-188-001", "path": "/courses/1290/sections/001", "id": "1290-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-188-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/1290/sections/001/reviews/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "PREUCEL", "id": "108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "name": "ROBERT W.
