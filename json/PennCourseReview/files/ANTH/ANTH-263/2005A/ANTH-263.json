{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3610"}, "description": "This course explores the role that language plays in human thought and culture.Is there something unique about human language with respect to other forms of animal communication? What is the role of language in enabling distinctively human ways of thinking and communicating? Approaching these questions from an evolutionary standpoint requires understanding human language as, not a replacement of, but a development within (or alongside) earlier systems of communicative display. The concepts of universals, those features of all human language, and particulars, those features that vary from language to language, are explored in order to understand their implications for thought and culture. Language use in various societies and contexts at both micro-and macro-discursive levels are examined throughout the course. How does performed language do work to represent/reflect social personae, to make new facts in the world, and to change power relationships? \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "LANG, CULTURE, THOUGHT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10039/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "LANG, CULTURE, THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-263-601", "path": "/courses/10039/sections/601", "id": "10039-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-263-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/10039/sections/601/reviews/3626-JENNIFER-E-JACOBS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3626-JENNIFER-E-JACOBS", "first_name": "JENNIFER E", "last_name": "JACOBS", "id": "3626-JENNIFER-E-JACOBS", "name": "JENNIFER E JACOBS"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "10039-601-3626-JENNIFER-E-JACOBS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-263", "path": "/courses/10039", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10039/sections", "values": [{"name": "LANG, CULTURE, THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ANTH-263-601", "path": "/courses/10039/sections/601", "id": "10039-601", "aliases": ["ANTH-263-601"]}]}, "id": 10039, "aliases": ["ANTH-263"]}
