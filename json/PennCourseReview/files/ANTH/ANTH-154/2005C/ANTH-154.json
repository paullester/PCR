{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/124"}, "description": "The morality, rights, and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns, through health-promoting moderation arguments, to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses, where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus, or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "MED ANTH OF ALCHOHOL USE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11400/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.87", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.07"}, "section": {"name": "MED ANTH OF ALCHOHOL USE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-154-401", "path": "/courses/11400/sections/401", "id": "11400-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-154-401", "HSOC-154-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/11400/sections/401/reviews/106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN", "first_name": "JANET ANN", "last_name": "CHRZAN", "id": "106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN", "name": "JANET ANN CHRZAN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "11400-401-106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-154", "path": "/courses/11400", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11400/sections", "values": [{"name": "MED ANTH OF ALCHOHOL USE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-154-401", "path": "/courses/11400/sections/401", "id": "11400-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-154-401", "HSOC-154-401"]}]}, "id": 11400, "aliases": ["ANTH-154", "HSOC-154"]}
