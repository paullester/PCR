{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/124"}, "description": "The morality, rights, and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns, through health-promoting moderation arguments, to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses, where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus, or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "LECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3759/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-154-401", "path": "/courses/3759/sections/401", "id": "3759-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-154-401", "HSOC-154-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/3759/sections/401/reviews/106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN", "first_name": "JANET ANN", "last_name": "CHRZAN", "id": "106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN", "name": "JANET ANN CHRZAN"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "3759-401-106-JANET-ANN-CHRZAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-154", "path": "/courses/3759", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3759/sections", "values": [{"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-154-401", "path": "/courses/3759/sections/401", "id": "3759-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-154-401", "HSOC-154-401"]}]}, "id": 3759, "aliases": ["ANTH-154", "HSOC-154"]}
