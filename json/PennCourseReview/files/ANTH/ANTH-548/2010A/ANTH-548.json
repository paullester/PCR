{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2733"}, "description": "The single most resilient structure in the vertabrate body is the dentition. Because tooth enamel is over 90% mineral in composition, teeth have a tendency to be preserved in the fossil and archaeological record. This course will explore in detail all aspects of the structure and microstructure of the dentition used in biological anthropology. These topic areas include: demography of ancient populations, fossil studies including the use of the dentition in the construction of evolutionary relationships, the dentition as population health markers, growth and development studies, and the relationship of teeth/masticatory complex to diet. Opportunity exists for independent research on Museum collections (including topics covered within forensic anthropology). \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "DENTAL ANTHROPOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25606/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.38", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "DENTAL ANTHROPOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-548-301", "path": "/courses/25606/sections/301", "id": "25606-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-548-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/25606/sections/301/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
