{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4544"}, "description": "This course examines some of the ways in which religious groups mobilize media technologies and respond to the inescapable ubiquity of mass mediation. Students will try to determine how such mass mediation helps to build/reconfigure transnational communities of spiritual belief and practice. The course focuses on various forms of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam (especially, but not exclusively, in their African-American incarnations) in an effort to assess how their practitioners deploy media technology to disseminate (and as part of) their religious/spiritual cosmologies. For example, we will look at (i) Christianity and televangelism, (ii) Muslim self-representations in film and broadcast radio/television, and (iii) Jewish (including \"Black Hebrew\") uses of cable access programs, self-produced DVDs/CDs, and the Internet. We will try to ascertain how new media technologies recalibrate traditional religious practices and potentially reconfigure theological and Diasporic communities. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "TELEVISED REDEMPTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17176/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "TELEVISED REDEMPTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-422-401", "path": "/courses/17176/sections/401", "id": "17176-401", "aliases": ["COMM-422-401", "ANTH-423-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/17176/sections/401/reviews/3923-JOHN-L--JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3923-JOHN-L--JACKSON", "first_name": "JOHN L.", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "3923-JOHN-L--JACKSON", "name": "JOHN L.
