{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2961"}, "description": "This course will outline Neandertal biology, behavior, and current debates over the place of the Neandertals in human evolution. The main goal of the course is an up-to-date understanding about who the Neandertals were, and how they lived, through the examination of paleontological and archaeological data. What did they look like? What did they eat? What sort of weapons did they make? What's this I hear about a cave bear cult? As we do this, we will also explore the history of scientific and popular thought about Neandertals and how it has reflected changes in broader societal attitudes over time. The course will include in-class, hands-on laboratory activities. The reading list will range from selected journal articles to excerpts from popular literature like 'Clan of the Cave Bear.' \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "THE NEANDERTALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10024/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.88", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.63"}, "section": {"name": "THE NEANDERTALS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-108-301", "path": "/courses/10024/sections/301", "id": "10024-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-108-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/10024/sections/301/reviews/3623-ALEXANDRE-STEENHUYSE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3623-ALEXANDRE-STEENHUYSE", "first_name": "ALEXANDRE", "last_name": "STEENHUYSE", "id": "3623-ALEXANDRE-STEENHUYSE", "name": "ALEXANDRE STEENHUYSE"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "10024-301-3623-ALEXANDRE-STEENHUYSE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-108", "path": "/courses/10024", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10024/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE NEANDERTALS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-108-301", "path": "/courses/10024/sections/301", "id": "10024-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-108-301"]}]}, "id": 10024, "aliases": ["ANTH-108"]}
