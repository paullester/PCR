{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3606"}, "description": "The goal of this course is to understand the ultimate and proximate factors underlying the nature of human and non-human primate relationships, with a focus on male-female relationships across cultures and across the life-span. To this end, we will explore comparative research on genetics, neurobiology, hormones and behavior from disciplines including biopsychology/neuroscience, biological anthropology, social-personality psychology, and evolutionary biology. The course is organized to engage students in active learning through their direct interaction with researchers, both in the classroom and in a relaxed, informal environment. The first weekly meeting will be devoted to discussing readings related to the topic of an invited speaker presentation scheduled for the second weekly meeting. The invited speakers, from different schools at Penn and from other institutions, will interact directly with students in two occasions. Following the speaker presentation, there will be a first opportunity to engage in discussions with the speaker over a meal. The second meeting will take place during a round-table organized the following day. The goal of these meetings is for students to explore CONCRETE research opportunities that may be available at Penn during the academic year and/or at other institutions during the summer. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND MARRIAGE: THE BIOLOGICAL BASES OF MALE-FEMALE RELATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28526/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.67", "rTAQuality": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "2.87", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND MARRIAGE: THE BIOLOGICAL BASES OF MALE-FEMALE RELATION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-222-301", "path": "/courses/28526/sections/301", "id": "28526-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-222-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/28526/sections/301/reviews/2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "first_name": "EDUARDO", "last_name": "FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "id": "2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE", "name": "EDUARDO FERNANDEZ-DUQUE"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "28526-301-2848-EDUARDO-FERNANDEZ-DUQUE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-222", "path": "/courses/28526", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28526/sections", "values": [{"name": "LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND MARRIAGE: THE BIOLOGICAL BASES OF MALE-FEMALE RELATION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-222-301", "path": "/courses/28526/sections/301", "id": "28526-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-222-301"]}]}, "id": 28526, "aliases": ["ANTH-222"]}
