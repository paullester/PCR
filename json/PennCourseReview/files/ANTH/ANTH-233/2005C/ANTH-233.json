{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2462"}, "description": "This course offers a survey of readings in the historical anthropology of South Asia, India in particular. Readings touch on an array of topics, including (post) colonialism, nationalism, violence, village life, family life, media and diaspora. The common theme will be a focus on how social agents are constructed and represented, and how social change is effected. Class sessions will combine lecture and discussion, with an emphasis on the latter. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "S ASIA:  ANTHS & HISTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11403/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.75", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "S ASIA:  ANTHS & HISTS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-233-401", "path": "/courses/11403/sections/401", "id": "11403-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-233-401", "SAST-333-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/11403/sections/401/reviews/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "first_name": "GAUTAM", "last_name": "GHOSH", "id": "88-GAUTAM-GHOSH", "name": "GAUTAM GHOSH"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "11403-401-88-GAUTAM-GHOSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-233", "path": "/courses/11403", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11403/sections", "values": [{"name": "S ASIA:  ANTHS & HISTS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-233-401", "path": "/courses/11403/sections/401", "id": "11403-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-233-401", "SAST-333-401"]}]}, "id": 11403, "aliases": ["ANTH-233", "SAST-333"]}
