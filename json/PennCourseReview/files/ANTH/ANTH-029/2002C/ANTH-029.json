{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1632"}, "description": "What's going on right now in the region stretching from northern Mexico to the Panama canal, and why should we care ? How can anthropological knowledge and method help us better understand the social, political, religious, economic, cultural, and demographic changes that mark this region? This discussion-based seminar will use the metaphor of \"movement\" and \"exchange\" (of people, commodities, ideas, cultural forms) between Mesoamerica and the US to answer these questions. Specific topics may include: the rise of Protestantism, illegal migration to the US, tourism, NAFTA, indigenous political movements, and war. Throughout the semester, we will consider how examining issues such as these helps us not only to understand Mesoamerica itself, but also to understand the relationship between Mesoamerica and the US. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "MESOAMERICA MODERN WRLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2592/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.77", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "2.46", "rRecommendMajor": "2.77", "rCourseQuality": "2.15", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.77", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "2.85"}, "section": {"name": "MESOAMERICA MODERN WRLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-029-401", "path": "/courses/2592/sections/401", "id": "2592-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-029-401", "LTAM-029-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/2592/sections/401/reviews/1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING", "first_name": "CATHERINE", "last_name": "NEWLING", "id": "1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING", "name": "CATHERINE NEWLING"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "2592-401-1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-029", "path": "/courses/2592", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2592/sections", "values": [{"name": "MESOAMERICA MODERN WRLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-029-401", "path": "/courses/2592/sections/401", "id": "2592-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-029-401", "LTAM-029-401"]}]}, "id": 2592, "aliases": ["ANTH-029", "LTAM-029"]}
