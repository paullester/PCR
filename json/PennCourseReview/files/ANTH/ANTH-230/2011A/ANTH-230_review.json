Topics include human osteology, the recovery of bodies, the analysis of life history, the reconstruction of causes of death, and various case studies where anthropologists have contributed significantly to solving forensic cases. &#8232;The course discussions focus on the limitations of forensic anthropology and the application of DNA recovery to skeletal/mummified materials. &#8232;The course was broken down into many small segments that combined together at the end of the semester. &#8232;&#8232;Students described Professor Monge as \u201chilarious\u201d, \u201ccaptivating\u201d and \u201cone of the most interesting people you will ever meet\u201d. She is very experienced in the field and has a lot of things to share. However, small number of students thought Professor Monge was sometimes \u201cunorganized\u201d and \u201con tangents\u201d. &#8232;&#8232;A paper and project are due back to back at the end of the semester. The course does not seem to follow the syllabus and students seem to be confused about the course structure. &#8232;This review was based on less than 8 student comments.", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/21261/sections/401/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
