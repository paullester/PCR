Another student mentioned the Professor was \u201cimpossible to contact.\u201d While she was quite \u201cpersonable,\u201d it was difficult to maintain communication with her via email. Nonetheless, it was obvious to students that she \u201cis clearly an expert in the field\u201d and most mentioned they \u201cwould take anything she was teaching.\u201d &#8232;\r\n\r\n&#8232;This class includes assigned projects, but some students felt they \u201cdid not seem to incorporate what we learned in class.\u201d Further, the work was described as \u201cscattered:\u201d \u201cassigned one day, then reassigned for other days quite frequently.\u201d This class is appropriate for students pursuing a Liberal and Professional Studies degree but, as it is introductory, is open to other students as well.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/22625/sections/601/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
