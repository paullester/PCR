{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2964"}, "description": "In this seminar we will explore the various relationships between food and culture. Readings will draw from a range of fields aside from anthropology, including psychology, food studies, history, nutrition, and sociology. We will read about and discuss cross-cultural variation in food habits, the meanings underlying eating and food in the United States, and the different ways that individuals construct 'self' and identity through food and eating. Discussion in class will rely on in-depth reading, analysis, and discussion of the assigned texts. There will be a few short writing assignments throughout the class. In addition, students will conduct interviews and then write a paper based on both these and research in the published literature. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "FOOD AND CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15315/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.13", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.19", "rWorkRequired": "2.87", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "2.27", "rInstructorQuality": "2.19"}, "section": {"name": "FOOD AND CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-184-301", "path": "/courses/15315/sections/301", "id": "15315-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-184-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/15315/sections/301/reviews/1253-JANE-KAUER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1253-JANE-KAUER", "first_name": "JANE", "last_name": "KAUER", "id": "1253-JANE-KAUER", "name": "JANE KAUER"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "15315-301-1253-JANE-KAUER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-184", "path": "/courses/15315", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15315/sections", "values": [{"name": "FOOD AND CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-184-301", "path": "/courses/15315/sections/301", "id": "15315-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-184-301"]}]}, "id": 15315, "aliases": ["ANTH-184"]}
