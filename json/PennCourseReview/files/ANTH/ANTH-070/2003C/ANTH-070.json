Transitions from military dictatorships to civilian rule in Latin America. Events such as these imply that the desire for \"democracy\" is universal (or nearly so). But does a widespread desire for democracy necessarily mean that it is understood, and practiced, uniformly? This course argues that it does not. As a result, instead of learning about democracy in terms of what we already think we know about it, we will start from scratch by asking, \"What is democracy, anyway?\" We will use the tools of anthropology (an attention to cultural variation, and to local populations' definitions of concepts that we assume to be self- evident) to examine the malleability of the notion of \"democracy,\" and the consequences of such variation. Who receives development aid, who gets to exert power, whose human rights are abused, and who gets to participate in governance as a citizen- these are just a few of the implications of deploying varying definitions of \"democracy\" for particular ends, by particular groups. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "DEMOC & CITZ: ANTH PERSP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3750/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.35", "rDifficulty": "2.76", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "DEMOC & CITZ: ANTH PERSP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-070-301", "path": "/courses/3750/sections/301", "id": "3750-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-070-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/3750/sections/301/reviews/1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING", "first_name": "CATHERINE", "last_name": "NEWLING", "id": "1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING", "name": "CATHERINE NEWLING"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "3750-301-1248-CATHERINE-NEWLING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-070", "path": "/courses/3750", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3750/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEMOC & CITZ: ANTH PERSP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-070-301", "path": "/courses/3750/sections/301", "id": "3750-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-070-301"]}]}, "id": 3750, "aliases": ["ANTH-070"]}
