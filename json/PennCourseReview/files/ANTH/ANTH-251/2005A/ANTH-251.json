{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3608"}, "description": "What can studying religion cross-culturally tell us about its role in human societies? How have anthropologists accounted for both the seeming universality of religion as a category of human experience and for the diversity of forms religions take? How do people in different societies conceptualize the sacred and their relationship to it, and what effects do religious practices have on other spheres of human activity, from politics to kinship? How do religious practices respond (and contribute) to cultural change and upheaval? These are some of the questions we will address through our comparative study of religions, using readings, films, discussions, field trips, and short field research assignments. This course combines foundational readings in the anthropology of religion with cutting-edge ethnographies of particular religious traditions. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "ANTH OF RELIGIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10037/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "ANTH OF RELIGIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-251-401", "path": "/courses/10037/sections/401", "id": "10037-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-251-401", "RELS-206-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/10037/sections/401/reviews/1246-KRISTINA-S--WIRTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1246-KRISTINA-S--WIRTZ", "first_name": "KRISTINA S.", "last_name": "WIRTZ", "id": "1246-KRISTINA-S--WIRTZ", "name": "KRISTINA S.
