{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/131"}, "description": "In this course, we will examine the interaction between hormones, behavior and the ecological context in which individuals develop. The course is divided in two parts: the first half will be devoted to an overview of the fields of behavioral endocrinology and reproductive ecology. We will discuss hormone-behavior interactions mainly in humans and non-human primates. The second half will be a laboratory-based hands-on experience during which students will design and conduct a pilot study on the hormonal correlates of behavior on campus. Students will learn the basics of hormonal assays at the Reproductive Ecology Laboratory and will be able to work on their own pilot studies. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "SOCIAL REORGANIZATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1295/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.86", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIAL REORGANIZATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-262-401", "path": "/courses/1295/sections/401", "id": "1295-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-262-401", "ANTH-662-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/1295/sections/401/reviews/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "first_name": "BRIAN J", "last_name": "SPOONER", "id": "89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "name": "BRIAN J SPOONER"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "1295-401-89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-262", "path": "/courses/1295", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1295/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOCIAL REORGANIZATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-262-401", "path": "/courses/1295/sections/401", "id": "1295-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-262-401", "ANTH-662-401"]}]}, "id": 1295, "aliases": ["ANTH-262", "ANTH-662"]}
