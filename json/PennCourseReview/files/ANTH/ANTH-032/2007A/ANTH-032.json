{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2960"}, "description": "The civilization of the ancient Maya, which flourished between approximately 1000 B.C. and the Spanish Conquest of the sixteenth century A.D. in what is now southern Mexico and northern Central America, has long been of wide public interest. The soaring temples of Tikal, the beautiful palaces of Palenque, the sophisticated carved monuments and sculpture, and the complex writing, astronomical, and mathematical systems of this pre-industrial civilization have been widely photographed and written about. However, revolutionary advances in archaeological research which have provided important new data about the farmers and craftspeople who supported the great Maya rulers, and the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics writing over the past two decades have led to the overthrow of the traditional model of Lowland Maya civilization and the growth of new understandings of the development of Lowland Maya civilization, the rise of urban states, and the successful adaptation to a difficult and varied tropical environment. Through a series of case studies, this seminar will examine the research that has led to these new insights and will evaluate the exciting new models of Maya civilization and its achievements that have emerged in recent years. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "RISE & FALL ANC MAYA CIV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14049/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.33", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "1.67", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.87", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "RISE & FALL ANC MAYA CIV", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-032-401", "path": "/courses/14049/sections/401", "id": "14049-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-032-401", "LALS-032-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/14049/sections/401/reviews/4140-CHRISTOPHER--JONES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4140-CHRISTOPHER--JONES", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER.", "last_name": "JONES", "id": "4140-CHRISTOPHER--JONES", "name": "CHRISTOPHER.
