{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2211"}, "description": "An introduction to the study of the evolution of the human brain. Students will review basic concepts in evolutionary biology. The direct fossil evidence of vertebrate brain evolution will then be reviewed, and comparative (cross-species) perspectives on neuroanatomy and behavior will be emphasized. An analysis of the specific changes in the brain during human evolution will then be covered. We will consider possible sources of evidence relevant to brain evolution as well, such as the archaeological record of human behavioral evolution. Current controversies and theories about the causes and consequences of hominid brain evolution will be reviewed, including the possible role of language, tool use, sociality, dietary shifts, and other behavioral adaptations. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "INTRO EVOL OF THE BRAIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4958/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO EVOL OF THE BRAIN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-179-301", "path": "/courses/4958/sections/301", "id": "4958-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-179-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/4958/sections/301/reviews/90-P--THOMAS-SCHOENEMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/90-P--THOMAS-SCHOENEMANN", "first_name": "P.
