{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2730"}, "description": "This course provides an overview of the prehistoric cultures of the American Southwest. It interweaves archaeological data, ethnohistorical accounts, ethnographic descriptions, and indigenous perspectives. Topics covered include the history of archaeological research, origins and migrations, agriculture and land use, ideology and belief systems. Special attention will be given to Chaco and Hohokam as contrasting case studies of regional ideological systems with strong connections to indigenous people today. In addition, the course addresses such historical and contemporary questions as colonization, resistance, tourism, and repatriation. Relevant ethnographic and archaeological videos will be shown and the Southwestern collections of the University Museum will be used. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ARCHY OF AMERICAN S.WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6163/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHY OF AMERICAN S.WEST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-413-001", "path": "/courses/6163/sections/001", "id": "6163-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-413-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/6163/sections/001/reviews/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "PREUCEL", "id": "108-ROBERT-W--PREUCEL", "name": "ROBERT W.
