{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1633"}, "description": "What can we read from the stories and images represented or \"performed\" in popular culture? How do such media enrich our experiences of ourselves, our communities, and our identities? This seminar explores cross-cultural imaginations of identity in cultural performance. We examine collective identities and social inequalities as they are expressed and negotiated through public cultural exchange. Particular attention will be paid to the performance of gender and sexuality in contemporary popular culture. We will consider critical social theories, ethnographic texts, and representations from public culture film/video, television, music, web sites, books, museum exhibits, etc.). \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "PERFORMING IDENTITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2593/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.11", "rDifficulty": "1.63", "rStimulateInterest": "1.74", "rRecommendMajor": "2.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.37", "rInstructorAccess": "2.41", "rReadingsValue": "1.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "2.26", "rInstructorQuality": "2.32"}, "section": {"name": "PERFORMING IDENTITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-069-301", "path": "/courses/2593/sections/301", "id": "2593-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-069-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/2593/sections/301/reviews/1245-JULIA-OFFEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1245-JULIA-OFFEN", "first_name": "JULIA", "last_name": "OFFEN", "id": "1245-JULIA-OFFEN", "name": "JULIA OFFEN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "2593-301-1245-JULIA-OFFEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-069", "path": "/courses/2593", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2593/sections", "values": [{"name": "PERFORMING IDENTITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-069-301", "path": "/courses/2593/sections/301", "id": "2593-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-069-301"]}]}, "id": 2593, "aliases": ["ANTH-069"]}
