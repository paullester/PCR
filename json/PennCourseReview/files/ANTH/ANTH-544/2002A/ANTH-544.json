{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/143"}, "description": "Students will learn how to write, shoot edit and upload documentary films over the length of this two semester course. In the first part, students complete a series of hands-on formal training in filmcraft while they simultaneously identify a research subject that they will propose to depict in a documentary film. In the second part of the course students will produce the faculty-approved documentary themselves. The film's final cut must be screened by the end of the second semester. Students should expect to work on their projects outside class time. The school will provide basic filmmaking equipment- video cameras and computers for editing in labs. Students are responsible for all storage (computer drives), tapes, dvds, and project relatedcosts. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "MASCUL IN NARR & PERFORM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/143/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MASCUL IN NARR & PERFORM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-544-401", "path": "/courses/143/sections/401", "id": "143-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-544-401", "FOLK-540-401", "WSTD-540-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/143/sections/401/reviews/98-JAY-T-DAUTCHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/98-JAY-T-DAUTCHER", "first_name": "JAY T", "last_name": "DAUTCHER", "id": "98-JAY-T-DAUTCHER", "name": "JAY T DAUTCHER"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "143-401-98-JAY-T-DAUTCHER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-544", "path": "/courses/143", "sections": {"path": "/courses/143/sections", "values": [{"name": "MASCUL IN NARR & PERFORM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-544-401", "path": "/courses/143/sections/401", "id": "143-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-544-401", "FOLK-540-401", "WSTD-540-401"]}]}, "id": 143, "aliases": ["ANTH-544", "FOLK-540", "WSTD-540"]}
