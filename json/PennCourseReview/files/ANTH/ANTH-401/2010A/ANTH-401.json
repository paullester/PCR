More specifically, this course traces in detail the changes of Chinese family and kinship, which have been the social and ideological backbone of Chinese society. During the first half of this course we deal with the dominant social organizations, practices and ideaologies of the pre-revolutionary Chinese society. During the latter half of this course, we analyze the social movements and policies of the CCP and their impacts on the everyday life of Chinese people. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "CHINESE CULTURE&SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25599/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.91", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "1.64", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "2.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "2.27", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "CHINESE CULTURE&SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-401-401", "path": "/courses/25599/sections/401", "id": "25599-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-401-401", "EALC-037-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/25599/sections/401/reviews/4238-JAESOK-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4238-JAESOK-KIM", "first_name": "JAESOK", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "4238-JAESOK-KIM", "name": "JAESOK KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "25599-401-4238-JAESOK-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-401", "path": "/courses/25599", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25599/sections", "values": [{"name": "CHINESE CULTURE&SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-401-401", "path": "/courses/25599/sections/401", "id": "25599-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-401-401", "EALC-037-401"]}]}, "id": 25599, "aliases": ["ANTH-401", "EALC-037"]}
