{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3272"}, "description": "This course analyses the current state of globalization & sets it in historical perspective. It applies the concepts & methods of anthropology, history, political economy & sociology to the analysis and interpretation of what is actually happening in the course of the semester that relates to the progress of globalization. We focus on a series of questions not only about actual processes but about the growing awareness of them, and the consequence of this awareness. In answering these questions, we distinguish between active campaigns to cover the world (e.g. proselytism, opening up markets,democratization) and the unplanned diffusion of new ways of organizing trade, capital flows, tourism and the internet. The body of the course will deal with particular dimensions of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of these processes. The overall approach will be historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of economic, political and cultural development. The course is taught collaboratively by an anthropologist, a historian, and a sociologist, offering the opportunity to compare and contrast distinct disciplinary points of view. It seeks to develop a concept-based understanding the various dimensions of globalization: political, social, and cultural. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "Globalization and its Historical Significance", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22609/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.33", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "1.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.39", "rInstructorAccess": "2.35", "rReadingsValue": "2.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.37", "rCommAbility": "1.89", "rInstructorQuality": "2.13"}, "section": {"name": "Globalization and its Historical Significance", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-012-401", "path": "/courses/22609/sections/401", "id": "22609-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-012-401", "SOCI-012-401", "HIST-012-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/22609/sections/401/reviews/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "first_name": "BRIAN J", "last_name": "SPOONER", "id": "89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "name": "BRIAN J SPOONER"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "22609-401-89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-012", "path": "/courses/22609", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22609/sections", "values": [{"name": "Globalization and its Historical Significance", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-012-401", "path": "/courses/22609/sections/401", "id": "22609-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-012-401", "SOCI-012-401", "HIST-012-401"]}]}, "id": 22609, "aliases": ["ANTH-012", "SOCI-012", "HIST-012"]}
