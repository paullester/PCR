{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5296"}, "description": "What exactly is Native American art? Is it fine art or is it ethnic art? Or is this not a useful distinction. This course is an introduction to the art and archeology of the indigenous peoples of North America. The regional coverage includes the continental United States and Canada, focusing on the peoples of the Northeast, the Midwest, the Southwest, the Plains, the Pacific Northwest, and the Arctic and Subarctic. Topics adressed include art and artifact, function and symbol, innovation and tradition, and museums and repatriation. Special attention will be given to the changing relations between the art market, museums, and contemporary native peoples.
