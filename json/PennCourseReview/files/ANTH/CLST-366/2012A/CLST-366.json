{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5397"}, "description": "This course introduces the students to the exciting discipline of science-based archaeology which applies analytical techniques derived from the physical, biological and earth sciences to the in-depth study of archaeological remains. The course combines lectures and hands-on laboratory sessions by the instructor and guest speakers on a range of topics including technology, climate, chronology, diet, environment, and exchange patterns. Using case-studies, particular attention will be paid on materials such as ceramic, metal and stone as well as human, animal and plant remains. As an outcome, students will have a clear understanding of the potential and limitations of a range of analytical techniques. Students will also be able to develop an analytic methodology to address specific archaeological questions. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ARCHAEOLOGY & SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27192/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.92", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHAEOLOGY & SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-366-401", "path": "/courses/27192/sections/401", "id": "27192-401", "aliases": ["CLST-366-401", "ANTH-366-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/27192/sections/401/reviews/6075-MARIE-CLAUDE-BOILEAU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6075-MARIE-CLAUDE-BOILEAU", "first_name": "MARIE-CLAUDE", "last_name": "BOILEAU", "id": "6075-MARIE-CLAUDE-BOILEAU", "name": "MARIE-CLAUDE BOILEAU"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "27192-401-6075-MARIE-CLAUDE-BOILEAU"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-366", "path": "/courses/27192", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27192/sections", "values": [{"name": "ARCHAEOLOGY & SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-366-401", "path": "/courses/27192/sections/401", "id": "27192-401", "aliases": ["CLST-366-401", "ANTH-366-401"]}]}, "id": 27192, "aliases": ["CLST-366", "ANTH-366"]}
