{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5397"}, "description": "This course introduces the students to the exciting discipline of science-based archaeology which applies analytical techniques derived from the physical, biological and earth sciences to the in-depth study of archaeological remains. The course combines lectures and hands-on laboratory sessions by the instructor and guest speakers on a range of topics including technology, climate, chronology, diet, environment, and exchange patterns. Using case-studies, particular attention will be paid on materials such as ceramic, metal and stone as well as human, animal and plant remains. As an outcome, students will have a clear understanding of the potential and limitations of a range of analytical techniques. Students will also be able to develop an analytic methodology to address specific archaeological questions. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ARCHAEOLOGY & SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30091/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHAEOLOGY & SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-366-401", "path": "/courses/30091/sections/401", "id": "30091-401", "aliases": ["CLST-366-401", "ANTH-366-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/30091/sections/401/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
