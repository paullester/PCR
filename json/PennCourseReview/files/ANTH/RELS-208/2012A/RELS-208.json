Rather than seeing these stories as \"myths\" they will be treated as highly sophisticated forms of philosophy.

Many students liked being able to \u201clearn a lot about a culture [they didn\u2019t] have any background in\u201d but lamented the \u201cvast lack of structure\u201d in lectures. Students noted how \u201cthe constant emphasis on assignments completely detracted from the course,\u201d making the experience \u201ccome across more like a writing seminar.\u201d Multiple students described the pace of the course as \u201ctedious\u201d and wished they had more time to actually delve into its content.\r\n\r\n\tProfessor Powell received negative reviews from students, who felt he did not focus lectures and assignments in effective ways. Though \u201che [was] very knowledgeable on the material,\u201d he was \u201cconsistently unprepared for class\u201d and didn\u2019t seem to \u201chave more than a vague idea of what he wanted to accomplish in each class.\u201d Students also did not appreciate his lateness in returning multiple assignments when those seemed to be the course\u2019s focus.\r\n\r\n\tThe course required multiple papers of varying lengths, which amounted to a \u201cridiculous amount of work.\u201d Students struggled with \u201ca strange format for essays\u201d and received little guidance on how to write them, despite class time taken up by discussing assignments. Grading was also found to be \u201cslightly harsh without any real justification\u201d and \u201cone assignment took over six weeks to be returned.\u201d These issues led multiple students to sum up the class as \u201cawful,\u201d largely because of its format and professor.", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/28105/sections/401/reviews/4161-TIMOTHY-B--POWELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4161-TIMOTHY-B--POWELL", "first_name": "TIMOTHY B.", "last_name": "POWELL", "id": "4161-TIMOTHY-B--POWELL", "name": "TIMOTHY B.
