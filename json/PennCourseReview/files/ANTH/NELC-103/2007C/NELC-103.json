{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3914"}, "description": "The UN estimates that 2.9 of the world's 6.1 billion people live in cities and that this percentage is rapidly increasing in many parts of the world. This course examines urban life and urban problems by providing anthropological perspectives on this distinctive form of human association and land use. First we will examine the \"origin\" of cities, focusing on several of the places where cities first developed, including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13623/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.25", "rDifficulty": "2.03", "rStimulateInterest": "1.86", "rRecommendMajor": "2.58", "rCourseQuality": "2.11", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.77", "rReadingsValue": "2.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.86", "rCommAbility": "2.53", "rInstructorQuality": "2.61"}, "section": {"name": "ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-103-401", "path": "/courses/13623/sections/401", "id": "13623-401", "aliases": ["NELC-103-401", "URBS-101-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/13623/sections/401/reviews/1249-RICHARD-L-ZETTLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1249-RICHARD-L-ZETTLER", "first_name": "RICHARD L", "last_name": "ZETTLER", "id": "1249-RICHARD-L-ZETTLER", "name": "RICHARD L ZETTLER"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "13623-401-1249-RICHARD-L-ZETTLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-103", "path": "/courses/13623", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13623/sections", "values": [{"name": "ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-103-401", "path": "/courses/13623/sections/401", "id": "13623-401", "aliases": ["NELC-103-401", "URBS-101-401"]}]}, "id": 13623, "aliases": ["NELC-103", "URBS-101"]}
