{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4758"}, "description": "The creation of the state of Pakistan is often seen as the most tangible expression of the fusion between Islam, nationalism, and social activism in modern South Asia. Yet, such top-down, state-oriented phenomena are only a starting point. From the disciplinary perspective of social and cultural history, this seminar course will explore a range of intertwined expressions of Islam and nation in contemporary South Asia particularly India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Many of these expressions have challenged dominant ideological fusions of Muslim identity, national identity, state rule, and collective sovereignty as much as they reinforced it. Diverse weekly topics include \"print capitalism\" and public-sphere reformism; explicitly modernist ideas of Islam in tension withor in collusion withcolonialism; and the histories of modern tribal solidarities and Sufi brotherhoods in their often tense and conflicting connections to anti-colonialism and the post-colonial nation-state. Throughout, we will pay particular attention to the interplay between the above topics and social class and gender; and will tie in narration of the past with ongoing news coverage. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Islam & the Cultrl Politics of Nationalism: India, Pakistan, & Afghanistan", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25098/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "Islam & the Cultrl Politics of Nationalism: India, Pakistan, & Afghanistan", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-369-401", "path": "/courses/25098/sections/401", "id": "25098-401", "aliases": ["SAST-369-401", "SAST-669-401", "ANTH-369-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/25098/sections/401/reviews/4974-JAMES-CARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4974-JAMES-CARON", "first_name": "JAMES", "last_name": "CARON", "id": "4974-JAMES-CARON", "name": "JAMES CARON"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "25098-401-4974-JAMES-CARON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-369", "path": "/courses/25098", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25098/sections", "values": [{"name": "Islam & the Cultrl Politics of Nationalism: India, Pakistan, & Afghanistan", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-369-401", "path": "/courses/25098/sections/401", "id": "25098-401", "aliases": ["SAST-369-401", "SAST-669-401", "ANTH-369-401"]}]}, "id": 25098, "aliases": ["SAST-369", "SAST-669", "ANTH-369"]}
