{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/115"}, "description": "What defines Homo sapiens? A tipsy walk? An efficient but slow jogger? Produces extra-uterus fetuses? Sweats profusely and is naked? Can eat anything but specialize in nothing? Reproduces slowly and takes forever to grow up? Lives a really long time? Masters language and often uses it to deceive? Why? \n\nAnthropology 105 explores evolutionary process using humans (Homo sapiens) as a case study. This complex biological and cultural species is best understood within the framework of evolution as it has operated for over a billion years. Learn why humans are imperfect, not an end product of evolutionary change, and are still evolving with unpredictable consequences. Using 3 complexes that have some to characterize humans- bipedalism, rotary chewers, and big brains- we will trace the evolutionary history from the first life forms on earth to the human lineage that emerged in just the last 5 million years. The consequences for humans of this evolutionary history are profound and we witness this everyday in our own bodies. Touch fossil casts representing the whole of human evolution using the Penn Museum's prodigious casting program. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "HUMAN ADAPTATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28514/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "1.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "HUMAN ADAPTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-105-001", "path": "/courses/28514/sections/001", "id": "28514-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-105-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/28514/sections/001/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
