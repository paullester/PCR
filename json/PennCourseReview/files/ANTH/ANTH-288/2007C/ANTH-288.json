{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3712"}, "description": "This course is intended to examine the distinctions between scientific and non-scientific approaches in archaeology. It is designed for people with a genuine interest in learning what archaeology is really all about, and who wish to critically evaluate the many different accounts about the past in order to make decisions for themselves as to what may be reliable or unreliable information. The course will analyze a variety of case studies derived from both the archaeological and pseudo-archaeological literature in order to define criteria for evaluating the accuracy and reliability to these accounts. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "MYTH,FRAUD,SCI IN ARCHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12856/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "MYTH,FRAUD,SCI IN ARCHY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-288-001", "path": "/courses/12856/sections/001", "id": "12856-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-288-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/12856/sections/001/reviews/1258-ROBERT-J-SHARER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1258-ROBERT-J-SHARER", "first_name": "ROBERT J", "last_name": "SHARER", "id": "1258-ROBERT-J-SHARER", "name": "ROBERT J SHARER"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "12856-001-1258-ROBERT-J-SHARER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-288", "path": "/courses/12856", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12856/sections", "values": [{"name": "MYTH,FRAUD,SCI IN ARCHY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-288-001", "path": "/courses/12856/sections/001", "id": "12856-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-288-001"]}]}, "id": 12856, "aliases": ["ANTH-288"]}
