{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5069"}, "description": "Class sessions will be devoted to discussion of the dynamics of globalization with the objective of illuminating the world-historical context of the changes that are happening around us unevenly in different parts of the world today, and developing critical approaches to the available research methodologies and explanatory theories. Weekly readings will be selected from the major researchers in the field, and students will test their ideas in short research projects of their own on questions arising from the discussions. The overall approach will be historical and comparative. Apart from weekly assigned readings and participation in class discussions, requirements for the course include three short research papers. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "GLOBALIZATION: Globalization: Causes & Effects", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28521/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "1.63", "rCourseQuality": "1.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.13"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBALIZATION: Globalization: Causes & Effects", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-155-301", "path": "/courses/28521/sections/301", "id": "28521-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-155-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/28521/sections/301/reviews/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "first_name": "BRIAN J", "last_name": "SPOONER", "id": "89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER", "name": "BRIAN J SPOONER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "28521-301-89-BRIAN-J-SPOONER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-155", "path": "/courses/28521", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28521/sections", "values": [{"name": "GLOBALIZATION: Globalization: Causes & Effects", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-155-301", "path": "/courses/28521/sections/301", "id": "28521-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-155-301"]}]}, "id": 28521, "aliases": ["ANTH-155"]}
