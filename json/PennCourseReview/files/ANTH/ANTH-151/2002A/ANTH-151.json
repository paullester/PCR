{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/123"}, "description": "Over the last fifty years archaeologists have been exploring historic sites in the United States dating from both the Colonial Period and the 19th/20th centuries. What can archaeology now tell us about the origins of American society, the invasion of North America by various European peoples (Spanish, English, Dutch), the impact on native peoples, the rise of African American and Asian American cultures, major crisis (e.g. the revolution, Civil War, and the Great Depression), the settlement of the Far American West, and the final emergence of a truly national culture in the 20th century? A basic question will be how an American history based on both archaeology and archival sources is different and more complete than an image of the past drawn only from written sources. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "DR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/123/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.32", "rDifficulty": "1.58", "rStimulateInterest": "2.42", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.28", "rWorkRequired": "1.68", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.79", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "DR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-151-001", "path": "/courses/123/sections/001", "id": "123-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-151-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/123/sections/001/reviews/105-REBECCA-A-HUSS-ASHMORE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/105-REBECCA-A-HUSS-ASHMORE", "first_name": "REBECCA A", "last_name": "HUSS-ASHMORE", "id": "105-REBECCA-A-HUSS-ASHMORE", "name": "REBECCA A HUSS-ASHMORE"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "123-001-105-REBECCA-A-HUSS-ASHMORE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-151", "path": "/courses/123", "sections": {"path": "/courses/123/sections", "values": [{"name": "DR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-151-001", "path": "/courses/123/sections/001", "id": "123-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-151-001"]}]}, "id": 123, "aliases": ["ANTH-151"]}
