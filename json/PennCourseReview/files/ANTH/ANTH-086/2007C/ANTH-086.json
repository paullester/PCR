{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3274"}, "description": "Does consumption shape culture or does culture shape consumption? As even the most mundane purchase becomes socially symbolic and culturally meaningful we can persuasively argue that the concept of \"need\" has been transformed. Analyzing a variety of physical and virtual consumer venues, the goal of this seminar is to understand and to analyze historical and contemporary issues related to a culture of consumption. We investigate social and political-economic factors that impact when and how people purchase goods and argue that behavior attached to consumption includes a nexus of influences that may change periodically in response to external factors. Readings and research assignments are interdisciplinary and require a critical analysis of global/local linkages. The city of Philadelphia becomes the seminar's laboratory as we ask how have issues of culture, consumption, and global capitalism become intertwined around the world? \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND: Culture and Consumption in the Global Marketplace", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12839/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.25", "rDifficulty": "1.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "2.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.65", "rWorkRequired": "1.85", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "1.90", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND: Culture and Consumption in the Global Marketplace", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-086-301", "path": "/courses/12839/sections/301", "id": "12839-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-086-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/12839/sections/301/reviews/2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "first_name": "MARILYNNE", "last_name": "DIGGS-THOMPSON", "id": "2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON", "name": "MARILYNNE DIGGS-THOMPSON"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "12839-301-2850-MARILYNNE-DIGGS-THOMPSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-086", "path": "/courses/12839", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12839/sections", "values": [{"name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND: Culture and Consumption in the Global Marketplace", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-086-301", "path": "/courses/12839/sections/301", "id": "12839-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-086-301"]}]}, "id": 12839, "aliases": ["ANTH-086"]}
