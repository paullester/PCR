As even the most mundane purchase becomes socially symbolic and culturally meaningful we can persuasively argue that the concept of \"need\" has been transformed. Analyzing a variety of physical and virtual consumer venues, the goal of this seminar is to understand and to analyze historical and contemporary issues related to a culture of consumption. We investigate social and political-economic factors that impact when and how people purchase goods and argue that behavior attached to consumption includes a nexus of influences that may change periodically in response to external factors. Readings and research assignments are interdisciplinary and require a critical analysis of global/local linkages. The city of Philadelphia becomes the seminar's laboratory as we ask how have issues of culture, consumption, and global capitalism become intertwined around the world? \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14051/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-086", "path": "/courses/14051", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14051/sections", "values": [{"name": "DESIRE AND DEMAND", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-086-301", "path": "/courses/14051/sections/301", "id": "14051-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-086-301"]}]}, "id": 14051, "aliases": ["ANTH-086"]}
