{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3609"}, "description": "Empires have been an enduring poltical phenomenon for more than 4,000 years, from the rise of Akkad to the invasion of Iraq. This class will study the origins, structures and limitations of imperialism across space and through time, by comparing empires from Assyria to \"Indochine\", from Wati to the Spanish Empire. How and why do empires emerge? Why to empires endure (or collapse)? In addition to a study of the political aspects of imperialism, we will analyze the cultural and economic facets of imperialism, particularly acculturation, cultural hybritity and issues of identity. We will also consider the impact of modern colonialism and post-colonialism on the theory and practice of archaeology from the 19th to 21st centuries. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ARCHAEOLOGIES & EMPIRES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15323/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.20", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHAEOLOGIES & EMPIRES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-261-401", "path": "/courses/15323/sections/401", "id": "15323-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-261-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/15323/sections/401/reviews/4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "first_name": "LAUREN M.", "last_name": "RISTVET", "id": "4239-LAUREN-M--RISTVET", "name": "LAUREN M.
