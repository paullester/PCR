{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1214"}, "description": "Seminar on a rapidly developing, interdisciplinary field. Application of inorganic and organic chemical techniques for dating and characterizing ancient material remains, and assessing their technological and cultural significance. Middle-range theory--the methodology and limitations of integrating natural scientific data with archaeological hypothesis and reconstruction--is stressed. Topics include geophysical/chemical prospecting of sites, radiocarbon dating and calibration, ceramic provenancing and trade, organic contents analysis of vessels, isotopic dietary studies, and paleogenetics. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14077/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-477-401", "path": "/courses/14077/sections/401", "id": "14077-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-477-401", "HSPV-577-401", "AAMW-477-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/14077/sections/401/reviews/1787-PATRICK-MCGOVERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1787-PATRICK-MCGOVERN", "first_name": "PATRICK", "last_name": "MCGOVERN", "id": "1787-PATRICK-MCGOVERN", "name": "PATRICK MCGOVERN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "14077-401-1787-PATRICK-MCGOVERN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-477", "path": "/courses/14077", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14077/sections", "values": [{"name": "ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-477-401", "path": "/courses/14077/sections/401", "id": "14077-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-477-401", "HSPV-577-401", "AAMW-477-401"]}]}, "id": 14077, "aliases": ["ANTH-477", "HSPV-577", "AAMW-477"]}
