{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2207"}, "description": "There has long been an expectation in the West that magical belief would be extinguished by the force and spread of Enlightenment thought, scientific rationality, and secularism. Yet human belief in, practice of, and fascination with \"magic\" has proved far more resilient than predictions of the world's inevitable \"disenchantment\" foresaw. In this seminar, we will historicize the development of the concept of \"magic\" in Western thought, and go on to examine case studies that illuminate the contemporary significance of supernatural beliin different socio-cultural locations. Topics will include the relationship of magic and modernity in colonial and postcolonial contexts; the representation omagical modernities in literary movements such as \"magical realism\"; the magic of cinema; and the place of magical belief in the contemporary United States. Texts will include works by Mary Douglas, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Carlo GinzburgGabriel Garc?a M?rquez, J. K. Rowling, Michael Taussig, Keith Thomas, Max Weberand others. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MAGICAL MODERNITIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3748/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.39", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "MAGICAL MODERNITIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-025-301", "path": "/courses/3748/sections/301", "id": "3748-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-025-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/3748/sections/301/reviews/2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY", "first_name": "KATHERINE", "last_name": "RAMSEY", "id": "2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY", "name": "KATHERINE RAMSEY"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "3748-301-2048-KATHERINE-RAMSEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-025", "path": "/courses/3748", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3748/sections", "values": [{"name": "MAGICAL MODERNITIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-025-301", "path": "/courses/3748/sections/301", "id": "3748-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-025-301"]}]}, "id": 3748, "aliases": ["ANTH-025"]}
