{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/138"}, "description": "Cognitive anthropology is the study of how people in social groups conceive of objects and events in their world. It provides a framework for understanding how illness and treatment are categorized by members of different groups. It also helps to explain why risk perception, helpseeking behavior, and disease outcomes vary among populations. This seminar will explore the history of cognitive anthropology, schema theory, connectionism, and the role of cultural models. Methods for identifying cultural models will be discussed and practiced. Implications for health communication will be emphasized. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "COG ANTH,HEALTH&ILLNESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/138/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.92", "rReadingsValue": "3.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.23", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.46"}, "section": {"name": "COG ANTH,HEALTH&ILLNESS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-410-301", "path": "/courses/138/sections/301", "id": "138-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-410-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/138/sections/301/reviews/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "first_name": "FRANCES K.", "last_name": "BARG", "id": "115-FRANCES-K--BARG", "name": "FRANCES K.
