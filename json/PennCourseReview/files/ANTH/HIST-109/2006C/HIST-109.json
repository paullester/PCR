{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2307"}, "description": "Americans have long been fascinated with The West. Yet, what and even where that West was has changed over the centuries. This course will survey the historical development of the American West as an environment, culture, economy, and society but we will also study it as an American myth. Although the course will span the sixteenth century to the present, emphasis will be on the period since the California Gold Rush. Major themes will include American expansion, the role of the federal government, challenges of western natures, American Indian societies, migration and settlement, ethnicity and immigration,economic development, tourism, and popular culture. We will explore these topics through a variety of sources, including scholarly texts, documents, diaries, fiction, and film. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "THE AMERICAN WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9048/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "2.48", "rRecommendMajor": "2.90", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "2.90", "rInstructorQuality": "2.81"}, "section": {"name": "THE AMERICAN WEST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-109-001", "path": "/courses/9048/sections/001", "id": "9048-001", "aliases": ["HIST-109-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/9048/sections/001/reviews/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "first_name": "PHOEBE S", "last_name": "KROPP", "id": "641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP", "name": "PHOEBE S KROPP"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "9048-001-641-PHOEBE-S-KROPP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-109", "path": "/courses/9048", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9048/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE AMERICAN WEST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-109-001", "path": "/courses/9048/sections/001", "id": "9048-001", "aliases": ["HIST-109-001"]}]}, "id": 9048, "aliases": ["HIST-109"]}
