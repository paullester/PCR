{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1654"}, "description": "Examination of sociocultural 'registers' of language namely linguistic varieties specific to particular social practices and institutions. Topics include registers of scientific language, religious language, professional language (as in law, bureaucracy, medicine or business), formal and etiquette-laden speech, magical incantation, secret languages, thieves' argot, standardized 'national' languages, and slang.
