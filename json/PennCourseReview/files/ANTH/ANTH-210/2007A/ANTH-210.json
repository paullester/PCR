{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3993"}, "description": "This course will cover the topic of DEATH from a bio/cultural perspective including the evolution of life history (aging and demography - mortality) as well as from an archaeological perspective (prehistory) and early history of mortuary practices. Nothing in the lifespan of humans is so revealing on the interface of culture and biology as is death and the experience of death. This course is not concerned specifically with how an individual experiences death, but in the ways that culture and biology have come to define and deal with physical death and the death experience. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "DEATH: ANTHRO PERSPECTIV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14061/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.04", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.30", "rCommAbility": "3.48", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "DEATH: ANTHRO PERSPECTIV", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANTH-210-001", "path": "/courses/14061/sections/001", "id": "14061-001", "aliases": ["ANTH-210-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/14061/sections/001/reviews/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/97-JANET-M--MONGE", "first_name": "JANET M.", "last_name": "MONGE", "id": "97-JANET-M--MONGE", "name": "JANET M.
