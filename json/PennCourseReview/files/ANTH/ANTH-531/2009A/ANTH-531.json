{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4155"}, "description": "This course analyzes changes of Chinese culture and society since the \"liberalization\" of China by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949. More specifically, this course traces in detail the changes of Chinese family and kinship, which have been the social and ideological backbone of Chinese society. During the first half of this course we deal with the dominant social organizations, practices and ideaologies of the pre-revolutionary Chinese society. During the latter half of this course, we analyze the social movements and policies of the CCP and their impacts on the everyday life of Chinese people. \n\nWe will discuss, for example, the origins and specific policies of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and their effects on the lineage and family. This course deals with land collectivization, anti-superstition campaigns, marriage reforms, \"praise of youth\", and their multiple influences on the traditional hierarchy based on age and gender differences. About the changes after Mao, we will discuss internal migration and inheritance patterns, the agricultural responsibility system and household economies, emerging capitalist labor market and gender roles, the single-child family policy and the invention of \"childhood\", increasing popularity of neolocality and the triumph of conjugality. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "CHINESE CULTURE &SOCIETY: Changes and continuities under socialism and post-socialism", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15329/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.86", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "CHINESE CULTURE &SOCIETY: Changes and continuities under socialism and post-socialism", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-531-301", "path": "/courses/15329/sections/301", "id": "15329-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-531-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/15329/sections/301/reviews/4238-JAESOK-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4238-JAESOK-KIM", "first_name": "JAESOK", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "4238-JAESOK-KIM", "name": "JAESOK KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "15329-301-4238-JAESOK-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-531", "path": "/courses/15329", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15329/sections", "values": [{"name": "CHINESE CULTURE &SOCIETY: Changes and continuities under socialism and post-socialism", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-531-301", "path": "/courses/15329/sections/301", "id": "15329-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-531-301"]}]}, "id": 15329, "aliases": ["ANTH-531"]}
