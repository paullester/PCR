This marriage of two sub disciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology, psychology, and primate ethology, as we try to understand the origins of language, culture, and our unique physical characteristics. In this course, two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution, describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations. \r\n\r\nOverall students considered the course to be \u201cinformation packed and enriching.\u201d Students reported that they learned \u201cnew and interesting things,\u201d and a few were \u201cinspired.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents praised Dr. Olszewski as \u201ccommitted to her students\u201d and \u201cnever short on support.\u201d Although students considered Professor Olszeweski a \u201cwealth of knowledge,\u201d some students would have preferred more opportunities to discuss the reading.\r\n\r\nStudents reported that the \u201cworkload was fair as were the tests and quizzes\u201d and the \u201cgrading was easy\u201d with a manageable number of assignments.\r\n\r\n", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/22615/sections/601/reviews/86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI", "first_name": "DEBORAH IRENE", "last_name": "OLSZEWSKI", "id": "86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI", "name": "DEBORAH IRENE OLSZEWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "22615-601-86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI"}]
