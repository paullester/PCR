This marriage of two subdisciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology, psychology, and primate ethology, as we try to understand the origins of language, culture, and our unique physical characteristics.  In this course, two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution, describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations.\r\n\r\nStudents described this as a rather \u201cbasic requirement-fulfilling course\u201d that had a lot of material to cover. Although the subject matter could be considered \u201cdry\u201d at times, almost all of the students said that the course was made \u201cinteresting by the professor.\u201d Mostly, the students agreed that the course content was manageable.\r\n\r\nProfessor Olszewski was the reason many students enjoyed this course. Her \u201ceclectic\u201d nature and \u201cextreme enthusiasm\u201d about the subject material made a potentially boring class very exciting. She was described as \u201cextremely kind and approachable\u201d and her grading policies to be \u201cvery fair.\u201d Her \u201cgreat attitude\u201d made the course worthwhile. \r\n\r\nStudents agreed that anthropology majors would get more out of this course than non-majors, but that it was a good course to fulfill the Humanities and Natural Sciences sector. Students felt that they left the course with at least a basic understanding of prehistory and human evolution.", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/26944/sections/001/reviews/86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI", "first_name": "DEBORAH IRENE", "last_name": "OLSZEWSKI", "id": "86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI", "name": "DEBORAH IRENE OLSZEWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "26944-001-86-DEBORAH-IRENE-OLSZEWSKI"}]
