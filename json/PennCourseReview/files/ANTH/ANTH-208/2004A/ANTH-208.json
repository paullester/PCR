{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2723"}, "description": "This course will trace the history of the use of archaeological knowledge for political needs leading up to present day - where in 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India was brought in to 'scientifically' prove subjective histories, myth, and belief systems. How do such state sponsored knowledge productions effect national discourse; how do public narratives interact with private discourse about such topics of communal violence; how do politicians use and abuse such discourses - especially in election years; and how does this effect the practice of archaeology in India and on an international level. Topics will include, Ayodhya, the Indus/Sarasvati debate, the Vedic Harappans, Indo-european languages, the Cambay Civilization, Adam's Bridge, etc. This course will be a combination of lectures and seminar style discussions. Students will be required to handle literature from archaeology, anthropology, political science and history. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "POLITICS OF THE PAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6148/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "POLITICS OF THE PAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-208-401", "path": "/courses/6148/sections/401", "id": "6148-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-208-401", "SARS-237-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/6148/sections/401/reviews/101-UZMA-Z-RIZVI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/101-UZMA-Z-RIZVI", "first_name": "UZMA Z", "last_name": "RIZVI", "id": "101-UZMA-Z-RIZVI", "name": "UZMA Z RIZVI"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "6148-401-101-UZMA-Z-RIZVI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-208", "path": "/courses/6148", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6148/sections", "values": [{"name": "POLITICS OF THE PAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-208-401", "path": "/courses/6148/sections/401", "id": "6148-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-208-401", "SARS-237-401"]}]}, "id": 6148, "aliases": ["ANTH-208", "SARS-237"]}
