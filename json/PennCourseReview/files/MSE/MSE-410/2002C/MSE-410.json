{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2004"}, "description": "The information age is enabled by devices that manipulate, store, transmit and exchange \"data\" in the broadest sense of the term. These devices function based on fundamental principles of materials science. Current technologies are limited by and future technologes enabled by materials issues. This course is an integration of materials science fundamentals (structural, electronic, magnetic, chemical and thermodynamiic properties) and material families (metals, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics) with specific application to materials-critical aspects of information technology. The format includes lab modules, outside speakers, and a group project. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "MATLS FOR INFO TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3264/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.75", "rCommAbility": "1.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "MATLS FOR INFO TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-410-001", "path": "/courses/3264/sections/001", "id": "3264-001", "aliases": ["MSE-410-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/3264/sections/001/reviews/230-DAWN-A-BONNELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/230-DAWN-A-BONNELL", "first_name": "DAWN A", "last_name": "BONNELL", "id": "230-DAWN-A-BONNELL", "name": "DAWN A BONNELL"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "3264-001-230-DAWN-A-BONNELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-410", "path": "/courses/3264", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3264/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATLS FOR INFO TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-410-001", "path": "/courses/3264/sections/001", "id": "3264-001", "aliases": ["MSE-410-001"]}]}, "id": 3264, "aliases": ["MSE-410"]}
