{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5445"}, "description": "This course is designed to provide an understanding of the corrosion principles and the engineering methods used to minimize and prevent corrosion. Metals and alloys are emphasized because these are the materials in which corrosion is the most prevalent. Aqueous environments are also emphasized these are the common corrosion conditions. \n\nIn the first half of the course, the impact and electrochemical nature of the corrosion are described, and then the corrosion fundamentals (electrochemical reactions, phase (pourbaix) diagrams, aqueous corrosion kinetics, passivity, and high-temperature oxidation) are emphasized. The forms of corrosion (galvanic, pitting and crevice, environmentally induced cracking) and corrosion in the human body (for example, surgical implants and prosthetic devices) and in other selective environments (concrete, seawater, and water solutions containing dissolved salts, sulfur, and bacteria) are also described in the second half. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ENVIRONMENTL DEGRADATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27825/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.59", "rDifficulty": "1.35", "rStimulateInterest": "2.65", "rRecommendMajor": "2.65", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "1.35", "rInstructorAccess": "1.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.72"}, "section": {"name": "ENVIRONMENTL DEGRADATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-555-001", "path": "/courses/27825/sections/001", "id": "27825-001", "aliases": ["MSE-555-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/27825/sections/001/reviews/4457-WILLIAM-M--KANE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4457-WILLIAM-M--KANE", "first_name": "WILLIAM M.", "last_name": "KANE", "id": "4457-WILLIAM-M--KANE", "name": "WILLIAM M.
