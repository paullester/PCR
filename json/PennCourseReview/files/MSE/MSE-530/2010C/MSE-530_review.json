The main topics covered include: reaction equilibria in multicomponent systems; free energies of mixing solutions, liquids, solids, and polymers; binary and ternary phase diagrams; surfaces and interfaces.\r\n\r\nAlthough some students enjoyed the course material, many others questioned its applicability, with one characterizing it as \u201cway off base from a grad level engineering perspective.\u201d The content was \u201chighly theoretical,\u201d strongly emphasizing mathematical arguments and derivations over application. Another student pointed out that the material was above the level of most students.\r\n\r\nMost students regarded Professor Li as a very enthusiastic instructor, and he was also described as \u201ckind and knowledgeable.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents generally described the course as very difficult and fast-paced. According to most, homework assignments were very time-consuming. This course is a requirement for a graduate level program.
