It includes a classification of materials for energy\r\napplications involving generation, transmission, and storage of electricity; current and\r\nfuture uses of fossil fuels, with emphasis on higher efficiency uses of fossil fuels and \"all\r\nelectric\" applications (e.g. transportation and power generation) and new materials as\r\ntechnology enablers for future energy sources: nuclear, fuel cells, solar, wind.\r\nMany students stated that they thought the course material was extremely\r\ninteresting but a few students complained that the lecture notes were \u201cunprofessional,\u201d\r\n\u201cchaotic,\u201d and \u201cunoriginal.\u201d\r\nMany students appreciated his emails stating current topics in energy storage\r\ntechnology. Some students complained that he was very involved in his research and did\r\nnot have much time to see students outside of class.\r\nThis class is meant for seniors or graduate students in the materials science\r\nengineering department. However, this class can be taken by any engineer and was\r\n\u201chighly recommended to anyone wanting a good overview of energy technology.\u201d\r\nOnly 7 students submitted written reviews for this class.", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/24808/sections/001/reviews/4041-CHRISTOPHER-B--MURRAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4041-CHRISTOPHER-B--MURRAY", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER B.", "last_name": "MURRAY", "id": "4041-CHRISTOPHER-B--MURRAY", "name": "CHRISTOPHER B.
