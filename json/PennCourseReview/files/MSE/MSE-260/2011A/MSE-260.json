This course will cover the fundamentals of classical thermodynamics as applied to the calculation and prediction of phase stability, chemical reactivity and synthesis of materials systems. The size-dependent properties of nano-sized systems will be explored through the incorporation of the thermodynamic properties of surfaces. The prediction of the phase stability of two and three component systems will be illustrated through the calculation and interpretation of phase diagrams for metallic, semiconductor, inorganic, polymeric and surfactant systems. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MACRO&NANO-SCALE MATLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22106/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "3.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.05", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.62", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58"}, "section": {"name": "MACRO&NANO-SCALE MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-260-001", "path": "/courses/22106/sections/001", "id": "22106-001", "aliases": ["MSE-260-001"]}, "comments": "This course covers the basic principles of chemical thermodynamics as they are applied to macro and nano-sized materials.

Students also thought that Professor Davies was \u201chonest in his criticism\u201d and was readily available to answer any questions.&#8232;&#8232;Students generally felt that this was a hard course that included very difficult exams. As a result, students spent a lot of time studying for this class.
