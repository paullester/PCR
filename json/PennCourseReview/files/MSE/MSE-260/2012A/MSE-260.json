{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/775"}, "description": "Basic principles of chemical thermodynamics as applied to macro and nano-sized materials. This course will cover the fundamentals of classical thermodynamics as applied to the calculation and prediction of phase stability, chemical reactivity and synthesis of materials systems. The size-dependent properties of nano-sized systems will be explored through the incorporation of the thermodynamic properties of surfaces. The prediction of the phase stability of two and three component systems will be illustrated through the calculation and interpretation of phase diagrams for metallic, semiconductor, inorganic, polymeric and surfactant systems. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "MACRO&NANO-SCALE MATLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27818/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.42", "rDifficulty": "3.06", "rStimulateInterest": "3.12", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.48", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.03", "rCommAbility": "3.34", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "MACRO&NANO-SCALE MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-260-001", "path": "/courses/27818/sections/001", "id": "27818-001", "aliases": ["MSE-260-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/27818/sections/001/reviews/839-PETER-K-DAVIES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/839-PETER-K-DAVIES", "first_name": "PETER K", "last_name": "DAVIES", "id": "839-PETER-K-DAVIES", "name": "PETER K DAVIES"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "27818-001-839-PETER-K-DAVIES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-260", "path": "/courses/27818", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27818/sections", "values": [{"name": "MACRO&NANO-SCALE MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-260-001", "path": "/courses/27818/sections/001", "id": "27818-001", "aliases": ["MSE-260-001"]}]}, "id": 27818, "aliases": ["MSE-260"]}
