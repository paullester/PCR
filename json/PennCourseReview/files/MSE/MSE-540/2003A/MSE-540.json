In this course, the science of such structural transitions is treated. The topics discussed include introduction to statistical mechanics, theory of nucleation and growth kinetics, solidification, diffusionless solid state transformations, and microscopic theory of phase transition. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "PHASE TRANSFORMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1948/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-540", "path": "/courses/1948", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1948/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHASE TRANSFORMATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-540-001", "path": "/courses/1948/sections/001", "id": "1948-001", "aliases": ["MSE-540-001"]}]}, "id": 1948, "aliases": ["MSE-540"]}
