{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/777"}, "description": "The infrastructure and transportation industries provide the backbone upon which the modern economy is built. This course is designed to provide the student with an understanding of the classes of materials, materials design considerations and materials formation processes that underlie these vital segments of the world economy. The course contains two related streams, classroom lectures and team-based design projects. In the lectures, key materials properties that govern the utility of structural components will be covered, with detailed treatment of the concepts of plastic flow and fracture of structural materials. Through the design projects, students will conduct separate mini-projects on materials selection for specific applications using database approaches, failure analysis, and process modeling. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "MATS FOR INFRASTRUCTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/777/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "MATS FOR INFRASTRUCTURES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-420-001", "path": "/courses/777/sections/001", "id": "777-001", "aliases": ["MSE-420-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/777/sections/001/reviews/841-DAVID-E-LUZZI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/841-DAVID-E-LUZZI", "first_name": "DAVID E", "last_name": "LUZZI", "id": "841-DAVID-E-LUZZI", "name": "DAVID E LUZZI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "777-001-841-DAVID-E-LUZZI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-420", "path": "/courses/777", "sections": {"path": "/courses/777/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATS FOR INFRASTRUCTURES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-420-001", "path": "/courses/777/sections/001", "id": "777-001", "aliases": ["MSE-420-001"]}]}, "id": 777, "aliases": ["MSE-420"]}
