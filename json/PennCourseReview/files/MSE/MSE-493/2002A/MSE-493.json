{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/780"}, "description": "This course has been designed to bridge the gap between theory and applications. This course has several broad goals: (1) demonstrate how fundamental materials science principles underlie materials applications in a range of industries (e.g., information storage, sports, biotechnology); (2) Develop the students' ability to understand the relationship between the performance of a device and the materials/processes that make up the device; and (3) learn how to make trade-offs between performance, processing and cost, and understand te wider implications about such trade-offs. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/780/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-493-001", "path": "/courses/780/sections/001", "id": "780-001", "aliases": ["MSE-493-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/780/sections/001/reviews/836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "first_name": "RUSSELL JOHN", "last_name": "COMPOSTO", "id": "836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "name": "RUSSELL JOHN COMPOSTO"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "780-001-836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.33"}, "section": {"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-493-001", "path": "/courses/780/sections/001", "id": "780-001", "aliases": ["MSE-493-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/780/sections/001/reviews/837-TAKESHI-EGAMI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/837-TAKESHI-EGAMI", "first_name": "TAKESHI", "last_name": "EGAMI", "id": "837-TAKESHI-EGAMI", "name": "TAKESHI EGAMI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "780-001-837-TAKESHI-EGAMI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-493", "path": "/courses/780", "sections": {"path": "/courses/780/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-493-001", "path": "/courses/780/sections/001", "id": "780-001", "aliases": ["MSE-493-001"]}]}, "id": 780, "aliases": ["MSE-493"]}
