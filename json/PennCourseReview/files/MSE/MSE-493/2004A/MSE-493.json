{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/780"}, "description": "This course has been designed to bridge the gap between theory and applications. This course has several broad goals: (1) demonstrate how fundamental materials science principles underlie materials applications in a range of industries (e.g., information storage, sports, biotechnology); (2) Develop the students' ability to understand the relationship between the performance of a device and the materials/processes that make up the device; and (3) learn how to make trade-offs between performance, processing and cost, and understand te wider implications about such trade-offs. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6859/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-493-001", "path": "/courses/6859/sections/001", "id": "6859-001", "aliases": ["MSE-493-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/6859/sections/001/reviews/1618-I-WEI-CHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1618-I-WEI-CHEN", "first_name": "I-WEI", "last_name": "CHEN", "id": "1618-I-WEI-CHEN", "name": "I-WEI CHEN"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "6859-001-1618-I-WEI-CHEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-493", "path": "/courses/6859", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6859/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-493-001", "path": "/courses/6859/sections/001", "id": "6859-001", "aliases": ["MSE-493-001"]}]}, "id": 6859, "aliases": ["MSE-493"]}
