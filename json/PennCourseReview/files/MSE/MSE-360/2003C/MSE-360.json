{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2003"}, "description": "Basic principles of material structure and organization from nano to macro sizes. This course will cover the fundamentals of materials structure including the crystalline, liquid crystalline and glassy states as well as 1-D, 2-D and 3-D structure and defects. Examples will be used from the different classes of materials - metallic, semiconductor, inorganic, polymeric - with particular emphasis on important components of structure on the nanoscale including particles, surfaces, interfaces and defects. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "STRUCTURE OF MATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4430/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "1.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.70", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.30"}, "section": {"name": "STRUCTURE OF MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-360-001", "path": "/courses/4430/sections/001", "id": "4430-001", "aliases": ["MSE-360-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/4430/sections/001/reviews/841-DAVID-E-LUZZI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/841-DAVID-E-LUZZI", "first_name": "DAVID E", "last_name": "LUZZI", "id": "841-DAVID-E-LUZZI", "name": "DAVID E LUZZI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "4430-001-841-DAVID-E-LUZZI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-360", "path": "/courses/4430", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4430/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRUCTURE OF MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-360-001", "path": "/courses/4430/sections/001", "id": "4430-001", "aliases": ["MSE-360-001"]}]}, "id": 4430, "aliases": ["MSE-360"]}
