This course will cover the fundamentals of materials structure including the crystalline, liquid crystalline and glassy states as well as 1-D, 2-D and 3-D structure and defects. Examples will be used from the different classes of materials - metallic, semiconductor, inorganic, polymeric - with particular emphasis on important components of structure on the nanoscale including particles, surfaces, interfaces and defects. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "STRCTRE AT THE NANOSCALE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17749/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.31", "rDifficulty": "3.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.81", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.77", "rCommAbility": "1.81", "rInstructorQuality": "2.18"}, "section": {"name": "STRCTRE AT THE NANOSCALE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-360-001", "path": "/courses/17749/sections/001", "id": "17749-001", "aliases": ["MSE-360-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/17749/sections/001/reviews/4041-CHRISTOPHER-B--MURRAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4041-CHRISTOPHER-B--MURRAY", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER B.", "last_name": "MURRAY", "id": "4041-CHRISTOPHER-B--MURRAY", "name": "CHRISTOPHER B.
