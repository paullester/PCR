{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3171"}, "description": "Throughout mankind's history, materials have played a critical role in civilization and technology. The selection of materials has been based on availability and functionality. The rapid advances of materials technologies in the last 150 years, however, have made nearly all classes and forms of materials available, at a cost. Therefore, in theory at least, materials selection can now proceed on a rational basis as an optimization process. In this course, we will focus on structural applications where mechanical design is central. By the end of the course, the students can expect to acquire a level of engineering familiarity with a broad range of materials, and be prepared to undertake material design projects in the future. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8063/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-393-001", "path": "/courses/8063/sections/001", "id": "8063-001", "aliases": ["MSE-393-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/8063/sections/001/reviews/1618-I-WEI-CHEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1618-I-WEI-CHEN", "first_name": "I-WEI", "last_name": "CHEN", "id": "1618-I-WEI-CHEN", "name": "I-WEI CHEN"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "8063-001-1618-I-WEI-CHEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-393", "path": "/courses/8063", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8063/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATERIALS SELECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-393-001", "path": "/courses/8063/sections/001", "id": "8063-001", "aliases": ["MSE-393-001"]}]}, "id": 8063, "aliases": ["MSE-393"]}
