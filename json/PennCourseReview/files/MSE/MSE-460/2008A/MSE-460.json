{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2630"}, "description": "This course will cover fundamentals of atomic level modeling of the structure and properties of materials. Specifically it will cover metals, semiconductors, oxides and other ionic crystals. First, the description of atomic interactions will be introduced. This will include both basics of the density functional theory and approximations in terms of pair potentials, embedded atom method and tight-binding. The methods of computer modeling include molecular statics, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo and lattice dynamics (phonons). Interpretations of results of such modeling in terms of structures, for example using the radial distribution function, thermodynamic and statistical physics analyses will be an important component of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "COMPUTATIONAL MATLS SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20524/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-460", "path": "/courses/20524", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20524/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMPUTATIONAL MATLS SCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-460-001", "path": "/courses/20524/sections/001", "id": "20524-001", "aliases": ["MSE-460-001"]}]}, "id": 20524, "aliases": ["MSE-460"]}
