{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1409"}, "description": "The course will focus on the various approaches to make nanostructures including nanotubes, wires, quantum dots, patterned devices. The lab component of the course includes synthesis of nanoparticles and tubes, sintering and mass transport, colloidal stabilization and hybrid tunneling devices and nanolithography. For each case fundamental concepts are presented, lab results are discussed and compared to prevailing theories. Measurement tools utilized are chemical synthesis, chemical vapor deposition, e-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electronic transport probes. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PROC OF NANOSTRUC MATLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6862/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-565", "path": "/courses/6862", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6862/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROC OF NANOSTRUC MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-565-001", "path": "/courses/6862/sections/001", "id": "6862-001", "aliases": ["MSE-565-001"]}]}, "id": 6862, "aliases": ["MSE-565"]}
