{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4354"}, "description": "This course will provide an overview of select topics in equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The emphasis will be on elucidating the basic postulates of statistical mechanics, explaining its fundamental laws and introducing the methodology of non-equilibrium processes via select applications in diverse fields. Statistical Mechanics is a unique branch of physics that permeates our understanding of matter at all length scales, from nanometers to stellar dimensions, and ranging in temperatures from nano-Kelvin to billions of degrees Kelvin. The techniques of Statistical Mechanics have been employed in condensed matter physics and materials science when studying solids, liquids, and gases as well as in other disciplines such as biology, zoology, molecular biology, physiology, economics, signal transmission and large scale networks such as the world-wide web. It is envisaged that students at Penn and especially in MSE/SEAS will benefit by getting a perspective of this fascinating subject and appreciate how its principles govern phenomena as diverse as semiconductor devices, greenhouse effect, biological pattern formation and instabilities on material surfaces. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "STATISTICAL MECHANICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27828/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "STATISTICAL MECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-575-001", "path": "/courses/27828/sections/001", "id": "27828-001", "aliases": ["MSE-575-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/27828/sections/001/reviews/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "first_name": "MAHADEVAN", "last_name": "KHANTHA", "id": "3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "name": "MAHADEVAN KHANTHA"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "27828-001-3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-575", "path": "/courses/27828", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27828/sections", "values": [{"name": "STATISTICAL MECHANICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-575-001", "path": "/courses/27828/sections/001", "id": "27828-001", "aliases": ["MSE-575-001"]}]}, "id": 27828, "aliases": ["MSE-575"]}
