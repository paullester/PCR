{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2009"}, "description": "Advanced polymer physics includes the topics of polymer chain statistics, thermodynamics, rubber elasticity, polymer morphology, fracture, and chain relaxation. Rigorous derivations of select theories will be presented along with experimental results for comparison. Special topics, such as liquid crystalline polymers, blends and copolymers, will be presented throughout the course. Special topics, such as liquid crystallinity, nanostructures, and biopolymer diffusion, will be investigated by teams of students using the current literature as a resource. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "ADVANCED POLYMER TOPCIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3269/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.92", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED POLYMER TOPCIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-581-001", "path": "/courses/3269/sections/001", "id": "3269-001", "aliases": ["MSE-581-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/3269/sections/001/reviews/836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "first_name": "RUSSELL JOHN", "last_name": "COMPOSTO", "id": "836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO", "name": "RUSSELL JOHN COMPOSTO"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "3269-001-836-RUSSELL-JOHN-COMPOSTO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-581", "path": "/courses/3269", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3269/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED POLYMER TOPCIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-581-001", "path": "/courses/3269/sections/001", "id": "3269-001", "aliases": ["MSE-581-001"]}]}, "id": 3269, "aliases": ["MSE-581"]}
