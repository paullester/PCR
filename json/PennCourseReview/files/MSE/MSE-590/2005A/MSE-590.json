{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2344"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to study the fundamental physics of the interaction of ions, electrons, photons, and neutrons with matter. A second objective is to use the products of these interactions to characterize the atomic (or molecular) structure, composition, and defects of a semiconductor, ceramic, polymer, composite, or metal. Ion beam techniques will include Rutherford backscattering and forward recoil spectrometry, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. Electron probe techniques will include x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Neutron techniques will include neutron reflectivity. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique will be discussed. Examples will be drawn from metallurgy, electronic materials, polymer science, ceramic science, archaeology, and biology. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "SURF&THIN FILM ANLY TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10729/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.90", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "SURF&THIN FILM ANLY TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-590-001", "path": "/courses/10729/sections/001", "id": "10729-001", "aliases": ["MSE-590-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/10729/sections/001/reviews/230-DAWN-A-BONNELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/230-DAWN-A-BONNELL", "first_name": "DAWN A", "last_name": "BONNELL", "id": "230-DAWN-A-BONNELL", "name": "DAWN A BONNELL"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "10729-001-230-DAWN-A-BONNELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-590", "path": "/courses/10729", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10729/sections", "values": [{"name": "SURF&THIN FILM ANLY TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-590-001", "path": "/courses/10729/sections/001", "id": "10729-001", "aliases": ["MSE-590-001"]}]}, "id": 10729, "aliases": ["MSE-590"]}
