{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/774"}, "description": "The course provides an in-depth experimental introduction to key concepts in materials and the relationships between nanoscale structure, the properties and performance. The use of laboratory methods to examine the structure of materials, to measure the important properties, and to investigate the relationship between structure and properties is covered. Emphasis is placed on a complete exposure of Nano and Materials science as a field. Most experiments require multiple laboratory sessions, with priority given to experiments in which students explore the entire range of materials science, from the synthesis of materials and the characterization of structure, thermodynamics and composition, to the measurement of properties and discussion of applications. Students are able to realize working devices as an end product of the key laboratories in this course. Practice in oral and written communication is realized through course assignments. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "STRUC/PROP OF ALLOYS-LAB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1943/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "2.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "STRUC/PROP OF ALLOYS-LAB", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-250-001", "path": "/courses/1943/sections/001", "id": "1943-001", "aliases": ["MSE-250-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/1943/sections/001/reviews/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "first_name": "DAVID P", "last_name": "POPE", "id": "835-DAVID-P-POPE", "name": "DAVID P POPE"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "1943-001-835-DAVID-P-POPE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-250", "path": "/courses/1943", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1943/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRUC/PROP OF ALLOYS-LAB", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-250-001", "path": "/courses/1943/sections/001", "id": "1943-001", "aliases": ["MSE-250-001"]}]}, "id": 1943, "aliases": ["MSE-250"]}
