One-electron band structure models: nearly free electrons, tight binding. Semiclassical dynamics and transport. Cohesive energy, lattice dynamic and phonons. Dielectric properties of insulators. Homogeneous semiconductors and p-n junctions. Experimental probes of solid state phenomena; photoemission, energy loss spectroscopy, neutron scattering. As time permits, special topics selected from the following: correlation effects, semiconductor alloys and heterostructures, amorphous semiconductors, electro-active polymers. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16138/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.67", "rCommAbility": "1.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-571-001", "path": "/courses/16138/sections/001", "id": "16138-001", "aliases": ["MSE-571-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/16138/sections/001/reviews/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "first_name": "MAHADEVAN", "last_name": "KHANTHA", "id": "3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "name": "MAHADEVAN KHANTHA"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "16138-001-3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-571", "path": "/courses/16138", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16138/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-571-001", "path": "/courses/16138/sections/001", "id": "16138-001", "aliases": ["MSE-571-001"]}]}, "id": 16138, "aliases": ["MSE-571"]}
