{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/773"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the science of functional materials in the context of applications. This course assumes an introductory knowledge of physics and chemstry and is aimed at undergraduates in physical engineering programs as well as physics and chemistry. Functional materials are the \"brains\" behind high technology applications found in many electronics, telecommunications and biomedical industries. The goal of this course is to provide a fundamental understanding of the synthesis, processing, structure and property behavior of functional materials. The performance and utilization of these materials will also be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1942/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-222-001", "path": "/courses/1942/sections/001", "id": "1942-001", "aliases": ["MSE-222-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/1942/sections/001/reviews/837-TAKESHI-EGAMI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/837-TAKESHI-EGAMI", "first_name": "TAKESHI", "last_name": "EGAMI", "id": "837-TAKESHI-EGAMI", "name": "TAKESHI EGAMI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "1942-001-837-TAKESHI-EGAMI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-222", "path": "/courses/1942", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1942/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-222-001", "path": "/courses/1942/sections/001", "id": "1942-001", "aliases": ["MSE-222-001"]}]}, "id": 1942, "aliases": ["MSE-222"]}
