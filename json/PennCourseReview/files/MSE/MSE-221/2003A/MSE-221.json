{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/772"}, "description": "The course is directed at the development of a background in basic physics required to understand the behavior of electrons in atoms, molecules and solids. Examples to illustrate the application of these techniques will be centered in the free and nearly free electron theory of solids. The application of modern physics to many state-of-the-art materials analysis techniques will be demonstrated throughout the course. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "QUANTUM PHYS OF MATLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "QUANTUM PHYS OF MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-221-001", "path": "/courses/1941/sections/001", "id": "1941-001", "aliases": ["MSE-221-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/1941/sections/001/reviews/156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "first_name": "WILLIAM R", "last_name": "GRAHAM", "id": "156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "name": "WILLIAM R GRAHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "1941-001-156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-221", "path": "/courses/1941", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1941/sections", "values": [{"name": "QUANTUM PHYS OF MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-221-001", "path": "/courses/1941/sections/001", "id": "1941-001", "aliases": ["MSE-221-001"]}]}, "id": 1941, "aliases": ["MSE-221"]}
