Registration for recitation is also required.\r\n\r\nStudents generally reported learning a lot of useful information from this course, though some wished that more material could have been covered. The textbook used in this course was praised for being \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201cgood at breaking down the material.\u201d\r\n\r\nLikewise, Professor Khantha was described as an \u201cengaging and energetic\u201d teacher who \u201cknows this subject inside and out\u201d and \u201csincerely wants students to learn.\u201d One student proclaimed that \u201cyou can tell right away that Professor Khantha extremely enjoys her subject and is eager to pass the knowledge onto us.\u201d A few students found the professor difficult to understand at times, but many fel that the TAs and textbook were very helpful in breaking down the material covered in lectures.\r\n\r\nMost students felt that the material was conceptually difficult and demanded a lot of time to fully understand. Students generally thought that the exams were \u201cvery difficult and definitely required a lot of set aside study time.\u201d PHYS 150 and MATH 240 should be taken concurrently, although some students felt that those who take MATH 240 concurrently had more difficulty understanding some of the eigenvalue concepts. This course meets the Natural Science Requirement as an alternative to PHYS 240 and counts towards the MSE minor.\r\n", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/23471/sections/001/reviews/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "first_name": "MAHADEVAN", "last_name": "KHANTHA", "id": "3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "name": "MAHADEVAN KHANTHA"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "23471-001-3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-221", "path": "/courses/23471", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23471/sections", "values": [{"name": "QUANTUM PHYS OF MATLS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-221-001", "path": "/courses/23471/sections/001", "id": "23471-001", "aliases": ["MSE-221-001"]}]}, "id": 23471, "aliases": ["MSE-221"]}
