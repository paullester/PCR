{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2627"}, "description": "The purpose of this first course in the major is to introduce the student to key concepts underlying the design, properties and processing of nanoscale functional materials, and how they are employed in practical applications. Fundamental chemical and physical principles underlying the properties of electronic, dielectric and magnetic materials will be developed in the context of metals, semiconductors, insulators, crystals, glasses, polymers and ceramics. Miniaturization and the nanotechnology revolution confronts materials science with limitations and opportunities; examples in which nanoscale materials are really different from our macro world experience will be explored. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "INTRO NANOSCALE MATL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8059/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.42", "rDifficulty": "2.96", "rStimulateInterest": "1.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "1.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.15", "rInstructorAccess": "2.65", "rReadingsValue": "1.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.76", "rCommAbility": "1.04", "rInstructorQuality": "1.54"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO NANOSCALE MATL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-215-001", "path": "/courses/8059/sections/001", "id": "8059-001", "aliases": ["MSE-215-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/8059/sections/001/reviews/840-JOHN-E-FISCHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/840-JOHN-E-FISCHER", "first_name": "JOHN E", "last_name": "FISCHER", "id": "840-JOHN-E-FISCHER", "name": "JOHN E FISCHER"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "8059-001-840-JOHN-E-FISCHER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-215", "path": "/courses/8059", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8059/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO NANOSCALE MATL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MSE-215-001", "path": "/courses/8059/sections/001", "id": "8059-001", "aliases": ["MSE-215-001"]}]}, "id": 8059, "aliases": ["MSE-215"]}
