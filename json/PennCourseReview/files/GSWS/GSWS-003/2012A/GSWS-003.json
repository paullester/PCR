{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5423"}, "description": "This course surveys the history and recent developments in sexuality studies and queer thought. We will begin with a foundation in sexuality studies and queer thought by reading some inaugural texts in the field. We will then turn to critical engagements between queer theory and four intimately related subject areas: Feminist Studies, Critical Race Studies, Transgender Studies and Disability Studies. Taking this intersectional approach will enable an analysis of the relationship between queer theory and other modes of inquiry that critique forms of power, priviledge, marginality and social norms. The final section of the course examines queer theory from a present and future vantage through the frames of citizenship and nationalism, transnationalism and globalization, hetro- and homonormativity, criminalization of queerness, as well as queer times, places and futures. We will conclude by asking: \"What's so queer (or not so queer) about Queer Studies today?\" \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SXLTY STUD & QUEER THRY: Sexuality Studies & Queer Theory", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27520/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.80", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SXLTY STUD & QUEER THRY: Sexuality Studies & Queer Theory", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GSWS-003-001", "path": "/courses/27520/sections/001", "id": "27520-001", "aliases": ["GSWS-003-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/27520/sections/001/reviews/6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER", "first_name": "BENJAMIN", "last_name": "SINGER", "id": "6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER", "name": "BENJAMIN SINGER"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "27520-001-6105-BENJAMIN-SINGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSWS-003", "path": "/courses/27520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27520/sections", "values": [{"name": "SXLTY STUD & QUEER THRY: Sexuality Studies & Queer Theory", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GSWS-003-001", "path": "/courses/27520/sections/001", "id": "27520-001", "aliases": ["GSWS-003-001"]}]}, "id": 27520, "aliases": ["GSWS-003"]}
