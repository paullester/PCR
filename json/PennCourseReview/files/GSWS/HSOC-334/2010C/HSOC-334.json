{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5128"}, "description": "How we are born and give birth can vary more than most people realize. Until the rise of medical technology, women gave birth at home surrounded by other women. Now, the majority of Americans are born in hospitals, and a large percentage of those birth are the result of surgical interventions. This course will explore the medicalization of birth, as well as the movements dedicated to promoting home birth, natural birth, and midwifery. Many of the readings will examine birth from an unapologetically feminist and/or holistic perspective, and we will discuss the psychological, political, cultural and spiritual dimensions of birth practices. We will also consider the impact of increasingly sophisticated medical technology on conception and pregnancy, including in vitro fertilization, surrogate mothers, and extending the childbearing years well into late life. An important theme throughout will be the concept of \"appropriate technology\" -- which technologies are appropriate and who decides? Readings will be drawn from a number of sources, principally midwifery, nursing, and medical journals. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "BIRTH CULTURE & MED TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23252/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "BIRTH CULTURE & MED TECH", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "HSOC-334-601", "path": "/courses/23252/sections/601", "id": "23252-601", "aliases": ["HSOC-334-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/23252/sections/601/reviews/1440-ELIZABETH-R--MACKENZIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1440-ELIZABETH-R--MACKENZIE", "first_name": "ELIZABETH R.", "last_name": "MACKENZIE", "id": "1440-ELIZABETH-R--MACKENZIE", "name": "ELIZABETH R.
