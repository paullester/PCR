{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1363"}, "description": "This course introduces students to anthropological and sociological perspectives on the intersection of gender and health. In the course we will examine several theoretical approaches to women and health, such as feminist and political economic perspectives. We will explore key women's health issues such as experiences with the medical establishment, health disparities along lines of race and class, reprodutive health, reproductive rights, body image and women's experiences with HIV/AIDS. These issues will be explored in the context of the United States and developing countries. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "WOMEN AND HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6711/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "3.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "3.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.48", "rCommAbility": "3.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.84"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN AND HEALTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-261-401", "path": "/courses/6711/sections/401", "id": "6711-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-261-401", "WSTD-325-401", "HSOC-216-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/6711/sections/401/reviews/660-ELLEN-ELIZABETH-FOLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/660-ELLEN-ELIZABETH-FOLEY", "first_name": "ELLEN ELIZABETH", "last_name": "FOLEY", "id": "660-ELLEN-ELIZABETH-FOLEY", "name": "ELLEN ELIZABETH FOLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "6711-401-660-ELLEN-ELIZABETH-FOLEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSSC-261", "path": "/courses/6711", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6711/sections", "values": [{"name": "WOMEN AND HEALTH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSSC-261-401", "path": "/courses/6711/sections/401", "id": "6711-401", "aliases": ["HSSC-261-401", "WSTD-325-401", "HSOC-216-401"]}]}, "id": 6711, "aliases": ["HSSC-261", "WSTD-325", "HSOC-216"]}
