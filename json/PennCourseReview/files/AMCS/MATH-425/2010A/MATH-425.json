Prerequisite: MATH 241 or permission of instructor. Knowledge of PHYS 150-151 is helpful.\r\n\r\nMany students stated that they enjoyed this course. One student commented that \u201c[this was] the best math course I\u2019ve taken.\u201d Other students thought it was \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cexcellent, and \u201cgreat.\u201d One student commented that this course taught some \u201cnice analysis tricks,\u201d while another student stated that this course improved overall confidence as a mathematician for future studies. However, one student wrote that the \u201cbook is complex, and not very helpful.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents lauded Professor DeTurck\u2019s teaching abilities. Students agreed \u201cDr. DeTurck's ability to make math logical and understandable is unparalleled,\u201d leading one student to comment that Professor DeTurck was \u201cunbelievably engaging\u201d and makes mathematical concepts \u201cclearer than any other instructor.\u201d Another student explained that Professor DeTurck \u201cis a fantastic lecturer, and he is optimistic and supportive of his students across the board,\u201d which made the course easier and more enjoyable. \r\n\r\nOne student complained that the course was difficult for non-math majors because of the required competency in math. Another student wrote that this class is recommended for all science and engineering majors. One student explained that the midterms are roughly half theoretical and half computational and that they are \u201cdifficult, but fair.\u201d One student mentioned that it is important to attend office hours if students wish to do well.", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/26342/sections/001/reviews/1555-DENNIS-M--DETURCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1555-DENNIS-M--DETURCK", "first_name": "DENNIS M.", "last_name": "DETURCK", "id": "1555-DENNIS-M--DETURCK", "name": "DENNIS M.
