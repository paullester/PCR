{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1919"}, "description": "A survey based soley on primary sources of the main currents of seventeenth-century European thought: the criticism of inherited systems and of the authority of the past; skepticism, rationalism; empiricism; and the rise of the new natural philosophy. We will study deep conceptual change as an historical phenomenon, examining works that were both profoundly influential in the seventeehtn-century and that are of enduring historical significance. There are no prerequisites, and one of the goals of the course is to make seventeenth-century thought accessible in its context to the twenty-first century student. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3109/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-415", "path": "/courses/3109", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3109/sections", "values": [{"name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-415-001", "path": "/courses/3109/sections/001", "id": "3109-001", "aliases": ["HIST-415-001"]}]}, "id": 3109, "aliases": ["HIST-415"]}
