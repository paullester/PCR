{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1919"}, "description": "A survey based soley on primary sources of the main currents of seventeenth-century European thought: the criticism of inherited systems and of the authority of the past; skepticism, rationalism; empiricism; and the rise of the new natural philosophy. We will study deep conceptual change as an historical phenomenon, examining works that were both profoundly influential in the seventeehtn-century and that are of enduring historical significance. There are no prerequisites, and one of the goals of the course is to make seventeenth-century thought accessible in its context to the twenty-first century student. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29103/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.36", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.68", "rWorkRequired": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.94", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-415-401", "path": "/courses/29103/sections/401", "id": "29103-401", "aliases": ["HIST-415-401", "COML-419-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/29103/sections/401/reviews/645-ALAN-C--KORS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/645-ALAN-C--KORS", "first_name": "ALAN C.", "last_name": "KORS", "id": "645-ALAN-C--KORS", "name": "ALAN C.
