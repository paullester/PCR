{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1919"}, "description": "A survey based soley on primary sources of the main currents of seventeenth-century European thought: the criticism of inherited systems and of the authority of the past; skepticism, rationalism; empiricism; and the rise of the new natural philosophy. We will study deep conceptual change as an historical phenomenon, examining works that were both profoundly influential in the seventeehtn-century and that are of enduring historical significance. There are no prerequisites, and one of the goals of the course is to make seventeenth-century thought accessible in its context to the twenty-first century student. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17526/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.63", "rDifficulty": "3.31", "rStimulateInterest": "3.81", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.69", "rWorkRequired": "3.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.81", "rReadingsValue": "3.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.13", "rCommAbility": "3.93", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-415-001", "path": "/courses/17526/sections/001", "id": "17526-001", "aliases": ["HIST-415-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/17526/sections/001/reviews/645-ALAN-C--KORS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/645-ALAN-C--KORS", "first_name": "ALAN C.", "last_name": "KORS", "id": "645-ALAN-C--KORS", "name": "ALAN C.
