{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1919"}, "description": "A survey based soley on primary sources of the main currents of seventeenth-century European thought: the criticism of inherited systems and of the authority of the past; skepticism, rationalism; empiricism; and the rise of the new natural philosophy. We will study deep conceptual change as an historical phenomenon, examining works that were both profoundly influential in the seventeehtn-century and that are of enduring historical significance. There are no prerequisites, and one of the goals of the course is to make seventeenth-century thought accessible in its context to the twenty-first century student. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13415/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.76", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.94"}, "section": {"name": "17 C INTELL HIST", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-415-001", "path": "/courses/13415/sections/001", "id": "13415-001", "aliases": ["HIST-415-001"]}, "comments": "The reviews for this class were incredibly positive.
