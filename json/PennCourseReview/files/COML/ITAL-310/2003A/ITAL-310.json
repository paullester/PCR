{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1373"}, "description": "Through a range of authors including Augustine, Dante, Petrarch, Galileo, and Umberto Eco, this course will explore the world of the book in the manuscript era. We will consider 1) readers in fiction-male and female, good and bad; 2) books as material objects produced in monasteries and their subsequent role in the rise of the universities; 3) medieval women readers and writers; 4) medieval ideas of the book as a symbol (e.g., the notion of the world as God's book); 5) changes in book culture brought about by printing and electronicmedia. Lectures with discussion in English, to be supplemented by visual presentations and a visit to the Rare Book Room in Van Pelt Library. No prerequisites. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "THE MEDIEVAL READER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1822/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.70", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "THE MEDIEVAL READER", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-310-401", "path": "/courses/1822/sections/401", "id": "1822-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-310-401", "WSTD-310-401", "COML-310-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/1822/sections/401/reviews/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "first_name": "VICTORIA E", "last_name": "KIRKHAM", "id": "680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "name": "VICTORIA E KIRKHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "1822-401-680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-310", "path": "/courses/1822", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1822/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE MEDIEVAL READER", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-310-401", "path": "/courses/1822/sections/401", "id": "1822-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-310-401", "WSTD-310-401", "COML-310-401"]}]}, "id": 1822, "aliases": ["ITAL-310", "WSTD-310", "COML-310"]}
