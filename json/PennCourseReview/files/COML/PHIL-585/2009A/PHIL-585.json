{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4384"}, "description": "This course will investigate historical and contemporary philosophical views on the role of the emotions in the arts. Do we have genuine emotional responses to works of art - to fiction? paintings? music? If so, what are the conditions under which we do and don't have such emotional responses? When are such responses appropriate? In particular, does an appropriate aesthetic attitude require emotional distance from the object of the artwork? Is it inappropriate to respond emotionally to morally depraved artworks? How do formal devices induce, constrain, and otherwise alter our emotional responses to art? Readings will be drawn from philosophers including Jean-Baptise Du Bos, David Hume, Edmund Burke, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Home Lord Kames, Arthur Schopenhauer, Edward Bullough, R.G. Collingwood, Stanley Cavell, Tamar Szabo Gendler, Richard Moran, Kendall Walton, and others. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "AESTHE:EMOTION IN ARTS: Aesthetics: Emotion in the Arts", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16313/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.90", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "3.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "AESTHE:EMOTION IN ARTS: Aesthetics: Emotion in the Arts", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-585-401", "path": "/courses/16313/sections/401", "id": "16313-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-585-401", "COML-598-401"]}, "comments": "This course investigates historical and contemporary philosophical views on the role of the emotions in the arts.
