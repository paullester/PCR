{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3626"}, "description": "Since the sixteenth century English has been, among other things, an imperial language, and ideas about empire and imperialism have shaped not only many of English literature's central texts but also the development of English literary study as a discipline. This course is an introduction to the way imperial contact and changing ideas about empire and decolonization have shaped literature in English from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. We will consider historical and cultural materials to offer contexts for literary production of texts from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. The course also will serve as a comprehensive introduction to the way literary and cultural representations of Europe have been influenced by changing ideas about empire and imperialism. Different versions of the course will vary in the historical and cultural material they cover as they offer a context for literary production. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "LITERATURE AND EMPIRE: Imperial contestations in English literature", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11704/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.10", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "LITERATURE AND EMPIRE: Imperial contestations in English literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-077-401", "path": "/courses/11704/sections/401", "id": "11704-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-077-401", "SAST-077-401", "COML-077-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/11704/sections/401/reviews/1833-ANIA-LOOMBA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1833-ANIA-LOOMBA", "first_name": "ANIA", "last_name": "LOOMBA", "id": "1833-ANIA-LOOMBA", "name": "ANIA LOOMBA"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "11704-401-1833-ANIA-LOOMBA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-077", "path": "/courses/11704", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11704/sections", "values": [{"name": "LITERATURE AND EMPIRE: Imperial contestations in English literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-077-401", "path": "/courses/11704/sections/401", "id": "11704-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-077-401", "SAST-077-401", "COML-077-401"]}]}, "id": 11704, "aliases": ["ENGL-077", "SAST-077", "COML-077"]}
