From the press to cabaret, film, and hip-hop, different media have provided women and minorities with means for self-expression in modern Germany. Women as well as ethnic, religious, and sexual minority groups have utilized literature and media to differentiate themselves from the \"majority\" population and generate responses to discrimination or persecution. This course will explore literature, music, film, and advertisements in 20th-century Germany, from Yiddish cabaret songs and dramatic performances by Jews under Nazi supervision, to Turkish-German film, Afro-German poetry, contemporary klezmer and hip-hop, and LGBT poster campaigns. This course will offer students the opportunity to improve their public speaking skills as they analyze storytelling, performance, and staging techniques in a variety of speaking assignments including multi-media presentations. Classroom discussions and debates about topics such as censorship, memorials, and women's and gay rights will provide additional speaking practice. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "THE IMAGE OF BERLIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18763/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "THE IMAGE OF BERLIN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-238-401", "path": "/courses/18763/sections/401", "id": "18763-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-238-401", "COML-244-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/18763/sections/401/reviews/2162-CURTIS-SWOPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2162-CURTIS-SWOPE", "first_name": "CURTIS", "last_name": "SWOPE", "id": "2162-CURTIS-SWOPE", "name": "CURTIS SWOPE"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "18763-401-2162-CURTIS-SWOPE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-238", "path": "/courses/18763", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18763/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE IMAGE OF BERLIN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-238-401", "path": "/courses/18763/sections/401", "id": "18763-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-238-401", "COML-244-401"]}]}, "id": 18763, "aliases": ["GRMN-238", "COML-244"]}
