{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3933"}, "description": "This course is about Russian literature, which is populated with saints and devils, believers and religious rebels, holy men and sinners. In Russia, where peoples frame of mind had been formed by a mix of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and earlier folk beliefs, the quest for faith, spirituality and the meaning of life has invariably been connected with religious matters. How can one find the right path in life? Is humility the way to salvation? Should one live for God or for the people? Does God even exist? \n\nIn Saints and Devils, we will examine Russian literature concerning the holy and the demonic as representations of good and evil, and we will learn about the historic trends that have filled Russias national character with religious and supernatural spirit. In the course of this semester we will talk about ancient cultural traditions, remarkable works of art and the great artists who created them. All readings and films are in English. Our primary focus will be on works by Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Tolstoy, and Bulgakov. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "SAINTS & DEVILS RUSS LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25080/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "SAINTS & DEVILS RUSS LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-213-401", "path": "/courses/25080/sections/401", "id": "25080-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-213-401", "COML-213-401", "RELS-218-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/25080/sections/401/reviews/2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV", "first_name": "JULIA", "last_name": "VERKHOLANTSEV", "id": "2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV", "name": "JULIA VERKHOLANTSEV"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "25080-401-2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-213", "path": "/courses/25080", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25080/sections", "values": [{"name": "SAINTS & DEVILS RUSS LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-213-401", "path": "/courses/25080/sections/401", "id": "25080-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-213-401", "COML-213-401", "RELS-218-401"]}]}, "id": 25080, "aliases": ["RUSS-213", "COML-213", "RELS-218"]}
