{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3095"}, "description": "This course will explore fantasy and the fantastic in short tales of 19th- and 20th-century French literature. A variety of approaches -- thematic, psychoanalytic, cultural, narratological -- will be used in an attempt to test their viability and define the subversive force of a literary mode that contributes to shedding light on the dark side of the human psyche by interrogating the \"real,\" making visible the unseen and articulating the unsaid. Such broad categories as distortions of space and time, reason and madness, order and disorder, sexual transgressions, self and other will be considered. Readings will include \"recits fantastiques\" by Merimee, Gautier, Nerval, Maupassant, Breton, Pieyre de Mandiargues, Jean Ray and others. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "FANTASTIC LIT-19/20TH C", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7782/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "3.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "FANTASTIC LIT-19/20TH C", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FREN-582-401", "path": "/courses/7782/sections/401", "id": "7782-401", "aliases": ["FREN-582-401", "COML-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/7782/sections/401/reviews/1459-PHILIPPE-C--MET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1459-PHILIPPE-C--MET", "first_name": "PHILIPPE C.", "last_name": "MET", "id": "1459-PHILIPPE-C--MET", "name": "PHILIPPE C.
