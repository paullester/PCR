{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4296"}, "description": "How has our image of Italy arrived to us? Where does the story begin and who has recounted, rewritten, and rearranged it over the centuries? In this course, we will study Italy's rich and complex past and present. We will carefully read literary and historical texts and thoughtfully watch films in order to attain an understanding of Italy that is as varied and multifacted as the country itself. Group work, discussions and readings will allow us to examine the problems and trends in the political, cultural and social history from ancient Rome to today. We will focus on: the Roman Empire, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Unification, Turn of the Century, Fascist era, World War II, post-war and contemporary Italy. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "ITALIAN HIST ON SCREEN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20390/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.58", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.08", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "1.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.58", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "ITALIAN HIST ON SCREEN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-204-401", "path": "/courses/20390/sections/401", "id": "20390-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-204-401", "CINE-240-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/20390/sections/401/reviews/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "first_name": "VICTORIA E", "last_name": "KIRKHAM", "id": "680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "name": "VICTORIA E KIRKHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "20390-401-680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-204", "path": "/courses/20390", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20390/sections", "values": [{"name": "ITALIAN HIST ON SCREEN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-204-401", "path": "/courses/20390/sections/401", "id": "20390-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-204-401", "CINE-240-401"]}]}, "id": 20390, "aliases": ["ITAL-204", "CINE-240"]}
