{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3066"}, "description": "This course introduces students to major issues in the history of literary theory, and provides an excellent foundation for the English major or minor. Treating the work of Plato and Aristotle as well as contemporary criticism, we will consider the fundamental issues that arise from representation, making meaning, appropriation and adaptation, categorization and genre, historicity and genealogy, and historicity and temporality. We will consider major movements in the history of theory including the \"New\" Criticism of the 1920's and 30's, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and psychoanalysis, feminism, cultural studies, critical race theory, and queer theory. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "INTRO LITERARY THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27298/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO LITERARY THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-094-401", "path": "/courses/27298/sections/401", "id": "27298-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-094-401", "COML-094-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/27298/sections/401/reviews/3957-DAVID-L--ENG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3957-DAVID-L--ENG", "first_name": "DAVID L.", "last_name": "ENG", "id": "3957-DAVID-L--ENG", "name": "DAVID L.
