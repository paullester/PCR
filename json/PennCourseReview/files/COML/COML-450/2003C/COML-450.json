{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2252"}, "description": "\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" This course will consider Tolstoy's observation through the study of a series of continental novels from France, Germany, Russia, and Italy. As the genre of the novel began to take shape and become differentiated from that of the romance, the former's seeming \"relation\" to real life--\"a recognizable secular social world\"--took hold as one of its defining characteristics. Among the ways in which the novel appeared to depict \"real life\" was its exploration of individuals' private desires in conflict with their perceived familial and marital responsibilities. The narrative techniques as well as plots of such texts will be analyzed in our exploration of the development of the Western novel outside of Britain. Texts will include Madame de La Fayette's LA PRINCESSE DE CLEVES, Goethe's THE CONFESSIONS OF ZENO, among others. All readings will be in translation. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "EUROPEAN NOVEL 1678-1923", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3926/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "EUROPEAN NOVEL 1678-1923", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "COML-450-640", "path": "/courses/3926/sections/640", "id": "3926-640", "aliases": ["COML-450-640", "ENGL-475-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/3926/sections/640/reviews/412-NANCY-M-SHAWCROSS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/412-NANCY-M-SHAWCROSS", "first_name": "NANCY M", "last_name": "SHAWCROSS", "id": "412-NANCY-M-SHAWCROSS", "name": "NANCY M SHAWCROSS"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "3926-640-412-NANCY-M-SHAWCROSS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-450", "path": "/courses/3926", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3926/sections", "values": [{"name": "EUROPEAN NOVEL 1678-1923", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "COML-450-640", "path": "/courses/3926/sections/640", "id": "3926-640", "aliases": ["COML-450-640", "ENGL-475-640"]}]}, "id": 3926, "aliases": ["COML-450", "ENGL-475"]}
