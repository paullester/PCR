{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3238"}, "description": "This course offers an overview of the cultural history of Rus from its origins to the eighteenth century, a period which laid the foundation for the Russian Empire. The course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the evolution of the main cultural paradigms of Russian Orthodoxy viewed in a broader European context. Although this course is historical in content, it is also about modern Russia. The legacy of Medieval Rus is still referenced, often allegorically, in contemporary social and cultural discourse as the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian societies attempt to reconstruct and reinterpret their histories. In this course, students learn that the study of the medieval cultural and political history explains many aspects of modern Russian society, its culture and mentality. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Medieval Russia: Origins of Russian Cultural Identity", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25081/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.86", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "Medieval Russia: Origins of Russian Cultural Identity", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-234-401", "path": "/courses/25081/sections/401", "id": "25081-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-234-401", "HIST-219-401", "SLAV-517-401", "COML-235-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/25081/sections/401/reviews/2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV", "first_name": "JULIA", "last_name": "VERKHOLANTSEV", "id": "2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV", "name": "JULIA VERKHOLANTSEV"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "25081-401-2326-JULIA-VERKHOLANTSEV"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-234", "path": "/courses/25081", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25081/sections", "values": [{"name": "Medieval Russia: Origins of Russian Cultural Identity", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-234-401", "path": "/courses/25081/sections/401", "id": "25081-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-234-401", "HIST-219-401", "SLAV-517-401", "COML-235-401"]}]}, "id": 25081, "aliases": ["RUSS-234", "HIST-219", "SLAV-517", "COML-235"]}
