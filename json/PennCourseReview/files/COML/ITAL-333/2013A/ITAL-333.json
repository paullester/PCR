{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1374"}, "description": "In this course we will read the Inferno, the Purgatorio and the Paradiso, focusing on a series of interrelated problems raised by the poem: authority, fiction, history, politics and language. Particular attention will be given to how the Commedia presents itself as Dante's autobiography, and to how the autobiographical narrative serves as a unifying thread for this supremely rich literary text. Supplementary readings will include Virgil's Aeneid and selections from Ovid's Metamorphoses. All readings and written work will be in English. Italian or Italian Studies credit will require reading Italian text the original language and writing about their themes in Italian. This course may be taken for graduate credit, but additional work and meetings with the instructor will be required. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30507/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58"}, "section": {"name": "DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-333-401", "path": "/courses/30507/sections/401", "id": "30507-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-333-401", "COML-333-401", "ENGL-323-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/30507/sections/401/reviews/268-KEVIN-BROWNLEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/268-KEVIN-BROWNLEE", "first_name": "KEVIN", "last_name": "BROWNLEE", "id": "268-KEVIN-BROWNLEE", "name": "KEVIN BROWNLEE"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "30507-401-268-KEVIN-BROWNLEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-333", "path": "/courses/30507", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30507/sections", "values": [{"name": "DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-333-401", "path": "/courses/30507/sections/401", "id": "30507-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-333-401", "COML-333-401", "ENGL-323-401"]}]}, "id": 30507, "aliases": ["ITAL-333", "COML-333", "ENGL-323"]}
