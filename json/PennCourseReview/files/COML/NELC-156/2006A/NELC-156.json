{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3179"}, "description": "The study of four paradigmatic and classic Jewish texts so as to introduce students to the literature of classic Judaism. Each text will be studied historically -- \"excavated\" for its sources and roots -- and holistically, as a canonical document in Jewish tradition. While each text will inevitably raise its own set of issues, we will deal throughout the semester with two basic questions: What makes a \"Jewish\" text? And how do these texts represent different aspects of Jewish identity? All readings will be in translation. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "GREAT BOOKS OF JUDAISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8090/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "GREAT BOOKS OF JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-156-401", "path": "/courses/8090/sections/401", "id": "8090-401", "aliases": ["NELC-156-401", "COML-057-401", "JWST-151-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/8090/sections/401/reviews/29-MICHAEL-A--CARASIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/29-MICHAEL-A--CARASIK", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARASIK", "id": "29-MICHAEL-A--CARASIK", "name": "MICHAEL A.
