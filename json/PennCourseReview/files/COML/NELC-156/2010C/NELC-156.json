{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3179"}, "description": "The study of four paradigmatic and classic Jewish texts so as to introduce students to the literature of classic Judaism. Each text will be studied historically -- \"excavated\" for its sources and roots -- and holistically, as a canonical document in Jewish tradition. While each text will inevitably raise its own set of issues, we will deal throughout the semester with two basic questions: What makes a \"Jewish\" text? And how do these texts represent different aspects of Jewish identity? All readings will be in translation. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "GREAT BOOKS OF JUDAISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23504/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.80", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "GREAT BOOKS OF JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-156-401", "path": "/courses/23504/sections/401", "id": "23504-401", "aliases": ["NELC-156-401", "JWST-151-401", "RELS-027-401", "COML-057-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/23504/sections/401/reviews/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "first_name": "DAVID M.", "last_name": "STERN", "id": "61-DAVID-M--STERN", "name": "DAVID M.
