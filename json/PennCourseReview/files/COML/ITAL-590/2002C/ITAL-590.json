{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1951"}, "description": "We will be studying a series of books and their cinematic adaptations, considering first the texts in autonomous, literary terms, and then their transformation into audio-visual spectacles. Time will be spent on theories of adaptation--a study which will embrace a wide range of critical methodologies, including semiotics, structuralism, feminism, psychoanalysis, postmodernism, and ideological criticism. In most cases we will devote a week to developing a literary reading of the work, and then a week to comparative study of text and film, after the out-of-class screening, making extensive use of video clips to do close visual analysis of scenes in the light of their corresponding textual sources. The course will be conducted as a seminar. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "LITERATURE INTO FILM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3155/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "LITERATURE INTO FILM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-590-401", "path": "/courses/3155/sections/401", "id": "3155-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-590-401", "COML-596-401", "FILM-545-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/3155/sections/401/reviews/695-MILLICENT-J-MARCUS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/695-MILLICENT-J-MARCUS", "first_name": "MILLICENT J", "last_name": "MARCUS", "id": "695-MILLICENT-J-MARCUS", "name": "MILLICENT J MARCUS"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "3155-401-695-MILLICENT-J-MARCUS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-590", "path": "/courses/3155", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3155/sections", "values": [{"name": "LITERATURE INTO FILM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ITAL-590-401", "path": "/courses/3155/sections/401", "id": "3155-401", "aliases": ["ITAL-590-401", "COML-596-401", "FILM-545-401"]}]}, "id": 3155, "aliases": ["ITAL-590", "COML-596", "FILM-545"]}
