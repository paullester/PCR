{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5421"}, "description": "More than only a child's plaything, the doll has been the object of avantgarde experimentation in literature, art, and film, and of much theoretical discussion, especially in the fileds of psychoanalysis and anthropology. A source of childhood nostalgia, imaginative engagement, and delight, the doll has, however also been the starting point for countless horror movies, in its incarnation as a deviant monster. A magical, talismanic object that animates the world, it hints at the potency of the material world's hold over us as human beings. What desires and anxieties are aroused by dolls? Do dolls have souls? What happens when dolls appear to acquire lives of their own? How have dolls been used as vehicles for social critique, in particular as they relate to representations of commodities, fashion, or the female body? Readings will include: Goethe, Kleist, Hoffmann, Baudelaire, Rilke, Freud. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "THE DOLL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27513/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "THE DOLL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-273-401", "path": "/courses/27513/sections/401", "id": "27513-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-273-401", "COML-276-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/27513/sections/401/reviews/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "first_name": "CATRIONA", "last_name": "MACLEOD", "id": "1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD", "name": "CATRIONA MACLEOD"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "27513-401-1480-CATRIONA-MACLEOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-273", "path": "/courses/27513", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27513/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE DOLL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-273-401", "path": "/courses/27513/sections/401", "id": "27513-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-273-401", "COML-276-401"]}]}, "id": 27513, "aliases": ["GRMN-273", "COML-276"]}
