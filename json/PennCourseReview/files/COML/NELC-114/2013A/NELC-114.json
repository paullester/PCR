{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5699"}, "description": "This course, which requires no knowledge of Persian, aims to introduce students to the major trends and developments in the Persian literary tradition, which has spanned for more than a millennium. Introductory sessions will familiarize students with the history of Persian literature, especially the transition away from classical modes of representation, a tradition that was largely poetic, to modern genres and forms, including the novel, blank-verse poetry, and short stories. However, most of the course will be organized thematically rather than chronologically, and each unit will bring together literary texts from both the classical and modern traditions. Together we will examine how authors from different historical periods have utilized a limited number of motifs in order to represent and critique the dominant religious and social institutions of their time. We will conclude by considering the rapid politicalization of Persian literature in the 20th century and recent efforts to control systems of representation, and especially the written word, in the Islamic Republic of Iran. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO PERSIAN LITERATURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30716/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO PERSIAN LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-114-401", "path": "/courses/30716/sections/401", "id": "30716-401", "aliases": ["NELC-114-401", "COML-122-401", "NELC-614-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/30716/sections/401/reviews/5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD", "first_name": "BLAKE", "last_name": "ATWOOD", "id": "5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD", "name": "BLAKE ATWOOD"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30716-401-5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-114", "path": "/courses/30716", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30716/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO PERSIAN LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-114-401", "path": "/courses/30716/sections/401", "id": "30716-401", "aliases": ["NELC-114-401", "COML-122-401", "NELC-614-401"]}]}, "id": 30716, "aliases": ["NELC-114", "COML-122", "NELC-614"]}
