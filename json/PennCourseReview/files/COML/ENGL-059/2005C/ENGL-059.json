{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2528"}, "description": "This class explores the international emergence of modernism, typically from the middle of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century. We will examine the links between modernity, the avant-garde, and various national modernisms that emerged alongside them. Resolutely transatlantic and open to French, Spanish, Italian, German, or Russian influences, this course assumes the very concept of Modernism to necessitate an international perspective focusing on the new in literature and the arts -- including film, the theatre, music, and the visual arts. The philosophies of modernism will also be surveyed and concise introductions provided to important thinkers like Marx, Nietzsche, Sorel, Bergson, Freud, and Benjamin. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "MODERNISMS & MODERNITIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11696/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "2.61", "rRecommendMajor": "2.65", "rCourseQuality": "2.26", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.96", "rCommAbility": "2.61", "rInstructorQuality": "2.65"}, "section": {"name": "MODERNISMS & MODERNITIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-059-401", "path": "/courses/11696/sections/401", "id": "11696-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-059-401", "COML-059-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/11696/sections/401/reviews/2102-CYNTHIA-PORT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2102-CYNTHIA-PORT", "first_name": "CYNTHIA", "last_name": "PORT", "id": "2102-CYNTHIA-PORT", "name": "CYNTHIA PORT"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "11696-401-2102-CYNTHIA-PORT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-059", "path": "/courses/11696", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11696/sections", "values": [{"name": "MODERNISMS & MODERNITIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-059-401", "path": "/courses/11696/sections/401", "id": "11696-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-059-401", "COML-059-401"]}]}, "id": 11696, "aliases": ["ENGL-059", "COML-059"]}
