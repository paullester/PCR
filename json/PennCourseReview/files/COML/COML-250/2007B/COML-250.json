{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1549"}, "description": "What makes detective fiction perhaps the most popular fictional genre at the close of the twentieth century? How can we explain the adaptability of detective fiction for exploring social issues, such as race, class, and gender? The course will begin with an interrogation of genre, exploring the fluid criteria which make a text a \"detective story.\" This basis will permit an analysis of the transformations which have occurred in the genre throughout the centuries. Explicitly literary issues such as narrativity, textuality, and signification will be explored, as well as the \"existential\" detective novel (the detective story as a search for identity) and congruences with psychonalysis. Among the authors will be Sophocles, Poe, Conan Doyle, Chandler, Christie, P.D. James, Paretsky, Thomas Harris, Borges, and Auster. Films may include Clouzot's Diabolique and The Crow, The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, and Seven. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "WHODUNIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12587/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "WHODUNIT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "COML-250-910", "path": "/courses/12587/sections/910", "id": "12587-910", "aliases": ["COML-250-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/12587/sections/910/reviews/2899-CEDRIC-TOLLIVER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2899-CEDRIC-TOLLIVER", "first_name": "CEDRIC", "last_name": "TOLLIVER", "id": "2899-CEDRIC-TOLLIVER", "name": "CEDRIC TOLLIVER"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "12587-910-2899-CEDRIC-TOLLIVER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-250", "path": "/courses/12587", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12587/sections", "values": [{"name": "WHODUNIT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "COML-250-910", "path": "/courses/12587/sections/910", "id": "12587-910", "aliases": ["COML-250-910"]}]}, "id": 12587, "aliases": ["COML-250"]}
