{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5197"}, "description": "Representations of war are created for as many reasons as wars are fought: to legitimate armed conflict, to critique brutality, to vilify an enemy, to mobilize popular support, to generate national pride, etc. In this course we will examine a series of representations of war drawn from the literature, film, state propaganda, memoirs, visual art, etc. of Russia, Europe and the United States. We will pursue an investigation of these images of conflict and bloodshed in the larger context of the history of military technology, social life, and communications media over the last two centuries. Students will be expected to write two papers, take part in a group presentation on an assigned topic, and take a final exa. The goal of the course will be to gain knowledge of literary history in social and historical context, and to acquire critical skills for analysis of rhetoric and visual representations. \n\n", "semester": "2011B", "name": "War and its Representations in Europe, Russia and the US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25297/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "War and its Representations in Europe, Russia and the US", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "COML-150-920", "path": "/courses/25297/sections/920", "id": "25297-920", "aliases": ["COML-150-920", "RUSS-193-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/25297/sections/920/reviews/4599-SHOSHANA-T-ENELOW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4599-SHOSHANA-T-ENELOW", "first_name": "SHOSHANA T", "last_name": "ENELOW", "id": "4599-SHOSHANA-T-ENELOW", "name": "SHOSHANA T ENELOW"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "25297-920-4599-SHOSHANA-T-ENELOW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-150", "path": "/courses/25297", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25297/sections", "values": [{"name": "War and its Representations in Europe, Russia and the US", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "COML-150-920", "path": "/courses/25297/sections/920", "id": "25297-920", "aliases": ["COML-150-920", "RUSS-193-920"]}]}, "id": 25297, "aliases": ["COML-150", "RUSS-193"]}
