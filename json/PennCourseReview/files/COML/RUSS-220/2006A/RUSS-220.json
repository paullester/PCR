{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2406"}, "description": "This course will explore the representations of the West in eighteenth- and nineteenth- century Russian literature and philosophy. We will consider the Russian visions of various events and aspects of Western political and social life Revolutions, educational system, public executions, resorts, etc. within the context of Russian intellectual history. We will examine how images of the West reflect Russia's own cultural concerns, anticipations, and biases, as well as aesthetic preoccupations and interests of Russian writers. \n\nThe discussion will include literary works by Karamzin, Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Leskov, and Tolstoy, as well as non-fictional documents, such as travelers' letters, diaries, and historiosophical treatises of Russian Freemasons, Romantic and Positivist thinkers, and Russian social philosophers of the late Nineteenth century. A basic knowledge of nineteenth-century European history is desirable. The class will consist of lectures, discussion, short writing assignments, and two in-class tests. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "RUSSIA AND THE WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8336/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.81", "rReadingsValue": "3.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "RUSSIA AND THE WEST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-220-401", "path": "/courses/8336/sections/401", "id": "8336-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-220-401", "COML-220-401", "HIST-220-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/8336/sections/401/reviews/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "first_name": "ILYA", "last_name": "VINITSKY", "id": "2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "name": "ILYA VINITSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "8336-401-2325-ILYA-VINITSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-220", "path": "/courses/8336", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8336/sections", "values": [{"name": "RUSSIA AND THE WEST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-220-401", "path": "/courses/8336/sections/401", "id": "8336-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-220-401", "COML-220-401", "HIST-220-401"]}]}, "id": 8336, "aliases": ["RUSS-220", "COML-220", "HIST-220"]}
