We will consider the Russian visions of various events and aspects of Western political and social life Revolutions, educational system, public executions, resorts, etc. within the context of Russian intellectual history. We will examine how images of the West reflect Russia's own cultural concerns, anticipations, and biases, as well as aesthetic preoccupations and interests of Russian writers. \n\nThe discussion will include literary works by Karamzin, Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Leskov, and Tolstoy, as well as non-fictional documents, such as travelers' letters, diaries, and historiosophical treatises of Russian Freemasons, Romantic and Positivist thinkers, and Russian social philosophers of the late Nineteenth century. A basic knowledge of nineteenth-century European history is desirable. The class will consist of lectures, discussion, short writing assignments, and two in-class tests. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "RUSSIA AND THE WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23750/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.84", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.34", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.34", "rInstructorQuality": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "RUSSIA AND THE WEST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-220-401", "path": "/courses/23750/sections/401", "id": "23750-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-220-401", "HIST-220-401", "COML-220-401"]}, "comments": "This course will explore the representations of the West in eighteenth- and nineteenth- century Russian literature and philosophy.

However, one student did comment that the course did not seem to be as in depth as they had expected.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Walker as an excellent lecturer, interesting, and funny. One student commented that Professor Walker \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d Another student also said that they found Professor Walker\u2019s \u201clecture style is very hard to listen to,\u201d while another student commented that he would often get off topic. In contrast, however, one student commented that it was a \u201cvery well structured class.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral students said that the course did not require a large amount of work, and one mentioned that, \u201cthe course definitely wasn't as difficult as it could've been.\u201d One student said that the \u201creadings were all very interesting and never excessive.\u201d Another student commented that, \u201cthe grading scheme was troubling since there was a hidden 20% participation grade,\u201d and that the \u201ctests unfairly required you to identify specific and often trivial quotes from these extensive readings.\u201d Another student mentioned, though, that some \u201chistorical and contextual background\u201d would have been beneficial.
