{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3065"}, "description": "From abstraction to beat, from socialism to negritude, from expressionism to ecopoetry, from surrealism to visual poetry, from collage to digital poetry, the poetry of the twentieth century has been characterized by both the varieties of its forms and the range of its practitioners. This course will offer a broad overview of many of the major trends and a few minor eddies in the immensely rich, wonderfully varied, ideologically and aesthetically charged field. The course will cover many of the radical poetry movements and individual innovations, along with the more conventional and idiosyncratic work, and will provide examples of political, social, ethnic, and national poetries, both in the Americas and Europe, and beyond to the rest of the world. While most of the poetry covered will be in English, works in translation, and indeed the art of translation, will be an essential component the course. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "20th Century Poetry from Outside of the US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15615/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.26", "rDifficulty": "2.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.39", "rRecommendMajor": "3.74", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "3.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "20th Century Poetry from Outside of the US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-062-401", "path": "/courses/15615/sections/401", "id": "15615-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-062-401", "COML-062-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/15615/sections/401/reviews/2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN", "first_name": "CHARLES", "last_name": "BERNSTEIN", "id": "2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN", "name": "CHARLES BERNSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "15615-401-2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-062", "path": "/courses/15615", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15615/sections", "values": [{"name": "20th Century Poetry from Outside of the US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-062-401", "path": "/courses/15615/sections/401", "id": "15615-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-062-401", "COML-062-401"]}]}, "id": 15615, "aliases": ["ENGL-062", "COML-062"]}
