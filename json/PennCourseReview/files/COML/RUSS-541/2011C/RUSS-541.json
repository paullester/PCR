{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5266"}, "description": "This course will consider the role of western mystical legacy (from Jakob Bohme to Madame Blavatsky) in 19th-Century Russian literature and culture. From the late 18th to early 20th century, Russia witnessed several surges (or awakening s) of mysticism. As a rule, these mystical waves came from the West (usually t hrough German intermediacy) and tended to coincide with critical historical junctures, such as the moral crisis at the end of the reign of Catherine the Great (the rise of Russian Free Masonry), the Russian victory over Napoleon and the establishment of a new European order (the emergence of Russian mystical/political circles of the 1810s), a deep ideological schism in the Russian intelligentsia in the 1860s (the rise of Russian spiritualism), and finally, the revolutionary period in the first decade of the 20th century. \n\nIn this course, we will interpret these \"awakenings\" as a particular kind of cultural historical text which symbolically expresses and performs certain tendencies that are typical for the intellectual and psychological life of a given historical period. Our reading list inlcudes works by Western mystics, such as Bohme, Guyon, Swedenborg, Jung-Stilling, Kardec, and Madame Blavatsky, and Russian writers, including Pushkin, Odoevsky, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Solovyov. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Russian Awakenings: Western Mysticism & Nineteenth-century Russian Culture", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25087/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "Russian Awakenings: Western Mysticism & Nineteenth-century Russian Culture", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-541-301", "path": "/courses/25087/sections/301", "id": "25087-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-541-301", "COML-531-301", "GRMN-541-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/25087/sections/301/reviews/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "first_name": "ILYA", "last_name": "VINITSKY", "id": "2325-ILYA-VINITSKY", "name": "ILYA VINITSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "25087-301-2325-ILYA-VINITSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-541", "path": "/courses/25087", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25087/sections", "values": [{"name": "Russian Awakenings: Western Mysticism & Nineteenth-century Russian Culture", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RUSS-541-301", "path": "/courses/25087/sections/301", "id": "25087-301", "aliases": ["RUSS-541-301", "COML-531-301", "GRMN-541-301"]}]}, "id": 25087, "aliases": ["RUSS-541", "COML-531", "GRMN-541"]}
