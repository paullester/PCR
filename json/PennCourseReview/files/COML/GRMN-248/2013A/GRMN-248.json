{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4574"}, "description": "\"God is dead.\" This famous, all too famous death sentence, issued by the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, also signaled the genesis of a radical challenge to traditional notions of morality, cultural life, and the structure of society as a whole. In this course we will examine both the \"modernity\" of Nietzsche's thought and the ways in which his ideas have helped to define the very concept of Modernity (and, arguably, Postmodernity) itself. In exploring the origin and evolution of Nietzsche's key concepts, we will trace the ways in which his work has been variously revered or refuted, championed or co-opted, for more than a century. We will survey his broad influence on everything from philosophy and literature to music and art, theater and psychology, history and cultural theory, politics and popular culture. Further, we will ask how his ideas continue to challenge us today, though perhaps in unexpected ways. As we will see, Nietzsche wanted to teach us \"how to philosophize with a hammer.\" \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "NIETZSCHE'S MODERNITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30399/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.42", "rTAQuality": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.84", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "NIETZSCHE'S MODERNITY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-248-401", "path": "/courses/30399/sections/401", "id": "30399-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-248-401", "COML-268-401", "PHIL-067-401", "RELS-238-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/30399/sections/401/reviews/3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI", "first_name": "ERIC", "last_name": "JAROSINSKI", "id": "3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI", "name": "ERIC JAROSINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "30399-401-3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-248", "path": "/courses/30399", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30399/sections", "values": [{"name": "NIETZSCHE'S MODERNITY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-248-401", "path": "/courses/30399/sections/401", "id": "30399-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-248-401", "COML-268-401", "PHIL-067-401", "RELS-238-401"]}]}, "id": 30399, "aliases": ["GRMN-248", "COML-268", "PHIL-067", "RELS-238"]}
