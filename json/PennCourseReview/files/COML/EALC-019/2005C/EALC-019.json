{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3726"}, "description": "The vernacular prose works of women writers from the tenth and eleventh centuries have had an important place in the canon of Japan's national literature. Perhaps more surprisingly, English translations of these works have inspired artists outside Japan to produce a variety of imitations and variations. We will read the so-called \"Pillow Book\" of Sei Shonagon, a witty court lady, and English novels inspired by it (My Year of Meats, My Name is Sei Shonagon, White Oleander), as well as consider the Peter Greenaway film. Other texts will include Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji and anthropologist Liza Dalby's Tale of Murasaki, an imitation diary told in the voice of \"the world's first novelist.\" Our questions will range from what makes an author to global and national literary exchanges, theories of originals and copies, and the role of gender in writing. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "AUTHRS&IMITATORS:JPN WOM: Authors & Imitators: Cloning Japanese Women Writers Around the World", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11635/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "AUTHRS&IMITATORS:JPN WOM: Authors & Imitators: Cloning Japanese Women Writers Around the World", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-019-401", "path": "/courses/11635/sections/401", "id": "11635-401", "aliases": ["EALC-019-401", "COML-019-401", "WSTD-019-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/11635/sections/401/reviews/1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "first_name": "LINDA H.", "last_name": "CHANCE", "id": "1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "name": "LINDA H.
