{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2586"}, "description": "Although its pages may appear innocuous enough, bound innocently between non-descript covers, the book has frequently become the locus of intense suspicion, legal legislation, and various cultural struggles. But what causes a book to blow its cover? In this course we will consider a range of specific censorship cases in the west since the invention of the printed book to the present day. We will consider the role of various censorship authorities (both religious and secular) and grapple with the timely question about whether censorship is ever justified in building a better society. Case studies will focus on many well-known figures (such as Martin Luther, John Milton, Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe, Karl Marx, and Salman Rushdie) as well as lesser-known authors, particularly Anonymous (who may have chosen to conceal her identity to avoid pursuit by the Censor). \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "CENSORED!", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5395/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.35", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.45", "rCourseQuality": "3.16", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.15", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "CENSORED!", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-003-301", "path": "/courses/5395/sections/301", "id": "5395-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-003-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/5395/sections/301/reviews/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "first_name": "BETHANY", "last_name": "WIGGIN", "id": "2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN", "name": "BETHANY WIGGIN"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "5395-301-2169-BETHANY-WIGGIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-003", "path": "/courses/5395", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5395/sections", "values": [{"name": "CENSORED!", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GRMN-003-301", "path": "/courses/5395/sections/301", "id": "5395-301", "aliases": ["GRMN-003-301"]}]}, "id": 5395, "aliases": ["GRMN-003"]}
