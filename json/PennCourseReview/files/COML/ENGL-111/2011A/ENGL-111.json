{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2267"}, "description": "It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and digital replication. How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation, replication, plagiaris, piracy, sampling, plundering, as compositional methods. Along the way, we'll trace the rich history of forgery, frauds, hoaxes, avatars, and impersonations spanning the arts, with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change, procedure, repetition, adn the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional notions of time, place, and identity, all as expressed linguistically. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM: The Ecology of Poetry", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21592/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM: The Ecology of Poetry", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-111-301", "path": "/courses/21592/sections/301", "id": "21592-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-111-301", "COML-115-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/21592/sections/301/reviews/5342-MARCELLA-CHLOE-DURAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5342-MARCELLA-CHLOE-DURAND", "first_name": "MARCELLA CHLOE", "last_name": "DURAND", "id": "5342-MARCELLA-CHLOE-DURAND", "name": "MARCELLA CHLOE DURAND"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "21592-301-5342-MARCELLA-CHLOE-DURAND"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.70", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-111-401", "path": "/courses/21592/sections/401", "id": "21592-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-111-401", "COML-115-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/21592/sections/401/reviews/2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN", "first_name": "CHARLES", "last_name": "BERNSTEIN", "id": "2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN", "name": "CHARLES BERNSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "21592-401-2126-CHARLES-BERNSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-111", "path": "/courses/21592", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21592/sections", "values": [{"name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM: The Ecology of Poetry", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-111-301", "path": "/courses/21592/sections/301", "id": "21592-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-111-301", "COML-115-301"]}, {"name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-111-401", "path": "/courses/21592/sections/401", "id": "21592-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-111-401", "COML-115-401"]}]}, "id": 21592, "aliases": ["ENGL-111", "COML-115"]}
