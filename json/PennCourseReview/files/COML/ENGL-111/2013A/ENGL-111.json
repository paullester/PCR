{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2267"}, "description": "It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and digital replication. How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation, replication, plagiaris, piracy, sampling,and plundering, as compositional methods. Along the way, we'll tarce the rich history of forgery, frauds, hoaxes, avatars, and impersonations spanning the arts with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change, procedure, repetition, and the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with populor culture to usurp conventional notions of time, place, and identity, all as expressed linguistically. \n\nSee English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30203/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.29", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-111-301", "path": "/courses/30203/sections/301", "id": "30203-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-111-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/30203/sections/301/reviews/6486-RONALD-G-SILLIMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6486-RONALD-G-SILLIMAN", "first_name": "RONALD G", "last_name": "SILLIMAN", "id": "6486-RONALD-G-SILLIMAN", "name": "RONALD G SILLIMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "30203-301-6486-RONALD-G-SILLIMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-111", "path": "/courses/30203", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30203/sections", "values": [{"name": "EXPERIMENTAL WRITING SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-111-301", "path": "/courses/30203/sections/301", "id": "30203-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-111-301"]}]}, "id": 30203, "aliases": ["ENGL-111"]}
