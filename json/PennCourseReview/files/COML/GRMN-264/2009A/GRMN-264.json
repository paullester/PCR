{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4270"}, "description": "\"Languages are not strangers to one another,\" writes the great critic and translator Walter Benjamin. Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depend upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts. \n\nWith a diverse group of readings--autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthrology, and literary theory--this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture. What does it mean to translate? How do we read a text in translation? What does it mean to live between two languages? Who is a translator? What are different kinds of literary and cultural translation? what are their principles and theories? Their assumptions and practices? Their effects on and implications for the individual and the society? \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "TRANSLATING CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15849/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.90", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.30", "rCommAbility": "2.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "TRANSLATING CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-264-401", "path": "/courses/15849/sections/401", "id": "15849-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-264-401", "COML-260-401", "JWST-264-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/15849/sections/401/reviews/596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN", "first_name": "KATHRYN ANN", "last_name": "HELLERSTEIN", "id": "596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN", "name": "KATHRYN ANN HELLERSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "15849-401-596-KATHRYN-ANN-HELLERSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GRMN-264", "path": "/courses/15849", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15849/sections", "values": [{"name": "TRANSLATING CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GRMN-264-401", "path": "/courses/15849/sections/401", "id": "15849-401", "aliases": ["GRMN-264-401", "COML-260-401", "JWST-264-401"]}]}, "id": 15849, "aliases": ["GRMN-264", "COML-260", "JWST-264"]}
