The course focuses on works widely read in the eighteenth century and of enduring historical significance.\r\n\r\nStudents raved about this course. More than one student proclaimed that it was the best class they had taken at Penn. Many found the course \u201cintellectually stimulating,\u201d that it required \u201cindependent and critical thinking,\u201d and that they learned a lot from it. One student did say that \u201cthe pace of the lectures could be faster and a more in depth historical perspective would be nice,\u201d while another student yearned for more discussion. Both these students were in the minority. \r\n\r\nStudents unanimously applauded Professor Kors\u2019 teaching style. Not a single critique was given. All the students found him to be \u201cbrilliant, inspiring, passionate, an amazing lecturer.\u201d They admired his expertise and in depth knowledge about his subject matter and the fact that he \u201cgenuinely cares about his students.\u201d General sentiment can be summed up in one student\u2019s proclamation: \u201cKors is as good as it gets. He is a professor who you\u2019ll want to take at least one course with before graduating.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe distribution of grades in this course was a point of concern for students. They wanted the distribution to become more balanced and not have the final worth 75% of their grade. 300-400 level courses are on special topics and are more advanced. They often presuppose some basic knowledge in the field and should be more difficult courses than courses at the 1-199 levels.
