{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5729"}, "description": "The aims of this course are threefold: to introduce students to some signature literary and cultural texts form roughly the post-Stalin era to the present, to equip them with relevant theoretical approaches and concerns, and finally, to offer a space where they can develop their own research projects. A major theme will be the relations between \"Russian\" literature and history, in which literature is not only a mimesis of the historical process but often an active agent. Throughout, we will be particularly attentive to the periphery of literature. In the first place, this means an expanded geography, the inclusion of non-Russian Soviet and emigre writers before and after 1991, as well as an effort to theorize their structural position. Secondly, we will adopt the late Formalists' understanding of literary periphery as the genres, cultural forms, institutions, and phenomena that abutted the literary field and affected its processes. Depending on student interest, our attention to these objects of inquiry could be directed toward bardic song and the later lyric-centric Russian rock, samizdat and literary internet, thick journals and literary prizes, Soviet-era dissidence and today's protest culture. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "From Late-Soviet to Non-Soviet Literature and Culture", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30976/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "From Late-Soviet to Non-Soviet Literature and Culture", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-528-401", "path": "/courses/30976/sections/401", "id": "30976-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-528-401", "COML-528-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/30976/sections/401/reviews/1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "first_name": "KEVIN M.F.", "last_name": "PLATT", "id": "1707-KEVIN-M-F--PLATT", "name": "KEVIN M.F.
