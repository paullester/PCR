We will examine the evolution of the way in which people have thought about matter and its transformations; from the manufacturing of explosives to dyestuffs to pharmaceuticals and perfumes. We will do some simple experiments that demonstrate some of these principles. We will follow the development of the chemical sciences from the works of early alchemists to Renaissance (Newton andBoyle) scientists and modern thinkers (Priestly, Lavoisier, Dalton, Mendeleev and others). This class, which is designed for non-science as well as potentialscience majors, will involve discussions on readings, as well as field trips tosome Philadelphia locations that are notable in the history of chemistry. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "FROM ALCHEMY TO NANOSCI: From Alchemy to Nanoscience: A History of Chemistry", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28654/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "FROM ALCHEMY TO NANOSCI: From Alchemy to Nanoscience: A History of Chemistry", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CHEM-025-301", "path": "/courses/28654/sections/301", "id": "28654-301", "aliases": ["CHEM-025-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/28654/sections/301/reviews/1312-JEFFREY-D--WINKLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1312-JEFFREY-D--WINKLER", "first_name": "JEFFREY D.", "last_name": "WINKLER", "id": "1312-JEFFREY-D--WINKLER", "name": "JEFFREY D.
