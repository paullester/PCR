He is very organized and his lecture notes and old exams are helpful in preparing students for current exams. Professor Topp is an excellent instructor. He took the time to explain concepts to students in his office hours and was always very approachable and helpful.\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the Physical World Sector.
