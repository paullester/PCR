{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/256"}, "description": "A basic laboratory course in which both the theoretical and practical aspects of a variety of organic reactions and multistep syntheses are emphasized. Modern chromatographic, instrumental, and spectroscopic techniques are applied to experimental organic chemistry. Course should be taken concurrently with CHEM 242 or in the semester immediately following. For safety reasons students will not be permitted to wear contact lenses in the laboratory. \n\nPLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING: For the Summer and LPS offering of CHEM 245, it is a 2-semester course. Part 1 is taken in the first term for 0.0 CU and then Part 2 is taken in the second term immediately following the first for 1.0 CU. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "EXPERIMTL ORGAN CHEM I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18394/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "3.42", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "3.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.56", "rCommAbility": "3.39", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "EXPERIMTL ORGAN CHEM I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-245-001", "path": "/courses/18394/sections/001", "id": "18394-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-245-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 132, "path": "/courses/18394/sections/001/reviews/239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "first_name": "CLELIA W", "last_name": "MALLORY", "id": "239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "name": "CLELIA W MALLORY"}, "num_reviewers": 125, "id": "18394-001-239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-245", "path": "/courses/18394", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18394/sections", "values": [{"name": "EXPERIMTL ORGAN CHEM I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-245-001", "path": "/courses/18394/sections/001", "id": "18394-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-245-001"]}]}, "id": 18394, "aliases": ["CHEM-245"]}
