It uses \u201cExperimental Organic Chemistry\u201d by Gilbert as its main textbook. It covers topics including modern chromatographic, instrumental and spectroscopic techniques.\r\n\r\nMost students said that they learned a lot from the class and were \u201cproud\u201d of their \u201cprogress.\u201d However, one point of contention was that most students learned a lot from the readings and not so much from the professor.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mallory was outstanding, according to many students. The lectures were extremely beneficial for the class, though some students had problems with the labs. Many students specifically said \u201cDr. Mallory has perfected this course.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll the students thought the class was far too much work for one credit units. It involved 9 hours of class time, no including time spent on homework. While intensive, the class was targeted specifically for Chemistry majors and had an extremely steep curve, making it difficult to get a good grade.", "num_students": 122, "path": "/courses/17078/sections/001/reviews/239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "first_name": "CLELIA W", "last_name": "MALLORY", "id": "239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "name": "CLELIA W MALLORY"}, "num_reviewers": 115, "id": "17078-001-239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY"}]
