An additional prerequisite for the course is Chem 241.  \r\n\r\nMany of the students in the course were upperclassmen, and most took it as part of the premed and major requirement. As for the TAs, most students felt that they were very helpful and knowledgeable.  Students were also pleased with Professor Mallory, describing her as \u201cawesome,\u201d and \u201cexcellent.\u201d  As one student commented, \u201cDr. Mallory led a very interesting, educational lab course.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students found the course to be very work-intensive. Many complaints centered on the lab reports, which required what some thought an excessive amount of writing.  One student described them as \u201cpainful.\u201d  However, students believed that they had learned a considerable amount from the lab experience.  The lab fee for the course was $300.\r\n", "num_students": 115, "path": "/courses/19888/sections/001/reviews/239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "first_name": "CLELIA W", "last_name": "MALLORY", "id": "239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY", "name": "CLELIA W MALLORY"}, "num_reviewers": 112, "id": "19888-001-239-CLELIA-W-MALLORY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-245", "path": "/courses/19888", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19888/sections", "values": [{"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-245-001", "path": "/courses/19888/sections/001", "id": "19888-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-245-001"]}]}, "id": 19888, "aliases": ["CHEM-245"]}
