Students are introduced to modern\r\nlaboratory techniques and participate in experimental activities that promote the\r\ndevelopment of basic and advanced science process skills. This course focuses on\r\nunderstanding and analyzing substances and reactions and investigating chemical\r\ninteractions. Aspects of qualitative and quantitative analysis, determination of chemical\r\nand physical properties, and chemical synthesis are covered.\r\nMost students felt that this class was uninteresting and that there was too much\r\nwork involved for a .5 credit course. A majority also thought that the practical and\r\nwritten exams were too difficult and that they covered concepts that were not heavily\r\ndiscussed in lab or lecture. Some students also felt that this class had a lack of\r\norganization.\r\nOverall, students said that Professor Maeyer was \u201ca great instructor.\u201d She\r\nplanned interesting demonstrations for every lecture that complemented the labs. They\r\nwere pleased that she was very accessible and answered questions in lecture that helped\r\nwith the weekly lab reports. Professor Maeyer would also extend report deadlines and\r\nmove around exam dates if her course exam conflicted with the CHEM 102 exams.\r\nThe prerequisite for this class is CHEM 053. It is often taken in conjunction of\r\nCHEM 102. This class is recommended for freshman, but they should be prepared for a\r\n\u201cserious time commitment.\u201d", "num_students": 65, "path": "/courses/24109/sections/001/reviews/4760-JENINE-MAEYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4760-JENINE-MAEYER", "first_name": "JENINE", "last_name": "MAEYER", "id": "4760-JENINE-MAEYER", "name": "JENINE MAEYER"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "24109-001-4760-JENINE-MAEYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-054", "path": "/courses/24109", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24109/sections", "values": [{"name": "GEN CHEM LAB 2", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-054-001", "path": "/courses/24109/sections/001", "id": "24109-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-054-001"]}]}, "id": 24109, "aliases": ["CHEM-054"]}
