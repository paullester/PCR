{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/259"}, "description": "A detailed treatment of the theory and application of modern physical methods for the elucidation of structure and mechanism in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. An introduction to symmetry and group theory is followed by the application of these concepts to vibrational and electronic spectroscopy of inorganic complexes. Magnetic resonance is discussed in detail, including topics such as EPR, fourier transform methods, dynamic systems, and 2-dimensional NMR. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14215/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.56", "rCommAbility": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-462-001", "path": "/courses/14215/sections/001", "id": "14215-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-462-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/14215/sections/001/reviews/242-BRADFORD-WAYLAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/242-BRADFORD-WAYLAND", "first_name": "BRADFORD", "last_name": "WAYLAND", "id": "242-BRADFORD-WAYLAND", "name": "BRADFORD WAYLAND"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "14215-001-242-BRADFORD-WAYLAND"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-462", "path": "/courses/14215", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14215/sections", "values": [{"name": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-462-001", "path": "/courses/14215/sections/001", "id": "14215-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-462-001"]}]}, "id": 14215, "aliases": ["CHEM-462"]}
