This is a fundamental course in organic chemistry based upon the modern concepts of structure and mechanism of reactions. \r\n\r\nStudents thought the course content was mostly memorization of obscure reagents and reactions as opposed to the more intuitive nature of CHEM241. Students also found the course to be rather disorganized. One student said that all the information they learned, however, was very useful knowledge to have since it applies directly to everything around you. Nonetheless, some thought that a decent amount of the material they needed to know was sometimes too specific and not relevant to the big picture. \r\n\r\nStudents said Professor Joullie has a wealth of knowledge and experience. However, \u201cher enthusiasm for chemistry does not always translate into great communication of that material to her students.\u201d Another student wrote that \u201cShe also was not always clear about what material would turn up on exams, which often required several questions from students to find out what would be tested.\u201d Students also got the sense that Professor Joullie wanted her students to really learn and do well, and this is something that they appreciated.  One student said she was \u201calways available for office hours and extremely willing to discuss any issues/provide help.\u201d Students found that her lecture style was not for everyone, and they recommend sitting in on her lectures before deciding on the class as some had trouble understanding her accent.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisite for this course is CHEM 241.  Students found overall that this class requires a lot of work and constant studying. Students found that the exams in this course were more difficult than expected. However, students appreciated the format (4 midterms and a final), where you can drop your lowest grade. Students found this course to be very hard because of the amount of knowledge that they had to master. Many students thought the amount of material in this course was overwhelming and complained that not enough practice problems of exam-difficulty were provided. However, Professor Joullie gave ample time for her exams, which students appreciated.", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/27100/sections/002/reviews/234-MADELEINE-M-JOULLIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/234-MADELEINE-M-JOULLIE", "first_name": "MADELEINE M", "last_name": "JOULLIE", "id": "234-MADELEINE-M-JOULLIE", "name": "MADELEINE M JOULLIE"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "27100-002-234-MADELEINE-M-JOULLIE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.58", "rDifficulty": "3.64", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.64", "rReadingsValue": "3.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.79"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "CHEM-242-003", "path": "/courses/27100/sections/003", "id": "27100-003", "aliases": ["CHEM-242-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/27100/sections/003/reviews/236-AMOS-BRITTAIN-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/236-AMOS-BRITTAIN-SMITH", "first_name": "AMOS BRITTAIN", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "236-AMOS-BRITTAIN-SMITH", "name": "AMOS BRITTAIN SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "27100-003-236-AMOS-BRITTAIN-SMITH"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "3.68", "rStimulateInterest": "3.39", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "3.68", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.45", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHEM-242-601", "path": "/courses/27100/sections/601", "id": "27100-601", "aliases": ["CHEM-242-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 84, "path": "/courses/27100/sections/601/reviews/5718-JASON-SCHMINK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5718-JASON-SCHMINK", "first_name": "JASON", "last_name": "SCHMINK", "id": "5718-JASON-SCHMINK", "name": "JASON SCHMINK"}, "num_reviewers": 76, "id": "27100-601-5718-JASON-SCHMINK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-242", "path": "/courses/27100", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27100/sections", "values": [{"name": "ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-242-001", "path": "/courses/27100/sections/001", "id": "27100-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-242-001"]}, {"name": "ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "CHEM-242-002", "path": "/courses/27100/sections/002", "id": "27100-002", "aliases": ["CHEM-242-002"]}, {"name": "ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "CHEM-242-003", "path": "/courses/27100/sections/003", "id": "27100-003", "aliases": ["CHEM-242-003"]}, {"name": "ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHEM-242-601", "path": "/courses/27100/sections/601", "id": "27100-601", "aliases": ["CHEM-242-601"]}]}, "id": 27100, "aliases": ["CHEM-242"]}
