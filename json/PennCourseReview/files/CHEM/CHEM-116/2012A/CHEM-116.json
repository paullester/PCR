The course was described as \u201ca good challenge.\u201d It was highly based in mathematics, emphasizing derivations and the understanding of chemical formulas.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe majority of students found Professor Subotnik to be struggling with communication at the beginning of the semester, but many found that this improved as the semester progressed. Many students praised Professor Subotnik for \u201calways seeking feedback\u201d about his teaching, saying that Professor Subotnik was \u201cextremely open to listening\u201d and \u201cwilling to clarify any confusion.\u201d Students called Professor Subotnik \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d \u201centhusiastic,\u201d and \u201csincere,\u201d as well as helpful in office hours. However, many felt that he did not plan ahead enough and that he had trouble simplifying the material for the students.\r\n\r\nStudents found this course to be challenging and the exams to be very difficult, even \u201cexcessively rigorous.\u201d The students recommended this class only to intended chemistry or biochemistry majors. The prerequisite for this course is Advanced High School Chemistry (AP or equivalent).", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/27096/sections/001/reviews/5595-JOSEPH-ELI-SUBOTNIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5595-JOSEPH-ELI-SUBOTNIK", "first_name": "JOSEPH ELI", "last_name": "SUBOTNIK", "id": "5595-JOSEPH-ELI-SUBOTNIK", "name": "JOSEPH ELI SUBOTNIK"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "27096-001-5595-JOSEPH-ELI-SUBOTNIK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-116", "path": "/courses/27096", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27096/sections", "values": [{"name": "HONORS CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-116-001", "path": "/courses/27096/sections/001", "id": "27096-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-116-001"]}]}, "id": 27096, "aliases": ["CHEM-116"]}
