The first term emphasizes the understanding of chemical reactions through atomic and molecular structure. This is a university level course, treating the material in sufficient depth so that students can solve chemical problems and can understand the principles involved in their solution. It includes an introduction to condensed matter. This course is suitable for majors or non-majors and is recommended to satisfy either major or preprofessional requirements for general chemistry. This course is presented for students with high school chemistry and calculus. Students with a lesser background than this should take Chemistry 100. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "GENERAL CHEMISTRY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25742/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.36", "rDifficulty": "3.48", "rStimulateInterest": "1.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.26", "rCourseQuality": "1.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.97", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.05", "rCommAbility": "1.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.15"}, "section": {"name": "GENERAL CHEMISTRY I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-101-001", "path": "/courses/25742/sections/001", "id": "25742-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-101-001"]}, "comments": "CHEM101 is an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of chemistry and their applications in the chemical and other closely-related fields.

However, one student remarked that the course was beneficial, \u201ca student can really learn a lot about chemistry.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to many students, Professor Topp was incredibly accessible and \u201ceager to help.\u201d Most students were \u201camazed with how quickly he responded to emails and answered questions in great and satisfying detail.\u201d Many students liked that Professor Topp was \u201calways prepared for lectures\u201d and was \u201cefficient in his explanations.\u201d However, some students explained that Professor Topp\u2019s teaching techniques sometimes \u201cfailed to stimulate student interest,\u201d thus, lectures could be \u201cquite boring.\u201d While many students found his \u201cvery detailed\u201d PowerPoint slides to be helpful in that they \u201cdealt with the detailed mechanism of the principles along with relevant sample calculations,\u201d but some students found them \u201creally hard to understand because they contained long sentences and few graphics.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students felt that if one did not already have a strong background in chemistry, one was \u201cat a strong disadvantage in this course.\u201d There were three midterms and a final and students appreciated that they were able to drop their lowest exam grade. The majority of students found the exams to be extremely difficult and believed them to be \u201cwritten so that students wouldn\u2019t finish.\u201d Though some students felt that the exams were unrepresentative in that they were merely a test of how fast they could write, other students believed that if one was willing to really put in the time and effort, he or she would get a good grade.", "num_students": 131, "path": "/courses/25742/sections/001/reviews/1318-MICHAEL-RICHARD-TOPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1318-MICHAEL-RICHARD-TOPP", "first_name": "MICHAEL RICHARD", "last_name": "TOPP", "id": "1318-MICHAEL-RICHARD-TOPP", "name": "MICHAEL RICHARD TOPP"}, "num_reviewers": 118, "id": "25742-001-1318-MICHAEL-RICHARD-TOPP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-101", "path": "/courses/25742", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25742/sections", "values": [{"name": "GENERAL CHEMISTRY I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-101-001", "path": "/courses/25742/sections/001", "id": "25742-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-101-001"]}]}, "id": 25742, "aliases": ["CHEM-101"]}
