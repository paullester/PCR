But, otherwise\r\nthe subject matter is interesting.\r\nStudents found Dr. Rappe's teaching style to be very effective. He clearly knew\r\nhis stuff, but he sometimes went through things very fast. Another student said that\r\nRappe was the best instructor this course could possibly have. The information was very\r\nobscure and hard to grasp, and he refused to move on until he was convinced that most of\r\nthe class had some understanding of what is going on. Students did not like that professor\r\nRappe often had to hold classes via Skype due to his schedule.\r\nThe prerequisites for this course include CHEM 102, MATH 114, and PHYS 150.\r\nStudents warn that a strong mathematical background is required. Students who are not\r\nengineers had much more difficulty mastering the material.\r\n*Based on the 10 student reviews", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/24113/sections/001/reviews/246-ANDREW-M--RAPPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/246-ANDREW-M--RAPPE", "first_name": "ANDREW M.", "last_name": "RAPPE", "id": "246-ANDREW-M--RAPPE", "name": "ANDREW M.
