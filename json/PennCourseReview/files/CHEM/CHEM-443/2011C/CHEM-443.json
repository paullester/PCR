Study of important synthetic reactions including: oxidations, reductions, and methods for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, with an emphasis in chemoselectivity, stereoselectivity and asymmetric synthesis. Survey of modern methods for the synthesis of small, medium and large ring systems. Analysis of modern synthetic strategies, with illustrative examples from total synthesis of natural and unnatural products. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ORGANIC REACTIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24121/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.09", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "2.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "1.80", "rInstructorQuality": "1.91"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANIC REACTIONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-443-001", "path": "/courses/24121/sections/001", "id": "24121-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-443-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/24121/sections/001/reviews/5305-DAVID-M--CHENOWETH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5305-DAVID-M--CHENOWETH", "first_name": "DAVID M.", "last_name": "CHENOWETH", "id": "5305-DAVID-M--CHENOWETH", "name": "DAVID M.
