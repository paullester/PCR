The concepts are fairly straightforward.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Maeyer received mixed reviews from her students. Some felt that she was hard to reach: \u201cShe rarely responded to emails and was always late to office hours.\u201d However, \u201cshe was very helpful in answering questions in class\u201d and was described as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cexcellent and engaging.\u201d At least one student felt Professor Maeyer \u201cmade me think about majoring\u201d in chemistry. She was praised for \u201cwalking among us as we performed our experiments in-lab to monitor our progress and let us ask questions.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents felt that there was \u201cWAY too much work for a half-credit course,\u201d and that material on the lab practicals had not been covered in class. This course is a co-requisite of CHEM 101.\r\n", "num_students": 119, "path": "/courses/21391/sections/001/reviews/4760-JENINE-MAEYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4760-JENINE-MAEYER", "first_name": "JENINE", "last_name": "MAEYER", "id": "4760-JENINE-MAEYER", "name": "JENINE MAEYER"}, "num_reviewers": 104, "id": "21391-001-4760-JENINE-MAEYER"}]
