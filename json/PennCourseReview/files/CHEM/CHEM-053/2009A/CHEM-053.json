Chemistry 101 is the co-requisite; if a student withdraws from or drops from a co-requisite course, he/she must also withdraw from or drop the laboratory course. There is a $150 lab fee for CHEM-053. &#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents found the course content to be as expected for an introductory laboratory course.

CHEM-101, the co-requisite course, fulfills the physical world sector and is suitable for both majors and non-majors with high school chemistry and calculus. Students with at least a high school chemistry and calculus background should be prepared for this course; otherwise, lower level Chemistry classes are recommended.", "num_students": 129, "path": "/courses/15450/sections/001/reviews/2072-SUSAN-R-PHILLIPS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2072-SUSAN-R-PHILLIPS", "first_name": "SUSAN R", "last_name": "PHILLIPS", "id": "2072-SUSAN-R-PHILLIPS", "name": "SUSAN R PHILLIPS"}, "num_reviewers": 126, "id": "15450-001-2072-SUSAN-R-PHILLIPS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-053", "path": "/courses/15450", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15450/sections", "values": [{"name": "GEN CHEM LAB I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-053-001", "path": "/courses/15450/sections/001", "id": "15450-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-053-001"]}]}, "id": 15450, "aliases": ["CHEM-053"]}
