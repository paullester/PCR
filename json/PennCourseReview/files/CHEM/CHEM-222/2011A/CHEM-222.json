It covers principles and applications of thermodynamics, and a molecular-based understanding of macroscopic properties. \r\n\r\nStudents found the course to be a \u201cgood course for basic thermodynamics.\u201d Material was presented \u201cmuch better than Chem 221.\u201d The PowerPoints were \u201cextremely helpful in putting together the material\u201d from lecture and the textbook. Some students felt that \u201cindependent study was the key to this course.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Gai \u201cis able to stimulate interest throughout the class by humorous, yet appropriate analogies,\u201d although some felt that his analogies were \u201cnot very helpful, but very entertaining.\u201d One student remarked that Professor Gai \u201cis pretty good at teaching the course material.\u201d While many students were pleased with lecture, one student found it to be \u201cunbearably boring.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHEM 221 and PHYS 151 are pre-requisites for this class. For each midterm, Professor Gai provided a practice midterm from the previous year. \r\nNote: Less than eight students reviewed this course.\r\n", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/21397/sections/001/reviews/225-FENG-GAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/225-FENG-GAI", "first_name": "FENG", "last_name": "GAI", "id": "225-FENG-GAI", "name": "FENG GAI"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "21397-001-225-FENG-GAI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-222", "path": "/courses/21397", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21397/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-222-001", "path": "/courses/21397/sections/001", "id": "21397-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-222-001"]}]}, "id": 21397, "aliases": ["CHEM-222"]}
