{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1729"}, "description": "Synthetic metals - polymers (\"plastics\") which have the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of metals while retaining the flexibility and processibility characteristic of conventional polymers have recently come of age. The basic concepts of modern solid state chemistry will be illustrated using synthetic metals and also semiconductors such as silicon together with selected applications in electronic devices, such as, rectifiers, solar cells, etc. Suggested for science majors with at least one year of High School Chemistry. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SYNTHETIC METALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2725/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.89", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.56", "rInstructorAccess": "2.56", "rReadingsValue": "1.89", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SYNTHETIC METALS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CHEM-023-301", "path": "/courses/2725/sections/301", "id": "2725-301", "aliases": ["CHEM-023-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/2725/sections/301/reviews/243-DONALD-H--BERRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/243-DONALD-H--BERRY", "first_name": "DONALD H.", "last_name": "BERRY", "id": "243-DONALD-H--BERRY", "name": "DONALD H.
