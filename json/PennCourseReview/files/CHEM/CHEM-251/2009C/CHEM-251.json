It serves as an introduction to biochemistry, covering many topics including the structure of biological macromolecules and their mechanism of action, intermediary metabolism, and the chemical basis of information transfer. The main textbook is \u201cThe Fundamental of Biochemistry\u201d by Voet.\r\n\r\nMany students were skeptical about the amount they learned in the class. Others claimed that the course was a good precursor to Biochemistry and useful for those taking Chemistry concurrently.\r\n\r\nThe professor received mixed reviews. Many were extremely positive, commenting that the professor is \u201cpassionate\u201d and the course is \u201cwell taught\u201d and \u201cwell structured.\u201d There were a few negative comments, particularly regarding the professor\u2019s accessibility.\r\n\r\nStudents said the course required a lot of work and would only recommend it to chemistry or biochemistry majors. Students also added that the cheat sheet was extremely important as Professor Cooperman focused a lot on minutiae in his questions.", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/17080/sections/001/reviews/229-BARRY-S--COOPERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/229-BARRY-S--COOPERMAN", "first_name": "BARRY S.", "last_name": "COOPERMAN", "id": "229-BARRY-S--COOPERMAN", "name": "BARRY S.
