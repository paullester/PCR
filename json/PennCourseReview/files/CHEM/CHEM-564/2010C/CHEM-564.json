{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1741"}, "description": "This course is focused on molecular species that contain metal-carbon bonds, and the role of these compounds in catalytic processes and organic synthesis. Aspects of the synthesis, structure and reactivity of important classes of organometallic compounds such as metallo alkyl, aryl, alkene, alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes are surveyed for the d and f block metals. Emphasis is placed on general patterns of reactivity and recurring themes for reaction mechanisms. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ORGANOMETALLICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22783/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "3.44", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.65", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "1.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.83", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANOMETALLICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-564-001", "path": "/courses/22783/sections/001", "id": "22783-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-564-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/22783/sections/001/reviews/1315-PATRICK-J--WALSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1315-PATRICK-J--WALSH", "first_name": "PATRICK J.", "last_name": "WALSH", "id": "1315-PATRICK-J--WALSH", "name": "PATRICK J.
