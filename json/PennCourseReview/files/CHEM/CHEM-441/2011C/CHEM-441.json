While one student described her as\r\n\u201cvery knowledgeable,\u201d another found her to be \u201cquite abrasive\u201d to students and an\r\nineffective teacher when working out problems on the board. One also expressed\r\nwishing that Dr. Kozlowski \u201cspent more time explaining the logic\u201d behind the problems\r\nbecause they were difficult to follow during class and required significant individual\r\neffort to understand outside of class.\r\nThis course requires Chemistry 242 as a prerequisite.
