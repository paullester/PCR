{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/246"}, "description": "The course will discuss exciting recent research discoveries that are providing us with ways of visualizing chemical reactions and other structural changes. The course will provide some highlights of laser chemistry and other new technologies focused on structure determination and real time measurements of chemical change that are making an impact on our ability to visualize molecular processes and manipulate molecules. Applications will be both chemical and biological. The course is intended for those excited by scientific discovery who are also science majors with at least a High School AP course in chemistry, and ideally, AP physics. There will be no specific textbook. Readings will be original comments and papers from the scientific literature. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "MOLECULES IN MOTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/246/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "MOLECULES IN MOTION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CHEM-024-301", "path": "/courses/246/sections/301", "id": "246-301", "aliases": ["CHEM-024-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/246/sections/301/reviews/223-ROBIN-M--HOCHSTRASSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/223-ROBIN-M--HOCHSTRASSER", "first_name": "ROBIN M.", "last_name": "HOCHSTRASSER", "id": "223-ROBIN-M--HOCHSTRASSER", "name": "ROBIN M.
