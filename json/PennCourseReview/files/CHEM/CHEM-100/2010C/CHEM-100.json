{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4904"}, "description": "This course serves as a preliminary to Chemistry 101 and will focys on providing a solid introduction to those concepts; ideas that are necessary for Chemistry 101. There is a strong emphasis on problem-solving that is fundamental to all physical science. Topics will include: introduction to fundamental chemical ideas and their application to chemical reactions, stoichiometry and ideal gases. Also, an overview of the periodic table and classical ideas of chemical bonding using Lewis structures. Topics from mathematics and physics that are necessary to chemical problem-solving will also be included as needed. This course is especially recommended for those whofeel that their pre-college exposure to chemistry warrants a more structured transition to Chemistry 101. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEM: FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEMISTRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22765/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEM: FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEMISTRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-100-001", "path": "/courses/22765/sections/001", "id": "22765-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-100-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/22765/sections/001/reviews/226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO", "first_name": "ANTHONY J", "last_name": "PIETROVITO", "id": "226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO", "name": "ANTHONY J PIETROVITO"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "22765-001-226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-100", "path": "/courses/22765", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22765/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEM: FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEMISTRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-100-001", "path": "/courses/22765/sections/001", "id": "22765-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-100-001"]}]}, "id": 22765, "aliases": ["CHEM-100"]}
