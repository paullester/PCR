The amount of material that was covered was said to be \u201castronomical.\u201d\r\nMany students said that Professor Pietrovito was the \u201cbest\u201d professor they ever\r\nhad. They said he was tough, but fair. One student said, \u201cHe is so committed to seeing us\r\nlearn and making sure we understand the material as well as study tactics. I've learned\r\nnot just about Chemistry this semester, but also about how to learn.\u201d Professor Pietrovito\r\nis described as a passionate and dedicated professor. He has a unique ability to spark\r\ninterest in chemistry beyond what is required for the course.\r\nThis course is designed for students with a lesser background in chemistry and/or\r\nmathematics. It is suitable for chemistry majors, non-majors, or pre-professional students.\r\nStudents said the course had a lot of work. In addition, they found it to be extremely\r\nchallenging. The tests are designed to be very difficult and normally the class average\r\nranges anywhere from 50 to 60 according to one student.", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/24105/sections/601/reviews/226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO", "first_name": "ANTHONY J", "last_name": "PIETROVITO", "id": "226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO", "name": "ANTHONY J PIETROVITO"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "24105-601-226-ANTHONY-J-PIETROVITO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-001", "path": "/courses/24105", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24105/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRODUCTORY CHEM I", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHEM-001-601", "path": "/courses/24105/sections/601", "id": "24105-601", "aliases": ["CHEM-001-601"]}]}, "id": 24105, "aliases": ["CHEM-001"]}
