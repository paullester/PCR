The first term emphasizes the understanding of chemical reactions through atomic and molecular structure.  This is a university level course, treating the material in sufficient depth so that students can solve chemical problems and can understand the principles involved in their solution.  It includes an introduction to condensed matter. This course is suitable for majors or non-majors and is recommended to satisfy either major or pre-professional requirements for general chemistry.  This course is presented for students with high school chemistry and calculus. Students with a lesser background than this should take Chemistry 100.\r\n\r\n\tOverall, students found this course to be \u201cvery challenging.\u201d Lectures were found to be \u201cdry\u201d and \u201cnot helpful at times.\u201d Several students remarked that the course required teaching oneself from the book.
