{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4199"}, "description": "Introduction to fundamental concepts of programming and computer science for students who have little or no experience in these areas. Principles of modern object-oriented programming languages: abstraction, types, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. Basic algorithmic techniques and informal complexity analysis. Graphical user interfaces. Substantial programming assignments in Java. This course is for students who do not have an academic background in computer science and who are not pursuing the Master's in Computer Information Technology and who are not graduate students in the CIS Department. Students in SEAS graduate programs such as EE, TCOM, BIOT, MEAM , & MSE, as well as students outside SEAS, such as those in Cell & Molecular Biology (CAMB) and Genomics & Computational Biology (GCB) in the Medical School, as well as graduate students from other disciplines in the University will find this course useful. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "PROG LANG AND TECHNIQUES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28738/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rTAQuality": "3.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.72", "rRecommendMajor": "2.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.81", "rWorkRequired": "3.03", "rInstructorAccess": "2.52", "rReadingsValue": "2.52", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "2.68", "rInstructorQuality": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG AND TECHNIQUES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIT-590-001", "path": "/courses/28738/sections/001", "id": "28738-001", "aliases": ["CIT-590-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/28738/sections/001/reviews/6250-ANTHONY-WEST", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6250-ANTHONY-WEST", "first_name": "ANTHONY", "last_name": "WEST", "id": "6250-ANTHONY-WEST", "name": "ANTHONY WEST"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "28738-001-6250-ANTHONY-WEST"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIT-590", "path": "/courses/28738", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28738/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROG LANG AND TECHNIQUES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIT-590-001", "path": "/courses/28738/sections/001", "id": "28738-001", "aliases": ["CIT-590-001"]}]}, "id": 28738, "aliases": ["CIT-590"]}
