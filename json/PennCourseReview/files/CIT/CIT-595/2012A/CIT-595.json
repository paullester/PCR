Students thought that the course provided an informative and broad overview to the various topics in the in the field. Particularly, \u201cthe coverage of concurrent programming was timely and extremely useful.\u201d However, students hoped that they had \u201cmoved on [more] quickly for those subjects that [were] conceptually easy,\u201d and delved deeper into certain topics, since the pace of the course was a bit too slow at times. Some noted that they learnt a lot from doing the final project and would even recommend a larger one. The articles assigned were also quite helpful.\r\n\r\nThe majority of students liked Professor Mongan. They reported that Professor Mongan was nice and helpful both in and out of class. Furthermore, students liked the enthusiasm that he had for teaching and thought he did a great job of \u201clending practical tips in addition to providing a strong theoretical background.\u201d Some also complimented him for providing good notes and diagrams.\r\n\r\nThis course is part of a two-course sequence starting with CIT 593. The homework assignments were tough but rewarding. However, materials and due dates \u201cwere spread between the course website and Blackboard,\u201d which resulted in some confusion.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/27182/sections/001/reviews/6074-WILLIAM-M--MONGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6074-WILLIAM-M--MONGAN", "first_name": "WILLIAM M.", "last_name": "MONGAN", "id": "6074-WILLIAM-M--MONGAN", "name": "WILLIAM M.
