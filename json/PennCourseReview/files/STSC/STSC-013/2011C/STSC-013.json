{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5271"}, "description": "The Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries created the intellectual, philosophical, social, and institutional foundations of modern science, fundamentally changing the way we see the universe and our place within it. In this seminar we will take a biographical approach, exploring that revolution by examining the lives, ideas and achievements of some of the period's most renowed and consequential thinkers, among them Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Bacon, Descartes, and Newton. In the course of our biographical explorations, we will also consider the rise of scientific societies, the \"scientific method,\" \"experimental philosophy,\" the impact of new technologies (including the telescope and the microscope), and the politial and religious implications of the new scientific world view. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25176/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "3.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.20", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.20", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-013-301", "path": "/courses/25176/sections/301", "id": "25176-301", "aliases": ["STSC-013-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/25176/sections/301/reviews/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "first_name": "MARK B", "last_name": "ADAMS", "id": "663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "name": "MARK B ADAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "25176-301-663-MARK-B-ADAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-013", "path": "/courses/25176", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25176/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-013-301", "path": "/courses/25176/sections/301", "id": "25176-301", "aliases": ["STSC-013-301"]}]}, "id": 25176, "aliases": ["STSC-013"]}
