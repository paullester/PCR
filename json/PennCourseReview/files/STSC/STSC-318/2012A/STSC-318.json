{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5480"}, "description": "Experients on living material are now controversial for ethical reasons (think stem cells, animal experimentation and animal rights, etc), but the scientific merit of experimenting onthe living is rarely challenged. We tend to take for granted that experiments are the best way to understand biology, but inthe nineteenth century, the opposite was true. Why has this changed, and what are he implications of the change? Is the appearance of consensus around the role of experiment in biology simply a false impression? These are the sorts of questions that this course will explore through popular, scientific, and historical literature. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "EXPERI IN MOD LIFE SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28205/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "EXPERI IN MOD LIFE SCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-318-301", "path": "/courses/28205/sections/301", "id": "28205-301", "aliases": ["STSC-318-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/28205/sections/301/reviews/6185-CARIN-B-CARUSO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6185-CARIN-B-CARUSO", "first_name": "CARIN B", "last_name": "CARUSO", "id": "6185-CARIN-B-CARUSO", "name": "CARIN B CARUSO"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "28205-301-6185-CARIN-B-CARUSO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-318", "path": "/courses/28205", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28205/sections", "values": [{"name": "EXPERI IN MOD LIFE SCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-318-301", "path": "/courses/28205/sections/301", "id": "28205-301", "aliases": ["STSC-318-301"]}]}, "id": 28205, "aliases": ["STSC-318"]}
