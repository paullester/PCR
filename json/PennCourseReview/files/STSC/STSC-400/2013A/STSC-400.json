{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5055"}, "description": "This is a capstone seminar for STSC maors, and a required seminar for any STSC junior who wishes to write a senior thesis for honors in the major. It is designed to provide the tools necessary to undertake original research by guiding students through the research and writing process. Students will produce either a polished proposal for a senior thesis project, or a completed research paper by the end of the term. Although each student will work on a different topic, the class will focus on general aspects of historical, and social scientific research and guide students through a close reading of key texts in science and technology studies. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "RESEARCH SEMINAR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31071/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "RESEARCH SEMINAR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-400-301", "path": "/courses/31071/sections/301", "id": "31071-301", "aliases": ["STSC-400-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/31071/sections/301/reviews/4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "first_name": "JOHN", "last_name": "TRESCH", "id": "4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "name": "JOHN TRESCH"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "31071-301-4131-JOHN-TRESCH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-400", "path": "/courses/31071", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31071/sections", "values": [{"name": "RESEARCH SEMINAR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-400-301", "path": "/courses/31071/sections/301", "id": "31071-301", "aliases": ["STSC-400-301"]}]}, "id": 31071, "aliases": ["STSC-400"]}
