{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4763"}, "description": "Stories told about the past have long been understood as moral lessons. An historical narratives have also inevitably been succeptible to partisan construction--to different readings by opposed parties. But the strength of appeals to the past is not a constant: historical experience has at some times and in some places been seen as irrelevant to selection of courses of pratical action. Today, in the United States as well as in many other parts of the world, appeals to historical precedent carry considerable weight and are made for all manner of purposes. This course will discuss the uses of history in contemporary and past situations, drawing exaples from the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "WHO OWNS THE PAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19375/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "1.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.70", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "WHO OWNS THE PAST", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-088-301", "path": "/courses/19375/sections/301", "id": "19375-301", "aliases": ["STSC-088-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/19375/sections/301/reviews/670-HENRIKA-KUKLICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/670-HENRIKA-KUKLICK", "first_name": "HENRIKA", "last_name": "KUKLICK", "id": "670-HENRIKA-KUKLICK", "name": "HENRIKA KUKLICK"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "19375-301-670-HENRIKA-KUKLICK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-088", "path": "/courses/19375", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19375/sections", "values": [{"name": "WHO OWNS THE PAST", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-088-301", "path": "/courses/19375/sections/301", "id": "19375-301", "aliases": ["STSC-088-301"]}]}, "id": 19375, "aliases": ["STSC-088"]}
