{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5479"}, "description": "Over the last two centuries, scientists have produced a broad range of knowledge about the physical world, from light to electromagnetism to atoms to nuclei, facilitating or explaining an ever increasing mastery over the natural world. Becuse of their success, these developments played an important role in forming our views of how to effectively generate knowledge of the natural world. This course will examine some of the major developments in the physical sciences during the 19th and 20th century, asking how that knowledge and the means by which it was produced related to institutions, technical practices and broader cultural knowledge and knowledge production to explore how past practices have, or have not, left their traces in later science. The course will meet twice a week for lecture and discussion. Readings will consist of Pursuing Power and Light: Technology and Physics from James Watt to Albert Einstein by Bruce J. Hunt When Physics Became King by Iwan Rhys Morus Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist by Russel McCormmach as well as articles from a course reader. Students will produce three short papers (about three pages) and a term paper (about ten pages) \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "HIST PHYS SCI 19&20TH C", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28203/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.25", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "HIST PHYS SCI 19&20TH C", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STSC-201-001", "path": "/courses/28203/sections/001", "id": "28203-001", "aliases": ["STSC-201-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/28203/sections/001/reviews/6184-BABAK-RAZZAGHE-ASHRAFI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6184-BABAK-RAZZAGHE-ASHRAFI", "first_name": "BABAK RAZZAGHE", "last_name": "ASHRAFI", "id": "6184-BABAK-RAZZAGHE-ASHRAFI", "name": "BABAK RAZZAGHE ASHRAFI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "28203-001-6184-BABAK-RAZZAGHE-ASHRAFI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-201", "path": "/courses/28203", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28203/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST PHYS SCI 19&20TH C", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "STSC-201-001", "path": "/courses/28203/sections/001", "id": "28203-001", "aliases": ["STSC-201-001"]}]}, "id": 28203, "aliases": ["STSC-201"]}
