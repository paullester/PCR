{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3972"}, "description": "Is life what you think it is? How do we draw the line that separates life fromnon-life, now and in the past? Some scientists explain the origin of life as arising from organic syntheses of biological precursors like amino acids and sugars. Others focus on the origin of the genetic code, metabolism or the cell. Inevitably, investigators trying to understand the origin of life also address the environment in which life arose. Charles Darwin suggested a warm pond; others have proposed everything from sea ice to hydrothermal vents; some conjecture life's origin on other worlds. In this seminar, we will examine how questions about the origin of life have been posed and answered from Darwin to the present, including some bizarre or overlooked experiments, arguments and observations from Darwin to the present. Along the way we will consider a bestiary of monsters, derelicts and odd-balls. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "THE ORIGINS OF LIFE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13959/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.82", "rStimulateInterest": "1.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.27", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45", "rReadingsValue": "2.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "2.64", "rInstructorQuality": "2.45"}, "section": {"name": "THE ORIGINS OF LIFE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-018-301", "path": "/courses/13959/sections/301", "id": "13959-301", "aliases": ["STSC-018-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/13959/sections/301/reviews/4132-LLYD-WELLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4132-LLYD-WELLS", "first_name": "LLYD", "last_name": "WELLS", "id": "4132-LLYD-WELLS", "name": "LLYD WELLS"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "13959-301-4132-LLYD-WELLS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-018", "path": "/courses/13959", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13959/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE ORIGINS OF LIFE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-018-301", "path": "/courses/13959/sections/301", "id": "13959-301", "aliases": ["STSC-018-301"]}]}, "id": 13959, "aliases": ["STSC-018"]}
