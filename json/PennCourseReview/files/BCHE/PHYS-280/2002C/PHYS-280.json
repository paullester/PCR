{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2073"}, "description": "Classic case studies of successful reductionistic models of complex phenomena, emphasizing the key steps of (1) making estimates, often based on dimensional analysis, (2) using them to figure out which physical variables and phenomena will be most relevant to a given system, and which may be disregarded, and (3) finding analogies to purely physical systems whose behavior is already known. The cases studied involve basic biological processes, mainly at the molecular and cellular level, in the light of ideas from physics. Topics may include entropic forces, free energy transduction at the molecular level, the structure of biopolymers, molecular motors, pattern formation (oscillation and morphogenesis), immune response, nerve impulses and neural computing, and other forms of signal transduction. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3380/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.90", "rWorkRequired": "3.05", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "3.19", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-280-401", "path": "/courses/3380/sections/401", "id": "3380-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-280-401", "PHYS-580-401", "BCHE-580-401", "BCHE-280-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/3380/sections/401/reviews/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "first_name": "PHILIP", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "name": "PHILIP NELSON"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "3380-401-1675-PHILIP-NELSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-280", "path": "/courses/3380", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3380/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-280-401", "path": "/courses/3380/sections/401", "id": "3380-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-280-401", "PHYS-580-401", "BCHE-580-401", "BCHE-280-401"]}]}, "id": 3380, "aliases": ["PHYS-280", "PHYS-580", "BCHE-580", "BCHE-280"]}
