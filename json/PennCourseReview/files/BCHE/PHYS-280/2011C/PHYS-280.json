Several students\r\ncalled this course \u201cvery relevant\u201d and a \u201cmust-take course\u201d for any science or\r\nengineering major.\r\nStudents described Professor Nelson as a great, engaging lecturer with an \u201cability\r\nto invoke interest in students.\u201d He had \u201cgreat passion\u201d for the material. Students\r\nremarked that Professor Nelson was \u201calways willing to explain things very thoroughly\u201d\r\nand that he was \u201ckeen to help.\u201d\r\nIn general, students called this a \u201ctough\u201d course. A large number of students\r\nremarked on the reliance on statistical theory, stating, \u201cmastery of statistics was necessary\r\nfor this course.\u201d Multiple students recommended Stat-430 prior to taking this course.\r\nMost students in the class found the tests to be quite difficult. Many students remarked\r\nthat there were not enough examples to prepare for the exams, especially with the more\r\ndifficult problems. One student commented that the professor was an \u201cextremely hard\r\ngrader\u201d and it was pointed out that there was little to no partial credit given on exams.", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/24981/sections/401/reviews/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "first_name": "PHILIP", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "name": "PHILIP NELSON"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "24981-401-1675-PHILIP-NELSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-280", "path": "/courses/24981", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24981/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYS MODELS BIO SYSTEMS: Physical Models of Biological Systems", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-280-401", "path": "/courses/24981/sections/401", "id": "24981-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-280-401", "BCHE-280-401"]}]}, "id": 24981, "aliases": ["PHYS-280", "BCHE-280"]}
