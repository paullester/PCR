{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2073"}, "description": "Classic case studies of successful reductionistic models of complex phenomena, emphasizing the key steps of (1) making estimates, often based on dimensional analysis, (2) using them to figure out which physical variables and phenomena will be most relevant to a given system, and which may be disregarded, and (3) finding analogies to purely physical systems whose behavior is already known. The cases studied involve basic biological processes, mainly at the molecular and cellular level, in the light of ideas from physics. Topics may include entropic forces, free energy transduction at the molecular level, the structure of biopolymers, molecular motors, pattern formation (oscillation and morphogenesis), immune response, nerve impulses and neural computing, and other forms of signal transduction. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "PHYS MODELS OF BIO SYSTE: Physical Models of Biological Systems", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13749/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "3.31", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.07", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.52", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.66", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "PHYS MODELS OF BIO SYSTE: Physical Models of Biological Systems", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-280-001", "path": "/courses/13749/sections/001", "id": "13749-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-280-001", "BCHE-280-001"]}, "comments": "Students were incredibly positive about Professor Nelson: \u201cNever have I had a professor so committed to his students or so capable of getting students excited about the subject matter\u201d one student said.
