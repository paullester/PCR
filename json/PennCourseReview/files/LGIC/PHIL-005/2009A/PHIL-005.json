His office hours were a valuable, and practically essential component of doing well in the class.\r\n\r\nThe course, while listed as a requirement for a major in philosophy, seemed largely unconnected with the rest of the philosophy major. \u201cVery little philosophy occurred,\u201d one student said. Another commented that \u201cmost of the class felt like a class in discrete math.\u201d One student mentioned that the class seemed most useful for logic, math or computer science studies. The class did require a significant amount of work outside of lecture, including regular attendance at office hours and tutorials.", "num_students": 50, "path": "/courses/16291/sections/401/reviews/946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "first_name": "SCOTT", "last_name": "WEINSTEIN", "id": "946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "name": "SCOTT WEINSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "16291-401-946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-005", "path": "/courses/16291", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16291/sections", "values": [{"name": "FORMAL LOGIC I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-005-401", "path": "/courses/16291/sections/401", "id": "16291-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-005-401", "PHIL-505-401", "LGIC-010-401"]}]}, "id": 16291, "aliases": ["PHIL-005", "PHIL-505", "LGIC-010"]}
