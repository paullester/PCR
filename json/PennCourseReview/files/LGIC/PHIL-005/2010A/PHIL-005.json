It covers ideas about truth, functional logic, quantificational logic, and logical decision problems. The course covers sections 1-41 in Warren Goldfarb's book, Deductive Logic, with supplementary material provided through lecture notes. This course may be counted as a Formal Reasoning course.\r\n\r\nStudents described PHIL005 as \u201cuseful in [their] critical thinking abilities\u201d and \u201cworthwhile,\u201d but a common mantra in their comments was that the course was \u201cvery challenging.\u201d They felt the lectures were occasionally \u201cdisorganized and confusing\u201d and that there was a lack of outside material like lecture slides or outlines.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Professor Weinstein is dedicated to his students. Almost very comment mentioned something about how he is \u201ccommitted to the understanding of his students,\u201d \u201cextremely willing to help you understand the content,\u201d or his rapport with the students. However, one student summed up the thoughts of others: \u201che's not for everyone.\u201d Students say that sometimes Professor Weinstein often has difficulty communicating the subject matter, though he knows the material \u201cfrighteningly well.\u201d The TAs were invaluable in explaining the material, and many students professed that might not have passed the class without them.\r\n\r\nThis course is definitely very challenging and moves quickly. Students mentioned the review sessions and office hours \u201care nearly obligatory\u201d and that they are the only way to finish homework. Quite a few students were taking this class as a requisite for a philosophy major or minor, and many were upperclassmen.", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/26596/sections/401/reviews/946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "first_name": "SCOTT", "last_name": "WEINSTEIN", "id": "946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN", "name": "SCOTT WEINSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "26596-401-946-SCOTT-WEINSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHIL-005", "path": "/courses/26596", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26596/sections", "values": [{"name": "FORMAL LOGIC I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHIL-005-401", "path": "/courses/26596/sections/401", "id": "26596-401", "aliases": ["PHIL-005-401", "PHIL-505-401", "LGIC-010-401"]}]}, "id": 26596, "aliases": ["PHIL-005", "PHIL-505", "LGIC-010"]}
