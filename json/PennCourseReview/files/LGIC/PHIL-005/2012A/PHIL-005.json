Topics will include truth functional logic, quantificational logic, and logical decision problems.\r\n\r\nAll students commented on the extreme difficulty and time commitment required to do well in this course.  The abstract nature of the material posed significant problems for comprehension.  Many students felt the course was too fast-paced, leaving too little time to go over important concepts due to a significant use of class time for answering questions on the problem sets.  Several students stated the need to attend TA\u2019s office hours and workshops weekly in order to receive passing grades on the problem sets and exams, which had very low average scores.  \r\n\r\nDespite being frustrated with the course itself, many students commented on Professor Weinstein\u2019s obvious intelligence and mastery of the material, in addition to his kind nature and approachability.  However, as summed up by one student, although Professor Weinstein \u201cearnestly tries to communicate the material to students, it is just too highly conceptual in nature to be explainable to the average student.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThis course satisfies the Formal Reasoning requirement.  The coursework includes weekly problem sets, as well as exams.  Many students would not recommend the course to anyone for whom it was not a requirement.
