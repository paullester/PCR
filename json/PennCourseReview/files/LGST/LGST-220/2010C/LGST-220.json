A central aim of the course is to enable students to develop a framework to address ethical challenges as they arise within and across different countries. Alternative theories about acting ethically in global environments are presented, and critical current issues are introduced and analyzed. Examples include bribery, global sourcing, environmental sustainability, social reports, intellectual property, e-commerce, and dealing with conflicting standards and values across cultures. As part of this study, the course considers non-Western ethical traditions and practices as they relate to business. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "INT'L BUSINESS ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23314/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.84", "rDifficulty": "1.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.02", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "INT'L BUSINESS ETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-220-401", "path": "/courses/23314/sections/401", "id": "23314-401", "aliases": ["LGST-220-401", "LGST-820-401"]}, "comments": "This course is a multidisciplinary, interactive study of business ethics within a global economy.

While many appreciated the opportunity to interact with \u201cstudents from all levels (undergrad, MBA, Law, etc.),\u201d one student wrote that the diversity of the student body gave the class an \u201codd\u201d dynamic.\r\n\r\n Professor Robertson received almost completely positive reviews, but several students criticized the format of class discussions. One student described course assignments as \u201cvague\u201d and grading as arbitrary. The general consensus, however, was that it was \u201ca wonderful class\u201d with a manageable workload. \r\n", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/23314/sections/401/reviews/4399-DIANA-C--ROBERTSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4399-DIANA-C--ROBERTSON", "first_name": "DIANA C.", "last_name": "ROBERTSON", "id": "4399-DIANA-C--ROBERTSON", "name": "DIANA C.
