{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/673"}, "description": "This course is a multidisciplinary, interactive study of business ethics within a global economy. A central aim of the course is to enable students to develop a framework to address ethical challenges as they arise within and across different countries. Alternative theories about acting ethically in global environments are presented, and critical current issues are introduced and analyzed. Examples include bribery, global sourcing, environmental sustainability, social reports, intellectual property, e-commerce, and dealing with conflicting standards and values across cultures. As part of this study, the course considers non-Western ethical traditions and practices as they relate to business. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "INT'L BUSINESS ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6762/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.47", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.26"}, "section": {"name": "INT'L BUSINESS ETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-220-401", "path": "/courses/6762/sections/401", "id": "6762-401", "aliases": ["LGST-220-401", "LGST-820-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/6762/sections/401/reviews/720-THOMAS-W-DUNFEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/720-THOMAS-W-DUNFEE", "first_name": "THOMAS W", "last_name": "DUNFEE", "id": "720-THOMAS-W-DUNFEE", "name": "THOMAS W DUNFEE"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "6762-401-720-THOMAS-W-DUNFEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-220", "path": "/courses/6762", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6762/sections", "values": [{"name": "INT'L BUSINESS ETHICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-220-401", "path": "/courses/6762/sections/401", "id": "6762-401", "aliases": ["LGST-220-401", "LGST-820-401"]}]}, "id": 6762, "aliases": ["LGST-220", "LGST-820"]}
