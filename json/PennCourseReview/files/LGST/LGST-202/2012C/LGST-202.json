{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/666"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to the law of corporate management and finance, focusing on large publicly held corporations. It is presented from the perspective that before too long virtually all students will serve on one or more corporate boards of directors and that each should, therefore, know about the duties owed by directors and officers to those toward whom they bear a fiduciary duty. The course covers the basic obligations of corporate directors and managers under state corporate law and the federal securities laws. It also considers the rights and responsibilites of other major stake holders in the governance of public corporations, including shareholders, creditors/bondholders, employees (including corporate executives), investment bankers, corporate lawyers, and accountants. Particular attention is given to the law of mergers and acquisitions. Important issues of social policy concerning large business corporations are also discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "LAW OF CORP MGMT & FNCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29168/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.77", "rDifficulty": "2.79", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.93", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "LAW OF CORP MGMT & FNCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-202-001", "path": "/courses/29168/sections/001", "id": "29168-001", "aliases": ["LGST-202-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/29168/sections/001/reviews/706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN", "first_name": "NICHOLAS D", "last_name": "CONSTAN", "id": "706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN", "name": "NICHOLAS D CONSTAN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "29168-001-706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-202", "path": "/courses/29168", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29168/sections", "values": [{"name": "LAW OF CORP MGMT & FNCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-202-001", "path": "/courses/29168/sections/001", "id": "29168-001", "aliases": ["LGST-202-001"]}]}, "id": 29168, "aliases": ["LGST-202"]}
