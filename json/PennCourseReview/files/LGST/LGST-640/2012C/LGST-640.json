Leading firms are answering that question through a new business practice called gamification. They are using the techniques of digital game designers to serve objectives as varied as marketing, human resources management, innovation, health and wellness, education, and customer engagement. This course, the first of its kind, examines the mechanisms of gamification and provide an understanding of their effective use. \n\nThe course uses a project-based approach to explore gamification as a design practice, which is rooted in research on human motivation and implemented through online systems and social media. No particular technical skills or game knowledge is required. The course draws upon interdisciplinary source material as well as case studies to identify effective analytical models, strategies, techniques, and metrics for the application of game elements to real-world business context. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DIGITAL GAME DESIGN TECH: Digital Game Design Techniques for Business:Rules, Incentives, Applications", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29180/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.38", "rDifficulty": "1.54", "rStimulateInterest": "2.15", "rRecommendMajor": "1.77", "rCourseQuality": "1.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.38", "rCommAbility": "2.46", "rInstructorQuality": "2.37"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL GAME DESIGN TECH: Digital Game Design Techniques for Business:Rules, Incentives, Applications", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-640-401", "path": "/courses/29180/sections/401", "id": "29180-401", "aliases": ["LGST-640-401", "OPIM-640-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/29180/sections/401/reviews/2536-KEVIN-WERBACH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2536-KEVIN-WERBACH", "first_name": "KEVIN", "last_name": "WERBACH", "id": "2536-KEVIN-WERBACH", "name": "KEVIN WERBACH"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "29180-401-2536-KEVIN-WERBACH"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.90", "rDifficulty": "1.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL GAME DESIGN TECH: Digital Game Design Techniques for Business:Rules, Incentives, Applications", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "LGST-640-402", "path": "/courses/29180/sections/402", "id": "29180-402", "aliases": ["LGST-640-402", "OPIM-640-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/29180/sections/402/reviews/721-DAN-HUNTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/721-DAN-HUNTER", "first_name": "DAN", "last_name": "HUNTER", "id": "721-DAN-HUNTER", "name": "DAN HUNTER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "29180-402-721-DAN-HUNTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-640", "path": "/courses/29180", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29180/sections", "values": [{"name": "DIGITAL GAME DESIGN TECH: Digital Game Design Techniques for Business:Rules, Incentives, Applications", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-640-401", "path": "/courses/29180/sections/401", "id": "29180-401", "aliases": ["LGST-640-401", "OPIM-640-401"]}, {"name": "DIGITAL GAME DESIGN TECH: Digital Game Design Techniques for Business:Rules, Incentives, Applications", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "LGST-640-402", "path": "/courses/29180/sections/402", "id": "29180-402", "aliases": ["LGST-640-402", "OPIM-640-402"]}]}, "id": 29180, "aliases": ["LGST-640", "OPIM-640"]}
