This course develops managerial negotiation skills by mixing lectures and practice, using cases and exercises in which students negotiate with each other. The cases cover a wide range of problems and settings: one-shot deals between individuals, repeated negotiations, negotiations over several issues, negotiations among several parties (both within and between organizations), and cross-cultural issues. Performance in the cases accounts for nearly half the course grade. Students must also describe their experience and thoughts in a journal and write a term paper.\r\n\r\nOverall, this course was described as \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d and helpful. This course allowed students to practice negotiating in class and helped them explored different negotiation skills. Students said they were able to receive truly hand-on experience in \u201cunderstanding human emotions and manipulations.\u201d Many students enjoyed the atmosphere of this course. \r\n\r\nThe majority of students had nothing but high regards for Professor Kimbrough.

Some students also suggested that the grading policy potentially undermined the goal of this course and encouraged competition instead of cooperation.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/27960/sections/401/reviews/931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "first_name": "STEVEN O", "last_name": "KIMBROUGH", "id": "931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH", "name": "STEVEN O KIMBROUGH"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "27960-401-931-STEVEN-O-KIMBROUGH"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.10", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "OPIM-291-402", "path": "/courses/27960/sections/402", "id": "27960-402", "aliases": ["OPIM-291-402", "LGST-206-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/27960/sections/402/reviews/5505-JULIA-MINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5505-JULIA-MINSON", "first_name": "JULIA", "last_name": "MINSON", "id": "5505-JULIA-MINSON", "name": "JULIA MINSON"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "27960-402-5505-JULIA-MINSON"}]
