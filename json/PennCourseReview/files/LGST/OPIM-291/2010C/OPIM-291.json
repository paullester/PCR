{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/667"}, "description": "Negotiation is the art and the science of creating good agreements. This course develops managerial negotiation skills by mixing lectures and practice, using cases and exercises in which students negotiate with each other. The cases cover a wide range of problems and settings: one-shot deals between individuals, repeated negotiations, negotiations over several issues, negotiations among several parties (both within and between organizations), and cross-cultural issues. Performance in the cases accounts for nearly half the course grade. Students must also describe their experience and thoughts in a journal, and write a term paper. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23596/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.19", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "3.05", "rInstructorQuality": "2.58"}, "section": {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-291-401", "path": "/courses/23596/sections/401", "id": "23596-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-291-401", "MGMT-291-401", "LGST-206-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/23596/sections/401/reviews/5505-JULIA-MINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5505-JULIA-MINSON", "first_name": "JULIA", "last_name": "MINSON", "id": "5505-JULIA-MINSON", "name": "JULIA MINSON"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "23596-401-5505-JULIA-MINSON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "1.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.81", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "1.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "2.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.78", "rCommAbility": "3.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "OPIM-291-402", "path": "/courses/23596/sections/402", "id": "23596-402", "aliases": ["OPIM-291-402", "MGMT-291-402", "LGST-206-402"]}, "comments": "OPIM 291 develops managerial negotiation skills by mixing lectures and practice, using cases and exercises in which students negotiate with each other.
