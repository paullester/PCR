The central issues of this course deal with understanding the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations in conflict management situations. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiations as it is practiced in a variety of settings. The course is designed to be relevant to the broad spectrum of problems that are faced by the manager and professional, including management of multinationals, ethical issues, and alternative dispute resolutions.\r\n\r\nMost students found this to be a \u201cfantastic course.\u201d One student stated that they \u201clearned a lot that will help later in life.\u201d  One of student\u2019s favorite aspects of the course content was the focus on interesting case studies, but another does note that sometimes \u201cthe lectures and readings were not very helpful.\u201d Another student stated that the \u201cmaterial presented was not of great academic rigor\u201d and placed the most value on the case studies that were reviewed. \r\n \r\nProfessor Hershey was described as an \u201cexcellent professor.\u201d A student noted how Professor Hershey presented \u201chis experiences and the subject matter in a cohesive fashion that is enjoyable to be a part of.\u201d  One student even named Professor Hershey as \u201cthe best Wharton professor.\u201d  Professor Hershey is lauded for \u201cexceptional accessibility.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course is recommended for both majors and non-majors. The amount of weekly work was very manageable. Some students in past semesters expressed frustration over the grading distribution between exams and participation.  One student noted that since the class is largely determined by performance that is peer evaluated, there was an incentive for some to report poorly on other students to receive a better grade themselves.  Nevertheless, in the past semesters, most students seemed satisfied with the grading of the class.  \r\n\r\n*This review is based on 5 student comments\r\n", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/24934/sections/403/reviews/4698-JOHN-C--HERSHEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4698-JOHN-C--HERSHEY", "first_name": "JOHN C.", "last_name": "HERSHEY", "id": "4698-JOHN-C--HERSHEY", "name": "JOHN C.
