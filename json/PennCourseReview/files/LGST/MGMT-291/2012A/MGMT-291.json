Students felt there was a lack of feedback among the four short graded essays and therefore the grading was ambiguous and frustrating. There was no clear way to gauge one strategy\u2019s success over another and ultimately made \u201ceffective analysis impossible.\u201d Besides the grading controversy, the students felt the class taught them effective and important and practical life skills.\r\n\tOverall, students felt that Professor Mueller was not available to provide sufficient feedback on how they were doing in the course. While Professor Mueller was illustrated as a knowledgeable and interesting teacher, she was unable to mediate discussions and students were often cut-off mid sentence \u201cif their arguments were not in line with what the instructor had in mind.\u201d Many students hoped that Professor Mueller would teach and grade by \u201cobserving each of us negotiate.\u201d\r\n\tThis management class was for Wharton undergraduate students. The workload was described as \u201cvery light\u201d but the grading system was equally ambiguous. The prerequisites of the course are: MGMT 100 and MGMT 101.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/27752/sections/411/reviews/3067-JENNIFER-S--MUELLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3067-JENNIFER-S--MUELLER", "first_name": "JENNIFER S.", "last_name": "MUELLER", "id": "3067-JENNIFER-S--MUELLER", "name": "JENNIFER S.
