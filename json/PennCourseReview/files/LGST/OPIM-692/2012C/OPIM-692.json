In this course, we explore a wide range of negotiation topics from crisis and hostage negotiations, to the role of emotions including anxiety, envy and anger in negotiations, to backlash effects for women in negotiations, and the role of alcohol in negotiations. We will survey many aspects of current negotiation research, discuss historic negotiation cases, and students will participate in role-play exercise. Many of the role play exercises will involve multi-party negotiations and afford opportunities to hone skills in team-based negotiations. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "ADV TOPICS NEGOTIATION: Advanced Topics in Negotiations - Wharton Semester in San Francisco", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29476/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.83", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "1.77", "rRecommendMajor": "2.08", "rCourseQuality": "1.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "2.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.54", "rCommAbility": "2.08", "rInstructorQuality": "1.87"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TOPICS NEGOTIATION: Advanced Topics in Negotiations - Wharton Semester in San Francisco", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-692-401", "path": "/courses/29476/sections/401", "id": "29476-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-692-401", "MGMT-692-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/29476/sections/401/reviews/3587-MAURICE-E--SCHWEITZER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3587-MAURICE-E--SCHWEITZER", "first_name": "MAURICE E.", "last_name": "SCHWEITZER", "id": "3587-MAURICE-E--SCHWEITZER", "name": "MAURICE E.
