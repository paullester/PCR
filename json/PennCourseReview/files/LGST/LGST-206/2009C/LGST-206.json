Students found the material to be \u201cvery practical\u201d and \u201cuseful.\u201d Students appreciated how they were not graded on the outcome of their negotiation exercises because it made them more comfortable when trying out a new strategy.\r\n\r\nStudents also had many positive things to say about Professor Shropshire. In particular, students appreciated how he \u201cmakes you immediately feel comfortable with negotiations.\u201d One student described him as \u201cvery humble, great voice, and just seems to bring a lot of credibility to the table.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents did not find the course to be particularly difficult, but they learned a great deal.
