{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3148"}, "description": "This course explores the history, literature, and philosophy of two age-old questions: what does it mean to be successful and how does one achieve this elusive goal? It surveys some of the classics of the \"success\" genre - from Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography in the 18th century to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People and Marcus Buckingham's Now, Discover Your Strengths in the 20th and 21st centuries. Case studies of remarkable achievements in business and society and Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman provide additional contexts within which to reflect on the questions at the center of the course. Students will keep a personal journal and use web-based tools to examine their own character strengths, talents, and achievement orientations. Grading is based on class attendance and participation, reading response papers, personal journals on assigned topics involving self reflection, a mid-term paper on an assigned research subject related to success, and a final, longer paper exploring, based on course readings and original research, each students personal philosophy of success.

While the course content contains \u201ca lot of reading,\u201d outside material and personal experiences drawn from Professor Shell and the other students make it \u201cincredibly fascinating\u2026 as ideal of a college class as one can get.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents heaped almost every type of praise on Professor Shell, calling him \u201cterrific, incredible, excellent, amazing, and fabulous\u2026 by far my favorite professor at Penn.\u201d According to one student, Professor Shell creates \u201can amazingly welcoming and entertaining classroom experience\u201d with great organization and an ability to get the class to interact with each other. For those who like to get to know their professors on a more personal level, one student expressed an appreciation for Professor Shell\u2019s willingness \u201cto spend time outside the classroom and mentor students.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne area of criticism was the grading system. While Professor Shell warns students before the class to \u201clearn and not worry about the grade,\u201d many expressed frustration at what they felt were \u201csubjective\u201d grades that \u201cdon\u2019t really have anything to do with what you are learning.\u201d Students were divided on whether the top students were those who \u201cgot the most out of the class\u201d or were simply the best writers. A few also noted that the class requires \u201ca lot of reading and writing.\u201d", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/15994/sections/001/reviews/2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "first_name": "G RICHARD", "last_name": "SHELL", "id": "2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "name": "G RICHARD SHELL"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "15994-001-2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-227", "path": "/courses/15994", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15994/sections", "values": [{"name": "LITERATURE OF SUCCESS: Literature of Success: Ethical and Historical Perspectives", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-227-001", "path": "/courses/15994/sections/001", "id": "15994-001", "aliases": ["LGST-227-001"]}]}, "id": 15994, "aliases": ["LGST-227"]}
