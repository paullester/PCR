{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3148"}, "description": "This course explores the history, literature, and philosophy of two age-old questions: what does it mean to be successful and how does one achieve this elusive goal? It surveys some of the classics of the \"success\" genre - from Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography in the 18th century to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People and Marcus Buckingham's Now, Discover Your Strengths in the 20th and 21st centuries. Case studies of remarkable achievements in business and society and Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman provide additional contexts within which to reflect on the questions at the center of the course. Students will keep a personal journal and use web-based tools to examine their own character strengths, talents, and achievement orientations. Grading is based on class attendance and participation, reading response papers, personal journals on assigned topics involving self reflection, a mid-term paper on an assigned research subject related to success, and a final, longer paper exploring, based on course readings and original research, each students personal philosophy of success. No final exam. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "LITERATURE OF SUCCESS: Literature of Success: Ethical and Historical Perspectives", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21955/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.90", "rDifficulty": "2.66", "rStimulateInterest": "3.97", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.93", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "LITERATURE OF SUCCESS: Literature of Success: Ethical and Historical Perspectives", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-227-001", "path": "/courses/21955/sections/001", "id": "21955-001", "aliases": ["LGST-227-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/21955/sections/001/reviews/2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "first_name": "G RICHARD", "last_name": "SHELL", "id": "2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "name": "G RICHARD SHELL"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "21955-001-2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-227", "path": "/courses/21955", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21955/sections", "values": [{"name": "LITERATURE OF SUCCESS: Literature of Success: Ethical and Historical Perspectives", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-227-001", "path": "/courses/21955/sections/001", "id": "21955-001", "aliases": ["LGST-227-001"]}]}, "id": 21955, "aliases": ["LGST-227"]}
