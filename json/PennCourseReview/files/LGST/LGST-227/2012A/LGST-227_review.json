It surveys some of the classics of the \"success\" genre - from Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography in the 18th century to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People and Marcus Buckingham's Now, Discover Your Strengths in the 20th and 21st centuries. Case studies of remarkable achievements in business and society and Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman provide additional contexts within which to reflect on the questions at the center of the course. Students will keep a personal journal and use web-based tools to examine their own character strengths, talents, and achievement orientations. Grading is based on class attendance and participation, reading response papers, personal journals on assigned topics involving self reflection, a mid-term paper on an assigned research subject related to success, and a final, longer paper exploring, based on course readings and original research, each students personal philosophy of success. There is no final exam for this course.\r\n\r\nOverall, students found that this was a \u201cgreat class to take, regardless of school or major.\u201d Students found that the course \u201cis well structured and it is easy to understand what you are taking away each week.\u201d One student noted that it \u201cshould be required for every senior at Penn.\u201d Students observed that there was a lot of \u201csharing and discussing very personal and meaningful thoughts, feelings and stories with the rest of the class\u201d and that it was \u201chighly-discussion based.\u201d \r\n\r\nMost students found that Professor Shell is \u201can amazing teacher\u201d and his \u201cknowledge of content is extraordinary.\u201d One student noted that Professor Shell \u201cbalances the act of leading and promoting discussions well\u201d while he \u201curges you to explore what you want to get out of life and how you\u2019re going to get there.\u201d Students thought that Professor Shell had high expectations for his students, which they noted as a positive attribute. \r\n\r\n\tMany students found that this class was \u201cnot an easy A\u201d and that the class was \u201ccurved because it was simply a Wharton class.\u201d Some students found that they did not like the reading, but found that the \u201creading is critical\u201d to the course. Other students found that the \u201cparticipation represents a high portion of the grade,\u201d which they did not like. Another student suggested that the \u201cmanner in which the class is being graded should be reviewed.\u201d This course is sometimes listed as a Benjamin Franklin Seminar, and it has no prerequisites. It is open to all students in all schools. \r\n", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/27668/sections/001/reviews/2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "first_name": "G RICHARD", "last_name": "SHELL", "id": "2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL", "name": "G RICHARD SHELL"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "27668-001-2191-G-RICHARD-SHELL"}]
