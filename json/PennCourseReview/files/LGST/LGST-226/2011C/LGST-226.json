{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3147"}, "description": "Markets play a central role in the life of a capitalist democracy. But is this a good thing? Should we let markets decide who is rich and who is poor? Who makes decisions and who follows them? Whose ideas get heard and whose ideas do not? The goal of this class will be to examine the market from the perspective of various social values to see whether we should want a market system and, if so, what kind of market system we should want. Among the issues we will examine are the following. Does the market contribute to the common good? If so, how? Does the market conflict with the idea that all human beings are of equal value? What is the relation between the market and freedom? Does the market liberate us or oppress us? Can we reconcile the market with our democratic ideals? What role should corporations play in a healthy democracy? What role should markets play in an increasingly globalized world? We will read several important philosophers, economists and political theorists writing on these issues, including Adam Smith, John Rawls, Amartya Sen, Friedrich Hayek, Karl Marx, Robert Nozick, Jurgen Habermas, and others. Grades will be based on three papers and class participation. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "MARKETS,MORALITY&CAPITAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24648/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "MARKETS,MORALITY&CAPITAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-226-001", "path": "/courses/24648/sections/001", "id": "24648-001", "aliases": ["LGST-226-001"]}, "comments": "Legal Studies 226 analyzes the market system and its relations with the common good, idea of equal value, freedom, democracy and globalized world through perspective of various social values by studying works of several important philosophers, economists and political theorists including Adam Smith, John Rawls, Amartya Sen, Friedrich Hayek, Karl Marx, Robert Nozick, Ronald Dworkin, J?rgen Habermas, Peter Singer, and others. \r\n\r\nOverall, students considered this class to be thought provoking, as it offers a \u201ccomprehensive overview of political philosophy.\u201d The class readings were said to be interesting, as they made students \u201cthink about a wide range of different interactions between the market, policy, and the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students regarded Professor Hussain as very knowledgeable on the class topics, as he is \u201cwell-prepared and well-organized\u201d and \u201cpassionate about his subject.\u201d However, some of the students complained that Professor Hussain was too \u201cjudgmental\u201d and \u201cone-sided\u201d when he guided the class discussion. One student wrote that \u201cthe course seemed like a study of Professor Hussain\u2019s perspectives, rather than a rational, objective, and critical analysis of course material.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn general, many of the students commented that this course was interesting and extraordinary. Some found that there was too much reading, some of which were not particularly helpful to the in-class discussion. Students did not get their \u201cfirst grade in the course until after Add/Drop,\u201d and Professor Hussain was a hard grader. \r\n", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/24648/sections/001/reviews/2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN", "first_name": "WAHEED", "last_name": "HUSSAIN", "id": "2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN", "name": "WAHEED HUSSAIN"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "24648-001-2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-226", "path": "/courses/24648", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24648/sections", "values": [{"name": "MARKETS,MORALITY&CAPITAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-226-001", "path": "/courses/24648/sections/001", "id": "24648-001", "aliases": ["LGST-226-001"]}]}, "id": 24648, "aliases": ["LGST-226"]}
