One student wrote that \u201cthe course seemed like a study of Professor Hussain\u2019s perspectives, rather than a rational, objective, and critical analysis of course material.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn general, many of the students commented that this course was interesting and extraordinary. Some found that there was too much reading, some of which were not particularly helpful to the in-class discussion. Students did not get their \u201cfirst grade in the course until after Add/Drop,\u201d and Professor Hussain was a hard grader. \r\n", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/24648/sections/001/reviews/2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN", "first_name": "WAHEED", "last_name": "HUSSAIN", "id": "2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN", "name": "WAHEED HUSSAIN"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "24648-001-2538-WAHEED-HUSSAIN"}]
