Though it was a three hour, once-a-week course, students reported that they were \u201cnever once bored\u201d and several students even described it as \u201cone of the best classes\u201d that they have taken. The dialogue nature of the class helped them learn the material and \u201cunderstand the nuances between different topics.\u201d Though the workload and assigned reading for the class was heavy, students learned a great deal. \r\n\r\nProfessor Rongione was unanimously praised in reviews as a \u201clovable\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d professor, who \u201ccares very much for his students and the subject he teaches.\u201d Professor Rongione gave every student opportunities to speak, and kept them on their toes by cold calling and challenging statements, a method which was \u201cvery effective in getting everyone to participate and know each other.\u201d Students applauded his ability to stimulate student interest throughout the entire three-hour class period, while still covering all of the necessary material. Students described Professor Rongione as an \u201cA+\u201d and \u201cthe best professor at Penn.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis class was taken mainly by Wharton students. It fulfills part of the Societal Environment general requirement. Though the amount learned was great, some students questioned how much they actually improved their \u201cethical base.\u201d The work and reading was heavy for this class, but this was matched by the large amount of information the students learned throughout the semester. The class was very participation heavy, so students must be diligent about the assigned reading. Overall, students highly recommended this course. \r\n", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/24641/sections/003/reviews/714-NICHOLAS-M--RONGIONE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/714-NICHOLAS-M--RONGIONE", "first_name": "NICHOLAS M.", "last_name": "RONGIONE", "id": "714-NICHOLAS-M--RONGIONE", "name": "NICHOLAS M.
