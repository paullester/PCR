{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4739"}, "description": "This course aims to familiarize students with and prepare students for the conduct of international transactions. Students will work their way through a series of hypothetical trade transactions, placed against a background of concepts and general theories. Students will take a hypothetical firm through a series of possible transnational investments, again after discussion of concepts and general theories. Throughout, the course will discuss issues of importance to emerging economies. Students should be able to make thoughtful choices rather than simply reciting bullet points about international business transactions. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "INT'L BUS TRANSACTIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18891/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "2.05", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "1.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "INT'L BUS TRANSACTIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-214-401", "path": "/courses/18891/sections/401", "id": "18891-401", "aliases": ["LGST-214-401", "LGST-814-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/18891/sections/401/reviews/1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "first_name": "PHILIP M", "last_name": "NICHOLS", "id": "1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "name": "PHILIP M NICHOLS"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "18891-401-1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-214", "path": "/courses/18891", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18891/sections", "values": [{"name": "INT'L BUS TRANSACTIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LGST-214-401", "path": "/courses/18891/sections/401", "id": "18891-401", "aliases": ["LGST-214-401", "LGST-814-401"]}]}, "id": 18891, "aliases": ["LGST-214", "LGST-814"]}
