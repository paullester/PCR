{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/674"}, "description": "The course explores the fundamentals of U.S. constitutional doctrine and adjudication, with an emphasis on commercial and business issues and implications of constitutional law. The course starts by considering the Constitution and the structure and relationship of the governmental entities it establishes and upon which it depends. Special attention is given to the role of the federal courts, especially the Supreme Court, in interpreting and applying constitutional principles. From this foundation, the course moves on to examine in detail the major economic and business implications of constitutional law in different eras of the nation's history. A core theme is how historical events and changing notions of public policy have affected and been affected by the evolution of constitutional doctrine. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "CONST LAW & FREE ENTERPR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18893/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "2.37", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.79", "rCourseQuality": "3.68", "rWorkRequired": "2.32", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79", "rReadingsValue": "3.16", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.68", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.95"}, "section": {"name": "CONST LAW & FREE ENTERPR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-221-001", "path": "/courses/18893/sections/001", "id": "18893-001", "aliases": ["LGST-221-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/18893/sections/001/reviews/706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN", "first_name": "NICHOLAS D", "last_name": "CONSTAN", "id": "706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN", "name": "NICHOLAS D CONSTAN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "18893-001-706-NICHOLAS-D-CONSTAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-221", "path": "/courses/18893", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18893/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONST LAW & FREE ENTERPR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-221-001", "path": "/courses/18893/sections/001", "id": "18893-001", "aliases": ["LGST-221-001"]}]}, "id": 18893, "aliases": ["LGST-221"]}
