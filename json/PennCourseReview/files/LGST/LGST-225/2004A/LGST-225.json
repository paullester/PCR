{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2866"}, "description": "The course examines the distinctive moral problems professionals confront. We will compare and contrast the responsibilities of business leaders and advisors, lawyers, physicians, soldiers, police, and other professionals. We will examine conflicts of interest to find out what those conflicts reveal about professional responsibilities, and how they can be resolved. We will try to understand notions of loyalty, authority, honesty, and integrity as they function in professional life. We will explore the role of self-regulation in professional organizations, and consider the standards of conduct these organizations impose. Specific questions we may explore: What are the responsibilities of a financial advisor whose client cannot understand? What are the responsibilities of a criminal defense lawyer who belives that her client is guilty and will commit more crime? What are the responsibilities of a psychiatrist whose patient reveals in confidence that he is likely to engage in a dangerous act? Can an auditor maintain independence and objectivity when financial incentives suggest an audit that favors her client? \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ETHICS IN THE PROFESSION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6763/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.70", "rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.60", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "ETHICS IN THE PROFESSION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-225-001", "path": "/courses/6763/sections/001", "id": "6763-001", "aliases": ["LGST-225-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/6763/sections/001/reviews/1546-ALAN-STRUDLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1546-ALAN-STRUDLER", "first_name": "ALAN", "last_name": "STRUDLER", "id": "1546-ALAN-STRUDLER", "name": "ALAN STRUDLER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "6763-001-1546-ALAN-STRUDLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-225", "path": "/courses/6763", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6763/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHICS IN THE PROFESSION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-225-001", "path": "/courses/6763/sections/001", "id": "6763-001", "aliases": ["LGST-225-001"]}]}, "id": 6763, "aliases": ["LGST-225"]}
