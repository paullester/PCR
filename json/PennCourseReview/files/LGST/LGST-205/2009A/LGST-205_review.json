The first half considers relevant antitrust doctrine & policy: mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures; pricing strategy; marketing channel strategy; and limits on market dominance. The second half considers the intellectual property dimension as well as federal and state laws pertaining to trade secrets, unfair competition, and consumer protection. The focus is primarily on U.S. law, but the challenges posed by diverse domestic, foreign, and international regimes will also be emphasized. The course is useful to students contemplating employment in the field of marketing, and to students interested in anticipating legal constraints on competitive strategies. Most broadly, the course should be of interest to anyone desiring to understand the legal and public policy issues relating to the government regulation of business.\r\n\r\nStudents generally found the course \u201cenjoyable\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d and valued the assigned readings as useful.
