There are no prerequisites of this course. Some students complained that they were tested on concepts not covered in lecture. Students found it very helpful that every lecture was recorded. Relevant projects were required for this course.\r\n", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/28089/sections/401/reviews/4549-ROBERT-D--LANE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4549-ROBERT-D--LANE", "first_name": "ROBERT D.", "last_name": "LANE", "id": "4549-ROBERT-D--LANE", "name": "ROBERT D.
