One student noted that \u201cthe material itself is useful for everyday applications\u201d and is also practical for \u201cdeveloping a much needed ability to think through and solve problems.\u201d  The content involves weekly readings and class discussions, during which participation from every student is required. According to another former class member, the course provided \u201cfresh insights and perspectives on global issues.\u201d\r\n\r\nOpinions on Professor Nichols\u2019 teaching style varied. A majority found him to be \u201cbrilliant and thoroughly engaging\u201d and one student noted that he had an \u201cextraordinary ability to get students involved and actively interested in the material.\u201d  A second student described him as \u201cstrict\u201d but also as someone who \u201creally cares about what the students think.\u201d  Another student found his \u201cknowledge of law extensive and very thorough.\u201d  His common practice of engaging in cold calls was described by one as a \u201ctough, but fair\u201d teaching method that \u201ckeeps you on your toes,\u201d while ensuring students kept up with the readings.  Nevertheless, a few students do note that Professor Nichols\u2019 teaching style and choice of cold-calling \u201ccan be really harsh.\u201d A small group of students felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d  Many students met Professor Nichols\u2019 \u201ctough attitude and high expectations\u201d and found him to be \u201can amazing professor.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course is an excellent option for anyone interested in learning about the legal system, regardless of whether they are in a related major.  Exams were described by one student as \u201cquite difficult\u201d because it was hard to prepare for all of the \u201chypotheticals contained within them.\u201d  Although a decent amount of reading is required for this course, students do place a high value on the readings assigned and most learn a lot from them.  Because of Professor Nichols\u2019 practice of cold calling and high standard for classroom etiquette (arriving on time, not eating or drinking in class, etc.), this is a class that does require active engagement and thorough preparation each week. This course has no prerequisites.\r\n", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/24638/sections/001/reviews/1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "first_name": "PHILIP M", "last_name": "NICHOLS", "id": "1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "name": "PHILIP M NICHOLS"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "24638-001-1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.52", "rDifficulty": "3.23", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "3.03", "rInstructorAccess": "3.35", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.97", "rCommAbility": "3.26", "rInstructorQuality": "3.39"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO LAW & LEG PROC", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "LGST-101-002", "path": "/courses/24638/sections/002", "id": "24638-002", "aliases": ["LGST-101-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/24638/sections/002/reviews/1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "first_name": "PHILIP M", "last_name": "NICHOLS", "id": "1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS", "name": "PHILIP M NICHOLS"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "24638-002-1540-PHILIP-M-NICHOLS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.39", "rRecommendMajor": "3.49", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.62"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO LAW & LEG PROC", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "LGST-101-003", "path": "/courses/24638/sections/003", "id": "24638-003", "aliases": ["LGST-101-003"]}, "comments": "Legal Studies 101 presents law as an evolving social institution, with special emphasis on the legal regulation of business.

For the final project, students break up into teams to negotiate and draft an employment contract, which students described as \u201ca fantastic experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents praised Professor Marston for being interesting and knowledgeable, as well as encouraging. They reported that she not only cares about her students understanding and success in the class, but also that she was one of the few professors interested in \u201cher students' personal lives and extracurricular pursuits too.\u201d Her enthusiasm and energy during lectures was appreciated by students, and helped to bring dry topics to life. Her expertise on contracts made her an extremely knowledgeable source for this part of the course. Professor Marston cold-calls students during the second half of the semester, so it was important that students kept up with the material and prepared for these instances.\r\n\r\nMost students in this class were Wharton students, who took it to fill the societal environment general requirement. Students found the exams to be extremely challenging, but reported that, \u201cthey are not impossible if you really put in the time to understand the material.\u201d The class ended before finals period, which was helpful for students with a difficult finals course load. Overall, students enjoyed this course, despite the difficulty.
