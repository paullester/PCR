Is there any responsibility on the part of business to help meet those needs? In many cases, business can help to address important societal challenges profitably. Consider the success of for-profit microfinance institutions in providing credit to individuals who otherwise would not be served by regular banks. In other cases, it seems there are limits to the potential for business enterprises and business thinking to address societal needs. In these cases, if business enterprises are to help address societal needs, their form and mission may need to be modified. \r\n\r\nStudent feedback for this course was positive overall.
