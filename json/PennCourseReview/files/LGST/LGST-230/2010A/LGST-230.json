Is there any responsibility on the part of business to help meet those needs? What are models of successful business engagement in this area? How should success be measured? Are there limits to what businesses can and should do, and what institutional changes will enable businesses and entrepreneurs to better succeed? \n\nThis survey course provides students the opportunity to engage in the critical analysis of these and other questions that lie at the foundation of social impact and responsibility as an area of study. The course involves case studies, conceptual issues, and talks by practitioners. The course is designed to help students develop a framework to address the question: How should business enterprises and business thinking be engaged to improve society in areas not always associated with business? The course is required for the secondary concentration in Social Impact and Responsibility \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "SOCIAL IMPACT & RESP: Social Impact & Responsibility: Foundations", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26291/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.12", "rStimulateInterest": "3.74", "rRecommendMajor": "3.66", "rCourseQuality": "3.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.34", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIAL IMPACT & RESP: Social Impact & Responsibility: Foundations", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-230-001", "path": "/courses/26291/sections/001", "id": "26291-001", "aliases": ["LGST-230-001"]}, "comments": "LGST230 considers the following questions: What role can business play in helping to meet global societal needs, whether it involves protecting the environment, improving health, or eradicating poverty? Is there any responsibility on the part of business to help meet those needs? In many cases, business can help to address important societal challenges profitably. Consider the success of for-profit microfinance institutions in providing credit to individuals who otherwise would not be served by regular banks. In other cases, it seems there are limits to the potential for business enterprises and business thinking to address societal needs. In these cases, if business enterprises are to help address societal needs, their form and mission may need to be modified. \r\n\r\nStudent feedback for this course was positive overall. Many enjoyed the \u201cengaging discussions\u201d but some felt it was \u201ctoo heavily discussion based.\u201d Some wished that the class had been smaller given the emphasis on discussion.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hsieh was well-liked by his students.
