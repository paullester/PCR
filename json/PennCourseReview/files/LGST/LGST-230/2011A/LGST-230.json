{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4981"}, "description": "What role can business play in helping to meet global societal needs, whether it involves the environment, improving health, expanding eduction or eradicating poverty? Is there any responsibility on the part of business to help meet those needs? What are models of successful business engagement in this area? How should success be measured? Are there limits to what businesses can and should do, and what institutional changes will enable businesses and entrepreneurs to better succeed? \n\nThis survey course provides students the opportunity to engage in the critical analysis of these and other questions that lie at the foundation of social impact and responsibility as an area of study. The course involves case studies, conceptual issues, and talks by practitioners. The course is designed to help students develop a framework to address the question: How should business enterprises and business thinking be engaged to improve society in areas not always associated with business? The course is required for the secondary concentration in Social Impact and Responsibility \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SOCIAL IMPACT & RESP: Social Impact & Responsibility: Foundations", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21957/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.32", "rDifficulty": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "3.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.87", "rReadingsValue": "3.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.34", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIAL IMPACT & RESP: Social Impact & Responsibility: Foundations", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-230-001", "path": "/courses/21957/sections/001", "id": "21957-001", "aliases": ["LGST-230-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/21957/sections/001/reviews/716-NIEN-HE-HSIEH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/716-NIEN-HE-HSIEH", "first_name": "NIEN-HE", "last_name": "HSIEH", "id": "716-NIEN-HE-HSIEH", "name": "NIEN-HE HSIEH"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "21957-001-716-NIEN-HE-HSIEH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-230", "path": "/courses/21957", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21957/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOCIAL IMPACT & RESP: Social Impact & Responsibility: Foundations", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-230-001", "path": "/courses/21957/sections/001", "id": "21957-001", "aliases": ["LGST-230-001"]}]}, "id": 21957, "aliases": ["LGST-230"]}
