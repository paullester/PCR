{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/675"}, "description": "The Internet has become central to business and daily life. This course looks at how courts, legislatures, and regulators confront the major legal issues that the Internet poses. The fundamental challenge is that law comes from governments and other institutions in specific places, but the Internet is global and virtual. Conflicts such as the shutdown of the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing service and the debate over \"network neutrality\" regulations for broadband access illustrate the challenge. How does the legal system think about Google, Skype, Twitter, and Facebook? How should it? \n\nThe material in the course ranges from the foundations of cyberlaw, developed during the e-commerce boom of the 1990s, to current leading-edge questions around social networks, user-generated content, location-based services, cloud computing, and broadband platforms. Major topics include: how legally-enforceable contracts are made online; how courts determine jurisdiction over online transactions; intellectual property rules around digital assets such as music, video, and online texts; control over Internet domain names; liability of intermediaries such as Internet Service Providers and search engines; and online privacy protections. No pre-existing legal or legal or technical knowledge is required. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "LAW OF E-COMMERCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3168/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "1.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.54", "rCommAbility": "3.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "LAW OF E-COMMERCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-222-001", "path": "/courses/3168/sections/001", "id": "3168-001", "aliases": ["LGST-222-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/3168/sections/001/reviews/721-DAN-HUNTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/721-DAN-HUNTER", "first_name": "DAN", "last_name": "HUNTER", "id": "721-DAN-HUNTER", "name": "DAN HUNTER"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "3168-001-721-DAN-HUNTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-222", "path": "/courses/3168", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3168/sections", "values": [{"name": "LAW OF E-COMMERCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-222-001", "path": "/courses/3168/sections/001", "id": "3168-001", "aliases": ["LGST-222-001"]}]}, "id": 3168, "aliases": ["LGST-222"]}
