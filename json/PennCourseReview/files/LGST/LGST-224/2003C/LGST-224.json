{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/676"}, "description": "The 2000 UN Global Compact has confirmed the role of TNCs as central actors in the UN system of international human rights law, but whether their role should be voluntary or legally mandated remains in dispute. This course introduces students to how globalization has led to projects for expanding international human rights law to capture the operations of TNCs and why this development is opposed in many quarters. Competing perspectives on the pros and cons of imposing human rights responsibilities on TNCs and on the respective roles that businesses and governments should play will be examined. The Positions of various governments, businesses, international institutions, academics, and NGOs will be considered, and a number of illustrative case studies will be analyzed. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "HUMAN RTS&GLOBALIZATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4337/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.41", "rDifficulty": "2.59", "rStimulateInterest": "1.82", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.62", "rInstructorAccess": "2.15", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "2.35", "rInstructorQuality": "2.15"}, "section": {"name": "HUMAN RTS&GLOBALIZATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-224-001", "path": "/courses/4337/sections/001", "id": "4337-001", "aliases": ["LGST-224-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/4337/sections/001/reviews/719-ANN-E-MAYER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/719-ANN-E-MAYER", "first_name": "ANN E", "last_name": "MAYER", "id": "719-ANN-E-MAYER", "name": "ANN E MAYER"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "4337-001-719-ANN-E-MAYER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LGST-224", "path": "/courses/4337", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4337/sections", "values": [{"name": "HUMAN RTS&GLOBALIZATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "LGST-224-001", "path": "/courses/4337/sections/001", "id": "4337-001", "aliases": ["LGST-224-001"]}]}, "id": 4337, "aliases": ["LGST-224"]}
