This course exposes the student to many of the legal issues facing those in sport organizations.  Special attention is given to the regulation of professional and amateur athletics, agency law, antitrust law, the organizational structure of sports leagues and associations, labor-management relations, and Title IX. The development of effective communication skills will be emphasized through class presentations and written assignments, leadership and interpersonal communications will be developed through small group projects and meetings, and critical thinking and problem solving skills will be fostered through the careful study of numerous cases.\r\n\r\nStudents said the course was \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201cgreat for those who don\u2019t know much about major league sports.\u201d  Many found it extremely interesting, engaging, and unique.  Students liked that the concepts discussed in class were relevant to current events. One student named the course \u201cone of the most interesting classes\u201d offered at Penn.\r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Brandt very \u201cwilling to address any concerns.\u201d  Most called him an \u201coutstanding professor.\u201d  He does a good job \u201cstimulating student interest about the laws and policies relating to professional sports\u201d and he also has \u201creal experience in the sports industry.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe class required one large paper that made up the whole grade, rather than several short papers. The amount of reading \u201cwas large, with six reading assignments of approximately 100 pages per assignment,\u201d but another student mentioned that the readings were not required.  Many of the lectures were student led. The course \u201cdoes assume students know a good deal about the sports leagues prior to taking the class, but it\u2019s very possible to take it and enjoy it without this background.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/24649/sections/001/reviews/4401-ANDREW-D--BRANDT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4401-ANDREW-D--BRANDT", "first_name": "ANDREW D.", "last_name": "BRANDT", "id": "4401-ANDREW-D--BRANDT", "name": "ANDREW D.
