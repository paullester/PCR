Traditional finance and strategy courses do not consider the role of taxes. Similarly, traditional tax courses often ignore the richness of the decision context in which tax factors operate. The key themes of the framework - all parties, all taxes and all costs - are applied to decision contexts such as investments, compensation, organizational form, regulated industries, financial instruments, tax-sheltered investments, mergers and acquisitions, multinational, and multistate. The ultimate goal is to provide a new approach to thinking about taxes (and all forms of government intervention) that will be valuable even as laws and governments change. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "TAXES AND BUS STRATEGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26910/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "3.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "TAXES AND BUS STRATEGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ACCT-897-401", "path": "/courses/26910/sections/401", "id": "26910-401", "aliases": ["ACCT-897-401", "ACCT-297-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/26910/sections/401/reviews/4231-JENNIFER-L--BLOUIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4231-JENNIFER-L--BLOUIN", "first_name": "JENNIFER L.", "last_name": "BLOUIN", "id": "4231-JENNIFER-L--BLOUIN", "name": "JENNIFER L.
