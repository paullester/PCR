{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5"}, "description": "The first part of the course presents alternative methods of preparing managerial accounting information, and the remainder of the course examines how these methods are used by companies. Managerial accounting is a company's internal language, and is used for decision-making, production management, product design and pricing and for motivating and evaluating employees. Unless you understand managerial accounting, you cannot have a thorough understanding of a company's internal operations. What you learn in this course will help you understand the operations of your future employer (and enable you to be more successful at your job), and help you understand other companies you encounter in your role as competitor, consultant, or investor. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "LECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2478/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.21", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "1.70", "rRecommendMajor": "2.79", "rCourseQuality": "2.23", "rWorkRequired": "2.03", "rInstructorAccess": "2.43", "rReadingsValue": "1.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.59", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.34"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-102-001", "path": "/courses/2478/sections/001", "id": "2478-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-102-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 92, "path": "/courses/2478/sections/001/reviews/1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN", "first_name": "STANLEY", "last_name": "BAIMAN", "id": "1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN", "name": "STANLEY BAIMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 61, "id": "2478-001-1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.24", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "1.93", "rInstructorAccess": "2.76", "rReadingsValue": "1.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ACCT-102-002", "path": "/courses/2478/sections/002", "id": "2478-002", "aliases": ["ACCT-102-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 77, "path": "/courses/2478/sections/002/reviews/1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN", "first_name": "STANLEY", "last_name": "BAIMAN", "id": "1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN", "name": "STANLEY BAIMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "2478-002-1215-STANLEY-BAIMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "2.72", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.56", "rCommAbility": "3.28", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "208", "primary_alias": "ACCT-102-208", "path": "/courses/2478/sections/208", "id": "2478-208", "aliases": ["ACCT-102-208"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/2478/sections/208/reviews/1216-JONATHAN-ROGERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1216-JONATHAN-ROGERS", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "ROGERS", "id": "1216-JONATHAN-ROGERS", "name": "JONATHAN ROGERS"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "2478-208-1216-JONATHAN-ROGERS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ACCT-102", "path": "/courses/2478", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2478/sections", "values": [{"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-102-001", "path": "/courses/2478/sections/001", "id": "2478-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-102-001"]}, {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ACCT-102-002", "path": "/courses/2478/sections/002", "id": "2478-002", "aliases": ["ACCT-102-002"]}, {"name": "MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "208", "primary_alias": "ACCT-102-208", "path": "/courses/2478/sections/208", "id": "2478-208", "aliases": ["ACCT-102-208"]}]}, "id": 2478, "aliases": ["ACCT-102"]}
