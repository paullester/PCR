He was dubbed a \u201ccool guy\u201d and many appreciated that he kept classes short. He spent most of the class time explaining problems, which students felt was \u201ca very wise and pragmatic way to teach accounting.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were 6 quizzes that occurred every other week in order to \u201cmake sure you keep on top of the material.\u201d  The class grade \u201cis given directly from an average of the exams.\u201d In order to be exempt from the final, you must get an A on all 6 exams. Many felt the best way to learn in the class was to read the book before class to ask specific questions about problems.
