{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4499"}, "description": "This course will meet during Pre-Term. It is not a class for individuals who have had no prior exposure to financial accounting; rather it is a class for those students who have had some prior training in financial accounting but have not been able to place by credential into the half-semester financial accounting course, ACCT 612. Students who have placed into ACCT 612 by credential are also strongly advised to take this course, because the knowledge of all material covered in this course will be presumed in ACCT 612. ACCT 604 will review fundamentals of double-entry bookkeeping, basic terminology of statements, and recording of basic financial transactions. In addition, ACCT 604 will review revenue recognition concepts, preparation of the statement of cash flows, and the interpretation of financial statements. It is presumed that the student taking this course has previously studied most of this material. Upon completion of this course, the student should be prepared to take the Placement Exam. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16891/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.98", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "1.60", "rRecommendMajor": "2.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.19", "rInstructorAccess": "2.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.06", "rCommAbility": "2.04", "rInstructorQuality": "2.02"}, "section": {"name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-604-001", "path": "/courses/16891/sections/001", "id": "16891-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-604-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 93, "path": "/courses/16891/sections/001/reviews/2836-LUZI-HAIL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2836-LUZI-HAIL", "first_name": "LUZI", "last_name": "HAIL", "id": "2836-LUZI-HAIL", "name": "LUZI HAIL"}, "num_reviewers": 54, "id": "16891-001-2836-LUZI-HAIL"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.19", "rDifficulty": "2.62", "rStimulateInterest": "1.38", "rRecommendMajor": "2.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.04", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "2.39", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "2.05", "rInstructorQuality": "2.02"}, "section": {"name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ACCT-604-002", "path": "/courses/16891/sections/002", "id": "16891-002", "aliases": ["ACCT-604-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 90, "path": "/courses/16891/sections/002/reviews/2836-LUZI-HAIL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2836-LUZI-HAIL", "first_name": "LUZI", "last_name": "HAIL", "id": "2836-LUZI-HAIL", "name": "LUZI HAIL"}, "num_reviewers": 52, "id": "16891-002-2836-LUZI-HAIL"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.82", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "1.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.11", "rCourseQuality": "1.68", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.34", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.46", "rCommAbility": "1.79", "rInstructorQuality": "1.73"}, "section": {"name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "ACCT-604-003", "path": "/courses/16891/sections/003", "id": "16891-003", "aliases": ["ACCT-604-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 81, "path": "/courses/16891/sections/003/reviews/2836-LUZI-HAIL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2836-LUZI-HAIL", "first_name": "LUZI", "last_name": "HAIL", "id": "2836-LUZI-HAIL", "name": "LUZI HAIL"}, "num_reviewers": 45, "id": "16891-003-2836-LUZI-HAIL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ACCT-604", "path": "/courses/16891", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16891/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-604-001", "path": "/courses/16891/sections/001", "id": "16891-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-604-001"]}, {"name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ACCT-604-002", "path": "/courses/16891/sections/002", "id": "16891-002", "aliases": ["ACCT-604-002"]}, {"name": "ACCT REVIEW COURSE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "ACCT-604-003", "path": "/courses/16891/sections/003", "id": "16891-003", "aliases": ["ACCT-604-003"]}]}, "id": 16891, "aliases": ["ACCT-604"]}
