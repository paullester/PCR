{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4501"}, "description": "This class studies how complex financial structures account for their activities. Primary emphasis is on the application of purchase accounting for mergers and acquisitions, the equity method for investments, and preparing and interpreting consolidated financial statements. Other topics covered include translations and remeasurements for nondomestic investments, and earnings per share calculations for complex financial structures. Tax considerations and acquisition strategies are of only peripheral interest in this class, and students who are concerned primarily with those topics are advised to seek a different elective. \n\n", "semester": "2013C", "name": "ACCT FOR COMPLX FIN STRC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31160/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rTAQuality": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.13", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "2.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.40", "rCommAbility": "2.64", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "ACCT FOR COMPLX FIN STRC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ACCT-743-401", "path": "/courses/31160/sections/401", "id": "31160-401", "aliases": ["ACCT-743-401", "ACCT-243-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/31160/sections/401/reviews/6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA", "first_name": "RADHA", "last_name": "RADHAKRISHNA", "id": "6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA", "name": "RADHA RADHAKRISHNA"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "31160-401-6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.78", "rTAQuality": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "ACCT FOR COMPLX FIN STRC", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "ACCT-743-402", "path": "/courses/31160/sections/402", "id": "31160-402", "aliases": ["ACCT-743-402", "ACCT-243-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/31160/sections/402/reviews/6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA", "first_name": "RADHA", "last_name": "RADHAKRISHNA", "id": "6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA", "name": "RADHA RADHAKRISHNA"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "31160-402-6614-RADHA-RADHAKRISHNA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ACCT-743", "path": "/courses/31160", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31160/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACCT FOR COMPLX FIN STRC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ACCT-743-401", "path": "/courses/31160/sections/401", "id": "31160-401", "aliases": ["ACCT-743-401", "ACCT-243-401"]}, {"name": "ACCT FOR COMPLX FIN STRC", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "ACCT-743-402", "path": "/courses/31160/sections/402", "id": "31160-402", "aliases": ["ACCT-743-402", "ACCT-243-402"]}]}, "id": 31160, "aliases": ["ACCT-743", "ACCT-243"]}
