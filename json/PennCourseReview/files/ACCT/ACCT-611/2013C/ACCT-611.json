{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5496"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to provide an understanding of financial accounting fundamentals for prospective consumers of corporate financial information, such as managers, stockholders, financial analysts, and creditors. The course focuses on understanding how economic events like corporate investments, financing transactions and operating activities are recorded in the three main financial statements (i.e., the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows). Along the way, students will develop the technical skills needed to analyze corporate financial statements and disclosures for use in financial analysis, and to interpret how accounting standards and managerial incentives affect the financial reporting process. This course is recommended for students who want a more in-depth overview of the financial accounting required for understanding firm performance and potential future risks through analysis of reported financial information, such as students intending to go into security analysis and investment banking. \n\n", "semester": "2013C", "name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31156/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rTAQuality": "2.04", "rStimulateInterest": "2.19", "rRecommendMajor": "3.16", "rCourseQuality": "2.61", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.78", "rCommAbility": "2.65", "rInstructorQuality": "2.77"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-611-001", "path": "/courses/31156/sections/001", "id": "31156-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-611-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/31156/sections/001/reviews/4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER", "last_name": "ARMSTRONG", "id": "4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "name": "CHRISTOPHER ARMSTRONG"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "31156-001-4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rTAQuality": "2.35", "rStimulateInterest": "2.26", "rRecommendMajor": "2.93", "rCourseQuality": "2.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.12", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.79"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ACCT-611-002", "path": "/courses/31156/sections/002", "id": "31156-002", "aliases": ["ACCT-611-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/31156/sections/002/reviews/4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER", "last_name": "ARMSTRONG", "id": "4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "name": "CHRISTOPHER ARMSTRONG"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "31156-002-4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.77", "rDifficulty": "2.64", "rTAQuality": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.35", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "2.49", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.77", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "2.81"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "ACCT-611-003", "path": "/courses/31156/sections/003", "id": "31156-003", "aliases": ["ACCT-611-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 73, "path": "/courses/31156/sections/003/reviews/4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER", "last_name": "ARMSTRONG", "id": "4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG", "name": "CHRISTOPHER ARMSTRONG"}, "num_reviewers": 68, "id": "31156-003-4723-CHRISTOPHER-ARMSTRONG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ACCT-611", "path": "/courses/31156", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31156/sections", "values": [{"name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-611-001", "path": "/courses/31156/sections/001", "id": "31156-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-611-001"]}, {"name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ACCT-611-002", "path": "/courses/31156/sections/002", "id": "31156-002", "aliases": ["ACCT-611-002"]}, {"name": "FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "ACCT-611-003", "path": "/courses/31156/sections/003", "id": "31156-003", "aliases": ["ACCT-611-003"]}]}, "id": 31156, "aliases": ["ACCT-611"]}
