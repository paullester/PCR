{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4498"}, "description": "Upon completion of this course, the student should be prepared to take the full semester introductory Financial Accounting course, ACCT 611. ACCT 603 is designed for students who will be taking ACCT 611 and have no familiarity or experience in financial accounting. This course will meet during Pre-Term. Topics covered in this course include the double-entry accounting system, accounting for common transactions, and income statement and balance sheet preparation. While these topics will be briefly reviewed again in ACCT 611 from a financial statement user's perspective, ACCT 603 provides the technical details of accounting from a preparer's perspective. Students without any accounting background should take ACCT 603. Students with some accounting background who intend to take ACCT 611 should consider taking ACCT 603 as a refresher course. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "BASICS OF ACCOUNTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16890/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.28", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "3.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.02", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.98", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.84", "rInstructorQuality": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "BASICS OF ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-603-001", "path": "/courses/16890/sections/001", "id": "16890-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-603-001"]}, "comments": "Topics covered in ACCT 603 include the double-entry accounting system, accounting for common transactions, and income statement and balance sheet preparation.\r\n\r\nStudents commented that the class provided a \u201csolid foundation and comprehensive framework\u201d for financial accounting.
