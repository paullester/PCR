ACCT 603 is designed for students who will be taking ACCT 611 and have no familiarity or experience in financial accounting. This course will meet during Pre-Term. Topics covered in this course include the double-entry accounting system, accounting for common transactions, and income statement and balance sheet preparation. While these topics will be briefly reviewed again in ACCT 611 from a financial statement user's perspective, ACCT 603 provides the technical details of accounting from a preparer's perspective. Students without any accounting background should take ACCT 603. Students with some accounting background who intend to take ACCT 611 should consider taking ACCT 603 as a refresher course. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "FIN ACCT BASICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28473/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.37", "rWorkRequired": "1.26", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.37", "rCommAbility": "3.81", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "FIN ACCT BASICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-603-001", "path": "/courses/28473/sections/001", "id": "28473-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-603-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 183, "path": "/courses/28473/sections/001/reviews/4733-BRIAN-J--BUSHEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4733-BRIAN-J--BUSHEE", "first_name": "BRIAN J.", "last_name": "BUSHEE", "id": "4733-BRIAN-J--BUSHEE", "name": "BRIAN J.
