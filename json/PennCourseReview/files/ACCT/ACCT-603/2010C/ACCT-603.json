ACCT 603 is designed for students who will be taking ACCT 611 and have no familiarity or experience in financial accounting. This course will meet during Pre-Term. Topics covered in this course include the double-entry accounting system, accounting for common transactions, and income statement and balance sheet preparation. While these topics will be briefly reviewed again in ACCT 611 from a financial statement user's perspective, ACCT 603 provides the technical details of accounting from a preparer's perspective. Students without any accounting background should take ACCT 603. Students with some accounting background who intend to take ACCT 611 should consider taking ACCT 603 as a refresher course. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "BASICS OF ACCOUNTING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22576/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.19", "rCourseQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "2.89", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.48", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "BASICS OF ACCOUNTING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-603-001", "path": "/courses/22576/sections/001", "id": "22576-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-603-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 104, "path": "/courses/22576/sections/001/reviews/4733-BRIAN-J--BUSHEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4733-BRIAN-J--BUSHEE", "first_name": "BRIAN J.", "last_name": "BUSHEE", "id": "4733-BRIAN-J--BUSHEE", "name": "BRIAN J.
