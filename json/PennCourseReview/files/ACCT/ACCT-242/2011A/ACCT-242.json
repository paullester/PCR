{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2698"}, "description": "The primary objective of the course is to advance one's understanding of how financial reporting is used in a variety of decision making and contracting contexts (e.g., investment decisions or lending contracts). The course is designed to improve your ability to extract and interpret information in financial statements. It will also enhance your ability to use financial statements as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and valuation. \n\nThe course provides both a framework for and the tools necessary to analyze financial statements. At the conceptual level, it emphasizes that preparers and users of financial statements have different objectives and incentives. At the same time, the course is applied and stresses the use of actual financial statements. It draws heavily on real business problems and uses cases to illustrate the application of the techniques and tools. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "FIN.STM:ANAL&REP.INCENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21216/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "3.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.90", "rCommAbility": "2.90", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "FIN.STM:ANAL&REP.INCENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ACCT-242-001", "path": "/courses/21216/sections/001", "id": "21216-001", "aliases": ["ACCT-242-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/21216/sections/001/reviews/5275-STEPHANIE-A--SIKES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5275-STEPHANIE-A--SIKES", "first_name": "STEPHANIE A.", "last_name": "SIKES", "id": "5275-STEPHANIE-A--SIKES", "name": "STEPHANIE A.
