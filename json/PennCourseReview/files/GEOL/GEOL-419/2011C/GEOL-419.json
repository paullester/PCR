{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5220"}, "description": "This course examines the coasts of the world, how they have developed in the past, how they operate and are managed at present, and how they may in the future in the face of climate change. The challenge of coastal science is to develop the capability to predict changes that will occur in the next decade to century from external (e.g., earthquakes and tsunamis, hurricanes, sea-level rise) and internal (e.g. sediment dynamics) processes. In this course, students will acquire hands-on experience on some of the procedures employed to study the coastal system through practical fieldwork and applied laboratory research methodology. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "COASTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24480/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "1.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorQuality": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "1.33"}, "section": {"name": "COASTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GEOL-419-001", "path": "/courses/24480/sections/001", "id": "24480-001", "aliases": ["GEOL-419-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/24480/sections/001/reviews/2987-BENJAMIN-P--HORTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2987-BENJAMIN-P--HORTON", "first_name": "BENJAMIN P.", "last_name": "HORTON", "id": "2987-BENJAMIN-P--HORTON", "name": "BENJAMIN P.
