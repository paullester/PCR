{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4573"}, "description": "This course will introduce numerical techniques for analyzing data and formulating models in Earth Science. Students will first be introduced to Octave, a high level computer programming language (equivalent to Matlab, but free of cost) that allows data analysis and manipulation, sophisticated plotting and numerical modeling from the same interface. Data analysis will focus on time series, pattern recognition, image/topography analysis, and correlation statistics; modeling will include groundwater and surface water flow, random processes, diffusion, and erosion and deposition. This will be a seminar-style course where discussion will be encouraged, and additional topicsmay be covered depending on student interest. Through project-based learning exercises students will gain proficiency in Octave which will be useful for allaspects of Earth science. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ADV TOP EARTH SRFAC SCI: Modeling transport and pattern formation", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18743/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TOP EARTH SRFAC SCI: Modeling transport and pattern formation", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GEOL-542-301", "path": "/courses/18743/sections/301", "id": "18743-301", "aliases": ["GEOL-542-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/18743/sections/301/reviews/4354-DOUGLAS-J--JEROLMACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4354-DOUGLAS-J--JEROLMACK", "first_name": "DOUGLAS J.", "last_name": "JEROLMACK", "id": "4354-DOUGLAS-J--JEROLMACK", "name": "DOUGLAS J.
