{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3390"}, "description": "Understanding landscapes and the relationships between the natural world and society is fundamental to the natural sciences, architecture, medicine and public health, real estate and finance, urban studies and a range of other disciplines. The primary goal of this course is to expose students to the science of reading landscapes and disciplines that are founded in observation and hypothesis testing in the field. In addition, the course will orient incoming students to the physical environment in which they will be living while they are at Penn. \n\nThe course will be centered around lectures and discussions that are based on ten or more field trips that will take place on weekends and afternoons throughout the semester. The trips will be led by faculty members and will cover topics of plate tectonics, bedrock and surficial geology, geomorphology, hydrology, environmental geology, pollution and field ecology. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "Field Approaches to Understanding the Earth & Environmental Science", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23137/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "2.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "Field Approaches to Understanding the Earth & Environmental Science", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GEOL-096-301", "path": "/courses/23137/sections/301", "id": "23137-301", "aliases": ["GEOL-096-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/23137/sections/301/reviews/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "first_name": "FREDERICK N.", "last_name": "SCATENA", "id": "1839-FREDERICK-N--SCATENA", "name": "FREDERICK N.
