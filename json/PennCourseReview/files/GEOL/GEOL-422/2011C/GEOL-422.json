{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5221"}, "description": "This course is designed to give advanced undergraduate students and graduate students an understanding of the science behind numerical dating techniques in geological and archaeological contexts. This course will provide a background in the physics of radioactive decay and natural radiation sources. We will also cover various radiometric dating methods, and non-radiometric alternatives for younger samples. Numerous case studies involving questions of both geological and archaeological importance will be studied in this context. This class will cater to students interested applying chronologic tools to the areas of archeology, physical anthropology, soil science, tectonics, sea level change, climate change, land use change and ocean processes. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Rates and Dates: Applications and Methods of Modern Geochronology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24481/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "Rates and Dates: Applications and Methods of Modern Geochronology", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GEOL-422-401", "path": "/courses/24481/sections/401", "id": "24481-401", "aliases": ["GEOL-422-401", "GEOL-622-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/24481/sections/401/reviews/5374-JANE-KATHRYN-WILLENBRING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5374-JANE-KATHRYN-WILLENBRING", "first_name": "JANE KATHRYN", "last_name": "WILLENBRING", "id": "5374-JANE-KATHRYN-WILLENBRING", "name": "JANE KATHRYN WILLENBRING"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "24481-401-5374-JANE-KATHRYN-WILLENBRING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GEOL-422", "path": "/courses/24481", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24481/sections", "values": [{"name": "Rates and Dates: Applications and Methods of Modern Geochronology", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GEOL-422-401", "path": "/courses/24481/sections/401", "id": "24481-401", "aliases": ["GEOL-422-401", "GEOL-622-401"]}]}, "id": 24481, "aliases": ["GEOL-422", "GEOL-622"]}
