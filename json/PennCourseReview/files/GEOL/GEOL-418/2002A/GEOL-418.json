{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/530"}, "description": "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to theory and applications of chemistry in the earth and environmental sciences. Theory covered will include nucleosynthesis, atomic structure, acid-base equilibrium, thermodynamics, oxidation-reduction reactions. Applications will emphasize oceanography, atmospheric sciences and environmental chemistry, as well as other topics depending on the interests of the class. Although we will review the basics, this course is intended to supplement, rather than to replace, courses offered in the department of Chemistry. It is appropriate for advanced undergraduate as well as graduate students in Geology, Environmental Science, Chemistry and other sciences, who wish to have a better understanding of these important chemical processes \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "GEOCHEMISTRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/530/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GEOL-418", "path": "/courses/530", "sections": {"path": "/courses/530/sections", "values": [{"name": "GEOCHEMISTRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GEOL-418-001", "path": "/courses/530/sections/001", "id": "530-001", "aliases": ["GEOL-418-001"]}]}, "id": 530, "aliases": ["GEOL-418"]}
