{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4964"}, "description": "The development of surveying, imaging, and analytical techniques has facilitated many advances in the field of paleontology in recent years. This course will review the application of new and existing technologies to the analysis and interpretation of fossil remains. The research areas to be reviewed include: Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) applications to trackway and body mass estimates in dinosaurs; soft tissue preservation in the fossil record and the techniques to recognize and identify biomarkers; dinosaur locomotor reconstruction (using Gaitsym); geochemical and elemental analysis (particularly specializing in synchotron based techniques); application of high-performance computing; mechanical analysis of biomaterials (both extant and extinct); finite element analysis and the application of high resolution X-ray tomography. Given the fluid nature of developing applications, the course will include additional techniques which are a function of the research program evolving between the Universities of Manchester and Pennsylvania. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "APPLIED TECH IN PALEONTO: Applied Techniques in Paleontology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21787/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "0.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "APPLIED TECH IN PALEONTO: Applied Techniques in Paleontology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GEOL-527-301", "path": "/courses/21787/sections/301", "id": "21787-301", "aliases": ["GEOL-527-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/21787/sections/301/reviews/5375-PHILLIP-MANNING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5375-PHILLIP-MANNING", "first_name": "PHILLIP", "last_name": "MANNING", "id": "5375-PHILLIP-MANNING", "name": "PHILLIP MANNING"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "21787-301-5375-PHILLIP-MANNING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GEOL-527", "path": "/courses/21787", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21787/sections", "values": [{"name": "APPLIED TECH IN PALEONTO: Applied Techniques in Paleontology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GEOL-527-301", "path": "/courses/21787/sections/301", "id": "21787-301", "aliases": ["GEOL-527-301"]}]}, "id": 21787, "aliases": ["GEOL-527"]}
