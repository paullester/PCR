{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5119"}, "description": "The class will provide the basic physical, mathematical and technical knowledge to critically understand climatic and meteorologic problems and processes at different spatial scales. Students will become familiar with terms like convective cells, thermal winds, radiative balance, global atmospheric circulation, etc. In facing these different topics, general equations for geophysics fluid dynamic will be explained in the appropriate way and the common instruments used in meteorology will be presented. Students will learn to read a meteorologic map (surface and upper level geopotential height maps) and to understand the experimental and numerical investigations related to the synoptic meteorology. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "METEOROLOGY AND ATM SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23143/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "1.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.89", "rReadingsValue": "2.89", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "METEOROLOGY AND ATM SCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GEOL-403-001", "path": "/courses/23143/sections/001", "id": "23143-001", "aliases": ["GEOL-403-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/23143/sections/001/reviews/5619-FEDERICO-FALCINI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5619-FEDERICO-FALCINI", "first_name": "FEDERICO", "last_name": "FALCINI", "id": "5619-FEDERICO-FALCINI", "name": "FEDERICO FALCINI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "23143-001-5619-FEDERICO-FALCINI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GEOL-403", "path": "/courses/23143", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23143/sections", "values": [{"name": "METEOROLOGY AND ATM SCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GEOL-403-001", "path": "/courses/23143/sections/001", "id": "23143-001", "aliases": ["GEOL-403-001"]}]}, "id": 23143, "aliases": ["GEOL-403"]}
