{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4963"}, "description": "This course will survey the way geology controls the formation and location of energy resources. Questions we'll address include, \"How are oil and gas fields formed?\", \"Why does the Middle East have so much oil?\", \"What are the best locations in the US for wind and solar energy generation, and why?\". We will discuss hydrocarbon, nuclear, solar, wind, and tidal energy sources. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "GEOL AND GEOG OF ENERGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30383/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.40", "rTAQuality": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36", "rCommAbility": "3.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "GEOL AND GEOG OF ENERGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GEOL-508-301", "path": "/courses/30383/sections/301", "id": "30383-301", "aliases": ["GEOL-508-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/30383/sections/301/reviews/1857-STEPHEN-P--PHIPPS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1857-STEPHEN-P--PHIPPS", "first_name": "STEPHEN P.", "last_name": "PHIPPS", "id": "1857-STEPHEN-P--PHIPPS", "name": "STEPHEN P.
