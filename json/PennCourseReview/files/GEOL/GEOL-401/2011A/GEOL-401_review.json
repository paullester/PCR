The ultimate goal of such study is to make better land use decisions. Following a review of some basic geologic concepts, we study hazardous geologic processes including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, river flooding, coastal flooding and erosion, landslides, and subsidence. Next, we discuss environmental impacts associated with the use of fossil fuels, water, and soils. The course concludes with student presentations of selected topics in environmental geology.\r\n\r\nStudents felt the course was very good in terms of \u201ccovering a broad range of topics.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents heaped praise upon Professor Willig, citing her \u201cpassion for the subject,\u201d and \u201cunbridled, contagious enthusiasm.\u201d Furthermore, students could tell Professor Willig \u201creally cared about her students\u2019 ability to comprehend material and enjoy the topics.\u201d\r\n\r\nClass time included a combination of lecturing by the Professor and student presentations, as well as field trips.\r\n\r\n*8 respondents\r\n", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/21781/sections/001/reviews/572-SARAH-A--WILLIG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/572-SARAH-A--WILLIG", "first_name": "SARAH A.", "last_name": "WILLIG", "id": "572-SARAH-A--WILLIG", "name": "SARAH A.
