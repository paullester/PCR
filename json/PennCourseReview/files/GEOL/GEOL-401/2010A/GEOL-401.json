{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/529"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to better understand the interactions of humans and the environment through an examination of geologic processes and features as they influence, and are influenced, by human activities. the ultimate goal of such study is to make better land use decisions. Following a review of some basic geologic concepts, we will study hazardous geologic processes including; volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, river flooding,coastal flooding and erosion, landslides, and subsidence. Next, we will discuss environmental impacts associated with the use of fossil fuels, water, and soils. The course will conclude with student presentations of selected topics in environmental geology. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26120/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "1.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.39", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.72"}, "section": {"name": "ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GEOL-401-001", "path": "/courses/26120/sections/001", "id": "26120-001", "aliases": ["GEOL-401-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/26120/sections/001/reviews/572-SARAH-A--WILLIG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/572-SARAH-A--WILLIG", "first_name": "SARAH A.", "last_name": "WILLIG", "id": "572-SARAH-A--WILLIG", "name": "SARAH A.
