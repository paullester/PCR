{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4265"}, "description": "Patterns on the Earth's surface arise due to the transport of sediment by water and wind, with energy that is supplied by climate and tectonic deformation of the solid Earth. This course presents a treatment of the processes of erosion and deposition that shape landscapes. Emphasis will be placed on using simple physical principles as a tool for (a) understanding landscape patterns including drainage networks, river channels and deltas, desert dunes, and submarine channels, (b) reconstructing past environmental conditions using the sedimentary record, and (c) the management of rivers and landscapes under present and future climate scenarios. The course will conclude with a critical assessment of landscape evolution on other planets, including Mars. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15825/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GEOL-305-001", "path": "/courses/15825/sections/001", "id": "15825-001", "aliases": ["GEOL-305-001", "GEOL-545-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/15825/sections/001/reviews/4354-DOUGLAS-J--JEROLMACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4354-DOUGLAS-J--JEROLMACK", "first_name": "DOUGLAS J.", "last_name": "JEROLMACK", "id": "4354-DOUGLAS-J--JEROLMACK", "name": "DOUGLAS J.
