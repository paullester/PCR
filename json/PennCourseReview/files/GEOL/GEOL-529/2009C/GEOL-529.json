{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4572"}, "description": "The course deals with the application of thermodynamics and kinetics to understanding the chemistry of these parts of the Earth System. It begins with the relationship between the composition of the atmosphere and rainwater, and with the chemistry of weathering in open and closed systems. The course then examines the composition of rivers and lakes, including the influence of anthropogenic effects. This is followed by an analysis of physical chemistry of seawater, the controls on its composition, and its geologic evolution. The final section of the course examines the evolution of the redoz state of the atmopshere. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "GEOCHEM OF ATM AND OCEAN: Geochemistry of the Atmosphere and Oceans", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17435/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "GEOCHEM OF ATM AND OCEAN: Geochemistry of the Atmosphere and Oceans", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "GEOL-529-401", "path": "/courses/17435/sections/401", "id": "17435-401", "aliases": ["GEOL-529-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/17435/sections/401/reviews/4826-HEINRICH-D--HOLLAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4826-HEINRICH-D--HOLLAND", "first_name": "HEINRICH D.", "last_name": "HOLLAND", "id": "4826-HEINRICH-D--HOLLAND", "name": "HEINRICH D.
