{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5335"}, "description": "This course surveys the interdisciplinary field of Science and Literature Studies, with an emphasis on the modern life and physical sciences (19th century to the present). During the first part of the semester, we will examine literary responses to science: the \"two cultures\" debate; the impact of scientific and technical changes on literary practices; representations of science in fiction. In the second half of the course, we will consider science as literature: scientific rhetoric and standards of authorship; inscription or writing technolgies in laboratories; scientists as authors of popular literature; the impact of futurism and speculative fiction on science. Course readings will be drawn from fiction, the life and physical sciences, literary theory, and the history of science. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "WRITING SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26232/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "WRITING SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-323-401", "path": "/courses/26232/sections/401", "id": "26232-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-323-401", "ENGL-275-401", "STSC-323-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/26232/sections/401/reviews/4159-MARA-C-MILLS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4159-MARA-C-MILLS", "first_name": "MARA C", "last_name": "MILLS", "id": "4159-MARA-C-MILLS", "name": "MARA C MILLS"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "26232-401-4159-MARA-C-MILLS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HSOC-323", "path": "/courses/26232", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26232/sections", "values": [{"name": "WRITING SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HSOC-323-401", "path": "/courses/26232/sections/401", "id": "26232-401", "aliases": ["HSOC-323-401", "ENGL-275-401", "STSC-323-401"]}]}, "id": 26232, "aliases": ["HSOC-323", "ENGL-275", "STSC-323"]}
