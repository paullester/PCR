{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2521"}, "description": "Early drama in English had its roots as much in Christianity as in Classical antiquity. What grew into the theater of Shakespeare began as networks of strolling players and church atuhorities in market towns sponsoring cycles of \"miracle\" and \"mystery\" plays. This course will introduce students to major dramatic works of the medieval and early modern periods, including plays written for the public stage, closet dramas, masques, mayoral pageants and other kinds of performances. The course will also pay attention to the development of different dramatic genres during these periods, as well as the social and cultural contexts in which they were produced. Students thus will explore the history of drama in English through the renaissance to the closing of the theaters in 1641 and their eventual reopening in 1660. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "DRAMA TO 1660", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5206/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.80", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "DRAMA TO 1660", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-026-001", "path": "/courses/5206/sections/001", "id": "5206-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-026-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/5206/sections/001/reviews/2111-MARISSA-GREENBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2111-MARISSA-GREENBERG", "first_name": "MARISSA", "last_name": "GREENBERG", "id": "2111-MARISSA-GREENBERG", "name": "MARISSA GREENBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "5206-001-2111-MARISSA-GREENBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-026", "path": "/courses/5206", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5206/sections", "values": [{"name": "DRAMA TO 1660", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-026-001", "path": "/courses/5206/sections/001", "id": "5206-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-026-001"]}]}, "id": 5206, "aliases": ["ENGL-026"]}
