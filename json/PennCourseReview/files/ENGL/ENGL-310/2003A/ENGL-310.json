{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/428"}, "description": "This course will explore the slippage between the authority of an author over the reading process and other, more direct ways of exercising authority. We will investigate the extent to which modernist writers may have tried to engender a different model of reading, one that might have helped ordinary people resist Nazi authority. This \"new\" model of reading gives the reader much more responsibility in the reading process, and it insists that the reader be a more careful, flexible, and knowledgeable interpreter. Readings will include James Joyce, Virginia Woolfe, poems by T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and selected works by Samuel Beckett. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "TOPICS IN MODERNISM: Literary Authority and the Holocaust", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1583/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.07", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.93", "rReadingsValue": "3.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.93", "rCommAbility": "3.93", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN MODERNISM: Literary Authority and the Holocaust", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-310-301", "path": "/courses/1583/sections/301", "id": "1583-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-310-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/1583/sections/301/reviews/449-VICKI-L-MAHAFFEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/449-VICKI-L-MAHAFFEY", "first_name": "VICKI L", "last_name": "MAHAFFEY", "id": "449-VICKI-L-MAHAFFEY", "name": "VICKI L MAHAFFEY"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "1583-301-449-VICKI-L-MAHAFFEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-310", "path": "/courses/1583", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1583/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN MODERNISM: Literary Authority and the Holocaust", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-310-301", "path": "/courses/1583/sections/301", "id": "1583-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-310-301"]}]}, "id": 1583, "aliases": ["ENGL-310"]}
