Words like \u201cincredible\u201d, amazing,\u201d and \u201cfantastic\u201d were used to describe the course. More than one student even called it their favorite course at Penn. \u201cIf you are tired of reading boring books for literature classes but still find yourself in need of one or wanting one, then this is the course for you,\u201d said one student. While the course has a significant amount of reading and a weekly response paper, most students felt that the work was well worth the effort.&#8232;&#8232;\r\nProfessor Adams, like the course, received very positive reviews. Students described his teaching as \u201cfocused, in context, and appropriate\u201d to the assigned reading, and said that he was \u201centertaining,\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable.\u201d\r\nSome students felt over-whelmed by the amount of material, both assigned and in lectures, and some students mentioned they could have benefited from more information on Blackboard. The course consists of a good deal of work, requiring two books to read per week and a response paper. In addition, there was both a midterm and a final, which some students complained was too much work to do in a short period of time. While some thought the grading was fair, others believed it was too subjective and focused too much on details.", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/16514/sections/401/reviews/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "first_name": "MARK B", "last_name": "ADAMS", "id": "663-MARK-B-ADAMS", "name": "MARK B ADAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 37, "id": "16514-401-663-MARK-B-ADAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-110", "path": "/courses/16514", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16514/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCIENCE & LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "STSC-110-401", "path": "/courses/16514/sections/401", "id": "16514-401", "aliases": ["STSC-110-401", "ENGL-075-401", "HSOC-110-401", "HIST-117-401"]}]}, "id": 16514, "aliases": ["STSC-110", "ENGL-075", "HSOC-110", "HIST-117"]}
