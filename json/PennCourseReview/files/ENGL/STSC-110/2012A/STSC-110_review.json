Students will discuss such characteristic themes as utopias, the exploration of space and time, biological engineering, superman, robots, aliens, and other worlds--and the differences between European and American treatment of these themes.\r\n\tThe course was noted for the amount of reading, which made one student feel as though his course load was \u201c6 instead of 5.\u201d Another student described it simply as an \u201cexcellent course,\u201d while many others noted the high level of reading required.
