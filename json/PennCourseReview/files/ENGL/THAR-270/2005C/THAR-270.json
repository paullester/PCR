Connections to be considered include: The Group Theatre and Clifford Odets; The Actors Studio and Tennessee Williams; The Meisner Technique and David Mamet. We will also view the work of individual actors in filmed and live versions of the plays we study, examining the many ways in which actors collaborate with playwrights by creating roles and reinterpreting them. Readings will include the acting texts of American master teachers such as Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, and Uta Hagen, as well as a number of American plays. This course will include acting exercises and scene work. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "ACTING AMERICAN DRAMA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12497/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-270", "path": "/courses/12497", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12497/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACTING AMERICAN DRAMA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-270-401", "path": "/courses/12497/sections/401", "id": "12497-401", "aliases": ["THAR-270-401", "ENGL-256-401"]}]}, "id": 12497, "aliases": ["THAR-270", "ENGL-256"]}
