{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "Public Performance Art in the Global Age", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31088/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "Public Performance Art in the Global Age", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-301", "path": "/courses/31088/sections/301", "id": "31088-301", "aliases": ["THAR-275-301", "FNAR-060-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/31088/sections/301/reviews/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "first_name": "JAMES F.", "last_name": "SCHLATTER", "id": "1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "name": "JAMES F.
