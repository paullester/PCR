{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: THE EDINBURGH PROJECT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7210/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.80", "rDifficulty": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.40", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: THE EDINBURGH PROJECT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-301", "path": "/courses/7210/sections/301", "id": "7210-301", "aliases": ["THAR-275-301", "CLST-176-301", "ENGL-271-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/7210/sections/301/reviews/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "first_name": "ROSEMARY", "last_name": "MALAGUE", "id": "1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "name": "ROSEMARY MALAGUE"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "7210-301-1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.92", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Williams, Albee, Shepard", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/7210/sections/601", "id": "7210-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "CLST-176-601", "ENGL-271-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/7210/sections/601/reviews/1190-DAVID-FOX", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1190-DAVID-FOX", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "FOX", "id": "1190-DAVID-FOX", "name": "DAVID FOX"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "7210-601-1190-DAVID-FOX"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/7210", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7210/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: THE EDINBURGH PROJECT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-301", "path": "/courses/7210/sections/301", "id": "7210-301", "aliases": ["THAR-275-301", "CLST-176-301", "ENGL-271-301"]}, {"name": "CLASSICAL GREEK THEATRE: Classical Greek Theatre", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/7210/sections/401", "id": "7210-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "CLST-176-401", "ENGL-271-401"]}, {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Williams, Albee, Shepard", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/7210/sections/601", "id": "7210-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "CLST-176-601", "ENGL-271-601"]}]}, "id": 7210, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "CLST-176", "ENGL-271"]}
