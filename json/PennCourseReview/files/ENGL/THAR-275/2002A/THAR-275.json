{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1126/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-301", "path": "/courses/1126/sections/301", "id": "1126-301", "aliases": ["THAR-275-301", "ENGL-271-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/1126/sections/301/reviews/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "first_name": "MARCIA", "last_name": "FERGUSON", "id": "1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "name": "MARCIA FERGUSON"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "1126-301-1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/1126", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1126/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-301", "path": "/courses/1126/sections/301", "id": "1126-301", "aliases": ["THAR-275-301", "ENGL-271-301"]}, {"name": "CONT AMERICAN THEATRE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/1126/sections/601", "id": "1126-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "ENGL-271-601"]}]}, "id": 1126, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ENGL-271"]}
