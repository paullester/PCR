{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Connecting: From Stage to Screen to Monitors - and Back Again", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26843/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.87", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Connecting: From Stage to Screen to Monitors - and Back Again", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/26843/sections/401", "id": "26843-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "CINE-225-401", "ENGL-256-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/26843/sections/401/reviews/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "first_name": "MARCIA", "last_name": "FERGUSON", "id": "1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "name": "MARCIA FERGUSON"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "26843-401-1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.87", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Connecting: From Stage to Screen to Monitors - and Back Again", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/26843/sections/401", "id": "26843-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "CINE-225-401", "ENGL-256-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/26843/sections/401/reviews/2124-TIMOTHY-CORRIGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2124-TIMOTHY-CORRIGAN", "first_name": "TIMOTHY", "last_name": "CORRIGAN", "id": "2124-TIMOTHY-CORRIGAN", "name": "TIMOTHY CORRIGAN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "26843-401-2124-TIMOTHY-CORRIGAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Documentary Drama (The Edinburgh Project)", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/26843/sections/402", "id": "26843-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "CINE-225-402", "ENGL-256-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/26843/sections/402/reviews/416-CARY-M-MAZER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/416-CARY-M-MAZER", "first_name": "CARY M", "last_name": "MAZER", "id": "416-CARY-M-MAZER", "name": "CARY M MAZER"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "26843-402-416-CARY-M-MAZER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/26843", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26843/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Connecting: From Stage to Screen to Monitors - and Back Again", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/26843/sections/401", "id": "26843-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "CINE-225-401", "ENGL-256-401"]}, {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Documentary Drama (The Edinburgh Project)", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/26843/sections/402", "id": "26843-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "CINE-225-402", "ENGL-256-402"]}]}, "id": 26843, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "CINE-225", "ENGL-256"]}
