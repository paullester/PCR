{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "AMERICAN MUSICAL THEATRE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4799/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.41", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "AMERICAN MUSICAL THEATRE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/4799/sections/601", "id": "4799-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/4799/sections/601/reviews/1190-DAVID-FOX", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1190-DAVID-FOX", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "FOX", "id": "1190-DAVID-FOX", "name": "DAVID FOX"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "4799-601-1190-DAVID-FOX"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/4799", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4799/sections", "values": [{"name": "AMERICAN MUSICAL THEATRE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/4799/sections/601", "id": "4799-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601"]}]}, "id": 4799, "aliases": ["THAR-275"]}
