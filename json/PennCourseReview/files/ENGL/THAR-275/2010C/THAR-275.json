{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Theatrical Science/Scientific Theatre", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23869/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.75", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Theatrical Science/Scientific Theatre", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/23869/sections/401", "id": "23869-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "ENGL-256-401", "AFRC-275-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/23869/sections/401/reviews/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "first_name": "MARCIA", "last_name": "FERGUSON", "id": "1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "name": "MARCIA FERGUSON"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "23869-401-1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: African American Theatre: Pre-Emancipation to the Hip-Hop Generation", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/23869/sections/402", "id": "23869-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "ENGL-256-402", "AFRC-275-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/23869/sections/402/reviews/5091-KIM-Y-EUELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5091-KIM-Y-EUELL", "first_name": "KIM Y", "last_name": "EUELL", "id": "5091-KIM-Y-EUELL", "name": "KIM Y EUELL"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "23869-402-5091-KIM-Y-EUELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/23869", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23869/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Theatrical Science/Scientific Theatre", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/23869/sections/401", "id": "23869-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "ENGL-256-401", "AFRC-275-401"]}, {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: African American Theatre: Pre-Emancipation to the Hip-Hop Generation", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/23869/sections/402", "id": "23869-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "ENGL-256-402", "AFRC-275-402"]}]}, "id": 23869, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ENGL-256", "AFRC-275"]}
