{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Theatre that questions gender, sexual identity and sexuality.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12498/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Theatre that questions gender, sexual identity and sexuality.", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/12498/sections/601", "id": "12498-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "ENGL-256-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/12498/sections/601/reviews/1190-DAVID-FOX", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1190-DAVID-FOX", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "FOX", "id": "1190-DAVID-FOX", "name": "DAVID FOX"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "12498-601-1190-DAVID-FOX"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/12498", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12498/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Theatre that questions gender, sexual identity and sexuality.", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/12498/sections/601", "id": "12498-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "ENGL-256-601"]}]}, "id": 12498, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ENGL-256"]}
