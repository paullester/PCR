{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SEEDS OF MODERN DRAMA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28223/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.22", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.78", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "SEEDS OF MODERN DRAMA", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/28223/sections/402", "id": "28223-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "ENGL-256-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/28223/sections/402/reviews/416-CARY-M-MAZER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/416-CARY-M-MAZER", "first_name": "CARY M", "last_name": "MAZER", "id": "416-CARY-M-MAZER", "name": "CARY M MAZER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "28223-402-416-CARY-M-MAZER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/28223", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28223/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEEDS OF MODERN DRAMA", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/28223/sections/402", "id": "28223-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "ENGL-256-402"]}]}, "id": 28223, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ENGL-256"]}
