{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Contemporary American Drama, Theatre, and Cultural Performance", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9608/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.36", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.64", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.07", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "2.93", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Icons in Performance, Garbo to Madonna", "sectionnum": "602", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-602", "path": "/courses/9608/sections/602", "id": "9608-602", "aliases": ["THAR-275-602", "ENGL-274-602", "CINE-225-602"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/9608/sections/602/reviews/1190-DAVID-FOX", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1190-DAVID-FOX", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "FOX", "id": "1190-DAVID-FOX", "name": "DAVID FOX"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "9608-602-1190-DAVID-FOX"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/9608", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9608/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Contemporary American Drama, Theatre, and Cultural Performance", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/9608/sections/601", "id": "9608-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "ENGL-274-601", "CINE-225-601"]}, {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Icons in Performance, Garbo to Madonna", "sectionnum": "602", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-602", "path": "/courses/9608/sections/602", "id": "9608-602", "aliases": ["THAR-275-602", "ENGL-274-602", "CINE-225-602"]}]}, "id": 9608, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ENGL-274", "CINE-225"]}
