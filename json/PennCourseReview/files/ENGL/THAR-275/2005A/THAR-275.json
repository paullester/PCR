{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: East Meets West on Stage and Screen", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11055/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: East Meets West on Stage and Screen", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/11055/sections/401", "id": "11055-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "ASAM-275-401", "FILM-225-401", "COML-267-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/11055/sections/401/reviews/403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY", "first_name": "THERESE M", "last_name": "LAFFERTY", "id": "403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY", "name": "THERESE M LAFFERTY"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "11055-401-403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/11055", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11055/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: East Meets West on Stage and Screen", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/11055/sections/401", "id": "11055-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "ASAM-275-401", "FILM-225-401", "COML-267-401"]}]}, "id": 11055, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ASAM-275", "FILM-225", "COML-267"]}
