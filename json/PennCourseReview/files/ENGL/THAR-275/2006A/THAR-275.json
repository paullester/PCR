For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "THE EDINBURGH PROJECT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8425/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/8425", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8425/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE EDINBURGH PROJECT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-301", "path": "/courses/8425/sections/301", "id": "8425-301", "aliases": ["THAR-275-301", "COML-267-301", "WSTD-275-301", "ASAM-275-301"]}, {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: King Kong, Monsters and Their Brides", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/8425/sections/401", "id": "8425-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "COML-267-401", "WSTD-275-401", "ASAM-275-401"]}]}, "id": 8425, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "COML-267", "WSTD-275", "ASAM-275"]}
