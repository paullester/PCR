{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "THEATRE CRITICISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2308/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.62", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.62"}, "section": {"name": "TRANSGRESSIVE PERFORM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/2308/sections/601", "id": "2308-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "ENGL-271-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/2308/sections/601/reviews/1190-DAVID-FOX", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1190-DAVID-FOX", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "FOX", "id": "1190-DAVID-FOX", "name": "DAVID FOX"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "2308-601-1190-DAVID-FOX"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/2308", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2308/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEATRE CRITICISM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/2308/sections/401", "id": "2308-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "ENGL-271-401"]}, {"name": "TRANSGRESSIVE PERFORM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-601", "path": "/courses/2308/sections/601", "id": "2308-601", "aliases": ["THAR-275-601", "ENGL-271-601"]}]}, "id": 2308, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "ENGL-271"]}
