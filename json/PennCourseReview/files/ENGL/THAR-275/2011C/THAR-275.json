{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CNTMPRY US DRAMA/THEATRE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25197/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "1.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "1.90", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "CNTMPRY US DRAMA/THEATRE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/25197/sections/401", "id": "25197-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "ENGL-256-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/25197/sections/401/reviews/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "first_name": "JAMES F.", "last_name": "SCHLATTER", "id": "1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "name": "JAMES F.
