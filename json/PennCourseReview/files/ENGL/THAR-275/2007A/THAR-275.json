{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1126"}, "description": "This course will combine an intensive practical and intellectual investigation of some area of the making of theatre: performance techniques, theatrical styles, a particular period of theatre history. For the current topics contact the Theatre Arts office. \n\nOne section of 275 every other Spring will consist of a small number of Theatre Arts majors selected by the faculty to become members of \"the Edinburgh Project.\" This ensemble will mount a production that will be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. Many of the readings and exercises in this course will be geared to prepare for production; rehearsals for the project will continue after the exam period at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Immigration in Theatre and Cinema", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15246/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.70", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.30", "rCourseQuality": "2.10", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.95", "rCommAbility": "2.15", "rInstructorQuality": "2.15"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Immigration in Theatre and Cinema", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/15246/sections/401", "id": "15246-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "CINE-225-401", "COML-267-401", "ENGL-256-401", "GSOC-275-401", "ASAM-275-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/15246/sections/401/reviews/403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY", "first_name": "THERESE M", "last_name": "LAFFERTY", "id": "403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY", "name": "THERESE M LAFFERTY"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "15246-401-403-THERESE-M-LAFFERTY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "2.09", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.18", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: The Philadelphia Theatre Experience", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/15246/sections/402", "id": "15246-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "CINE-225-402", "COML-267-402", "ENGL-256-402", "GSOC-275-402", "ASAM-275-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/15246/sections/402/reviews/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "first_name": "ROSEMARY", "last_name": "MALAGUE", "id": "1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "name": "ROSEMARY MALAGUE"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "15246-402-1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-275", "path": "/courses/15246", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15246/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: Immigration in Theatre and Cinema", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/15246/sections/401", "id": "15246-401", "aliases": ["THAR-275-401", "CINE-225-401", "COML-267-401", "ENGL-256-401", "GSOC-275-401", "ASAM-275-401"]}, {"name": "ADV TPCS IN THEATRE: The Philadelphia Theatre Experience", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-275-402", "path": "/courses/15246/sections/402", "id": "15246-402", "aliases": ["THAR-275-402", "CINE-225-402", "COML-267-402", "ENGL-256-402", "GSOC-275-402", "ASAM-275-402"]}]}, "id": 15246, "aliases": ["THAR-275", "CINE-225", "COML-267", "ENGL-256", "GSOC-275", "ASAM-275"]}
