Readings span the genres of poetry, drama, fiction, and history, including works by Sommerville and Ross, Yeats, George Moore, Joyce, Synge, O'Casey, Beckett, Edna O'Brien, and Brian Friel. The course also involves a trip to see an Irish play in Philadelphia. Written requirements include weekly quizzes, a 10-12 page research paper, and two essay exams.\r\n\r\nMany students considered this course \u201cone of the best courses\u201d they\u2019ve taken at Penn. Though the subjects matter was \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201ccomplex,\u201d it made for an \u201cinteresting and exciting\u201d class. One of the only things students disliked was that there was \u201cnot enough time\u201d to discuss everything they wanted to, although the \u201cquality of in-class discussion [was] consistently high.\u201d. For many students, this course \u201cbroadened their perspectives\u201d and made them \u201cgenuinely interested in Irish literature.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Esty received rave reviews from every student. He was described as \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cpassionate,\u201d and \u201cfantastic.\u201d It is a large seminar, but Professor Esty \u201cmanaged to make it feel warm and personal.\u201d Many students agree that Professor Esty is \u201can extremely informed, intelligent instructor\u201d and \u201cis one of the best professors they have ever had.\u201d He was also \u201cvery accessible and available\u201d outside of class. Overall, Professor Esty received wonderful commentary on his \u201cpassion about the subject matter,\u201d making \u201cit enjoyable to go to class.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis class focused on some of \u201cthe most difficult Irish literature,\u201d and was challenging in terms of the amount and level of work. The average course load is about \u201c30 or more poems\u201d per assignment, but it was \u201ccompletely manageable as far as amount.\u201d Some students thought the \u201creadings were far too heavy\u201d and the course was \u201ca bit too fast paced.\u201d The weekly quizzes and tests were considered \u201cchallenging but fair,\u201d but \u201cabout speed and regurgitating what we had discussed in class.\u201d This course was considered great both for those who are interested in Irish literature and those who might be new to it.", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/25912/sections/001/reviews/4304-JOSHUA-ESTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4304-JOSHUA-ESTY", "first_name": "JOSHUA", "last_name": "ESTY", "id": "4304-JOSHUA-ESTY", "name": "JOSHUA ESTY"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "25912-001-4304-JOSHUA-ESTY"}]
