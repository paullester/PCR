{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2527"}, "description": "This course will provide an introduction to modern Irish literature, focusing on the tension between Ireland's violent history and its heroic mythology. This tension leaves its mark not only on the ravaged landscape, but also on the English language, which displays its \"foreignness\" most strongly in the hands of Irish writers. Readings will span the genres of poetry, drama, fiction, and history, and will include works by Sommerville and Ross, Yeats, George Moore, Joyce, Synge, O'Casey, Beckett, Edna O'Brien, and Brian Friel. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "IRISH LITERATURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15612/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.76", "rCourseQuality": "3.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorAccess": "3.81", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "IRISH LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-058-001", "path": "/courses/15612/sections/001", "id": "15612-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-058-001"]}, "comments": "This course is an introduction to modern Irish literature, beginning with the Celtic Revival of the early 1900s. The class focuses on several key topics: literature and nationalism, language and territory, gender and tradition, art and violence, and sexuality and citizenship. Special attention is paid to the contrast of Ireland\u2019s violent history and its heroic mythology. Students will read books and poetry by Yeats, Joyce, O\u2019Casey, Friel, Synge, etc.\r\nAlthough students found the work for the class to be demanding, they also claimed to have learned a lot about Irish history and writing. Students also admitted to finding a \u201cgreat[er] appreciation for poetry.\u201d The class was described as the \u201cperfect balance of open debate and focused lecture.\u201d\r\nStudents described Professor Esty as \u201centertaining\u201d and \u201cfunny.\u201d He set the bar high for his students and encouraged them to write essays on unfamiliar topics so that they could explore them further.
