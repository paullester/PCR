Primary concerned with poems by Skelton, Wyatt, Surrey, Gascoigne, Sidney, Shakespeare, Spenser, Jonson, Donne, Herbert, Herrick, Marvel, and Milton, this course places special emphasis on the influence of classical and continental poetry in Renaissance England, reading English texts comparatively with texts by Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Petrarch, and du Bellay. The course also examines contemporary critical writing about poetics; debates about the fitness of English to sustain a literture; early efforts to invent a canon of English poets; the issue of translation; and the organization and status of pre-modern genres, like pastoral, epigram and elegy. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24288/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-032-001", "path": "/courses/24288/sections/001", "id": "24288-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-032-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/24288/sections/001/reviews/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "first_name": "MARGRETA", "last_name": "DEGRAZIA", "id": "424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "name": "MARGRETA DEGRAZIA"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "24288-001-424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-032", "path": "/courses/24288", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24288/sections", "values": [{"name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-032-001", "path": "/courses/24288/sections/001", "id": "24288-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-032-001"]}]}, "id": 24288, "aliases": ["ENGL-032"]}
