The course also examines contemporary critical writing about poetics; debates about the fitness of English to sustain a literture; early efforts to invent a canon of English poets; the issue of translation; and the organization and status of pre-modern genres, like pastoral, epigram and elegy. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22952/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-032-001", "path": "/courses/22952/sections/001", "id": "22952-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-032-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/22952/sections/001/reviews/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "first_name": "MARGRETA", "last_name": "DEGRAZIA", "id": "424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "name": "MARGRETA DEGRAZIA"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "22952-001-424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-032", "path": "/courses/22952", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22952/sections", "values": [{"name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-032-001", "path": "/courses/22952/sections/001", "id": "22952-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-032-001"]}]}, "id": 22952, "aliases": ["ENGL-032"]}
