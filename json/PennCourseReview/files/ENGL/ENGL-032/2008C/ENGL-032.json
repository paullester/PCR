The course also examines contemporary critical writing about poetics; debates about the fitness of English to sustain a literture; early efforts to invent a canon of English poets; the issue of translation; and the organization and status of pre-modern genres, like pastoral, epigram and elegy. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS: RENAISSANCE POETRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18549/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "3.15", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.85", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "3.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS: RENAISSANCE POETRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-032-001", "path": "/courses/18549/sections/001", "id": "18549-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-032-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/18549/sections/001/reviews/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "first_name": "MARGRETA", "last_name": "DEGRAZIA", "id": "424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "name": "MARGRETA DEGRAZIA"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "18549-001-424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-032", "path": "/courses/18549", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18549/sections", "values": [{"name": "RENAISSANCE POETICS: RENAISSANCE POETRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-032-001", "path": "/courses/18549/sections/001", "id": "18549-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-032-001"]}]}, "id": 18549, "aliases": ["ENGL-032"]}
