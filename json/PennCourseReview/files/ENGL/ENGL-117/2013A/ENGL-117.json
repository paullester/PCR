{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1814"}, "description": "This is a workshop-oriented course that will concentrate on all aspects of writing about artistic endeavor, including criticism, reviews, profiles, interviews and essays. For the purposes of this class, the arts will be interpreted broadly, and students will be able -- and, in fact, encouraged -- to write about both the fine arts and popular culture. Students will be doing a great deal of writing throughout the course, but the main focus will be a 3000-word piece about an artist or arts organization in Philadelphia (or another location approved by the instructor) that will involve extensive reporting, interviews and research. Potential subjects can range from a local band to a museum, from a theater group to a comedian. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THE ARTS & POPULAR CULT.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30206/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "THE ARTS & POPULAR CULT.", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-117-301", "path": "/courses/30206/sections/301", "id": "30206-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-117-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/30206/sections/301/reviews/1406-ANTHONY-DECURTIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1406-ANTHONY-DECURTIS", "first_name": "ANTHONY", "last_name": "DECURTIS", "id": "1406-ANTHONY-DECURTIS", "name": "ANTHONY DECURTIS"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "30206-301-1406-ANTHONY-DECURTIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-117", "path": "/courses/30206", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30206/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE ARTS & POPULAR CULT.", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-117-301", "path": "/courses/30206/sections/301", "id": "30206-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-117-301"]}]}, "id": 30206, "aliases": ["ENGL-117"]}
