{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2271"}, "description": "Although Shakespeare's plays are usually studied as high canonical literature, they were originally written as playscripts, designed for the entertainment of a disorderly, socially heterogeneous crowd and for the financial profit of the players. This course will attempt to resituate the plays in their original theatrical setting. There will be one or two hour-exams, one or two short papers, and a final exam. There may be unannounced quizzes on the reading assignments. In addition, students are expected to meet in study groups for approximately six hours a week, outside of class. This course is designed for Benjamin Franklin Scholars. Other students will be admitted only with the instructor's permission. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "Shakespeare's Poems and Plays", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4074/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.19", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "Shakespeare's Poems and Plays", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-335-301", "path": "/courses/4074/sections/301", "id": "4074-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-335-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/4074/sections/301/reviews/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "first_name": "MARGRETA", "last_name": "DEGRAZIA", "id": "424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA", "name": "MARGRETA DEGRAZIA"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "4074-301-424-MARGRETA-DEGRAZIA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-335", "path": "/courses/4074", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4074/sections", "values": [{"name": "Shakespeare's Poems and Plays", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-335-301", "path": "/courses/4074/sections/301", "id": "4074-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-335-301"]}]}, "id": 4074, "aliases": ["ENGL-335"]}
