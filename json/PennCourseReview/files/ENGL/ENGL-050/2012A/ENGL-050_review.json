A time of renaissance and upheaval, it's an age essential to understanding our own modernity, one that gave us modern economics and chemistry, democracy and dictatorship, chemistry and the cult of celebrity, science fiction and the secret service. Students read Jane Austen and Lord Byron, Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft, John Keats and Mary Shelley, among others. Along the way, the course also covers the events that shaped the fiction, poetry, and drama of these turbulent years. The aim is to understand our readings both as texts in themselves (as responses to literary and cultural traditions) and as public statements (as responses to contemporary events and culture).
