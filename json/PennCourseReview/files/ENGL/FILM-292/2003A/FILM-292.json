{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1296"}, "description": "The course will consist of a broad and varied sampling of classic Italian films from WWII to the present. We will consider the works which typify major directors and major trends through five decades of filmmaking. We will trace a certain stylistic and thematic development from WWII to the present, pointing out both the continuity of the tradition and exceptions to it, in an attempt to define the art of Italian film. Units will include \"Neorealism: The Cinematic Revolution,\" \"Self-Reflexivity and Meta-Cinema,\" Fascism and War Revisited,\" and \"Postmodernism, or the Death of Cinema.\" One of the aims of the course will be to make us aware of the expectations that Hollywood has implanted in us: that films be action-packed wish-fulfillment fantasies. Italian cinema will challenge us to re-examine and revise the very narrow conception that we Americans have of the cinematic medium. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "NARRATIVES IN WORLD FILM: Innovations in Narrative Film: From Vertigo to Run Lola Run", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1607/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.39", "rWorkRequired": "1.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.39", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "NARRATIVES IN WORLD FILM: Innovations in Narrative Film: From Vertigo to Run Lola Run", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FILM-292-401", "path": "/courses/1607/sections/401", "id": "1607-401", "aliases": ["FILM-292-401", "ENGL-294-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/1607/sections/401/reviews/465-RUTH-PERLMUTTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/465-RUTH-PERLMUTTER", "first_name": "RUTH", "last_name": "PERLMUTTER", "id": "465-RUTH-PERLMUTTER", "name": "RUTH PERLMUTTER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "1607-401-465-RUTH-PERLMUTTER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FILM-292", "path": "/courses/1607", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1607/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRATIVES IN WORLD FILM: Innovations in Narrative Film: From Vertigo to Run Lola Run", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FILM-292-401", "path": "/courses/1607/sections/401", "id": "1607-401", "aliases": ["FILM-292-401", "ENGL-294-401"]}]}, "id": 1607, "aliases": ["FILM-292", "ENGL-294"]}
