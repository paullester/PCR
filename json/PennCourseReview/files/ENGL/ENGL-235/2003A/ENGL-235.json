{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/408"}, "description": "This course will see how theatre artists have built theatre pieces from Shakespeare's scripts, starting from the time that the theatres reopened during the Restoration, when theatrical aesthetics had changed and the continuity of theatrical tradition from Shakespeare's own theatre had been broken. We will consider how different social, political, and theatrical cultures re-envisioned the scripts, how they work in theatre, how this different vision of the scripts affected what they became, how they worked, in the theatre of the day. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "SHAKESPEARE'S WOMEN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1565/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "2.32", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.79", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.16", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58", "rReadingsValue": "3.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.26", "rCommAbility": "3.74", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58"}, "section": {"name": "SHAKESPEARE'S WOMEN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-235-301", "path": "/courses/1565/sections/301", "id": "1565-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-235-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/1565/sections/301/reviews/1398-BARBARA-RIEBLING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1398-BARBARA-RIEBLING", "first_name": "BARBARA", "last_name": "RIEBLING", "id": "1398-BARBARA-RIEBLING", "name": "BARBARA RIEBLING"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "1565-301-1398-BARBARA-RIEBLING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-235", "path": "/courses/1565", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1565/sections", "values": [{"name": "SHAKESPEARE'S WOMEN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-235-301", "path": "/courses/1565/sections/301", "id": "1565-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-235-301"]}]}, "id": 1565, "aliases": ["ENGL-235"]}
