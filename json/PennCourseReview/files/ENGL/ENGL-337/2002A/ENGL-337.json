{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/431"}, "description": "Although Shakespeare's plays are usually studied as high canonical literature they were originally written as playscripts, designed for the entertainment of a disorderly, socially heterogeneous audience and the financial profit of the players. This course will attempt to re-situate the plays in their original theatrical setting. Readings will include material on the theaters of Shakespeare's time as well as a representative selection of plays. We will act out scenes from the plays as well as discuss them and we will explore the theatrical use and cultural implications of devices such as the comic subplot, the play within the play, and the boy heroine. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "SPCL TOPICS:SHAKESPEARE: Shakespeare and Cultural Difference", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/431/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.92", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.15", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "SPCL TOPICS:SHAKESPEARE: Shakespeare and Cultural Difference", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-337-301", "path": "/courses/431/sections/301", "id": "431-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-337-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/431/sections/301/reviews/441-JEAN-E-HOWARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/441-JEAN-E-HOWARD", "first_name": "JEAN E", "last_name": "HOWARD", "id": "441-JEAN-E-HOWARD", "name": "JEAN E HOWARD"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "431-301-441-JEAN-E-HOWARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-337", "path": "/courses/431", "sections": {"path": "/courses/431/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPCL TOPICS:SHAKESPEARE: Shakespeare and Cultural Difference", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-337-301", "path": "/courses/431/sections/301", "id": "431-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-337-301"]}]}, "id": 431, "aliases": ["ENGL-337"]}
