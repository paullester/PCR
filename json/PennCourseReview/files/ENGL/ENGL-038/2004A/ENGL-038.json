It saw the execution of one kind and the restoration of another, and surved the English Civil War and the great Fire and Great Plague of London. This course explores the literature of this century through the works of John Milton Milton's major works (selected sonnets, Comus, Areopagitica, Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes), and his contemporaries.
