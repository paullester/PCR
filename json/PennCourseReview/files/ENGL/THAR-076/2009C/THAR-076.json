{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3784"}, "description": "This course will investigate the state of the contemporary, non-profit theatre culture of Philadelphia by examining the history, artistic mission, and current production work of selected city theatre companies. This course will also explore the creative process of theatre-making as undertaken by these theatres through the reading of plays being produced by them this fall, through an analysis of the collaborative contribution of the playwright, director, actors, and designers to the creation of a production, and, finally, through attendance at those productions mounted by the theatre companies under investigation. The members of the class will write individual essays responding to these productions, do research and give group presentations on other Philadelphia theatre companies, and participate daily in a spirited dialogue about the vitality, level of artistic accomplishment, and cultural/social value of contemporary theatre in Philadelphia \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "THEATRE IN PHILADELPHIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18144/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.06", "rDifficulty": "1.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.41", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.59", "rWorkRequired": "1.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.24", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.53", "rCommAbility": "2.59", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "THEATRE IN PHILADELPHIA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-076-301", "path": "/courses/18144/sections/301", "id": "18144-301", "aliases": ["THAR-076-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/18144/sections/301/reviews/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "first_name": "JAMES F.", "last_name": "SCHLATTER", "id": "1183-JAMES-F--SCHLATTER", "name": "JAMES F.
