{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4142"}, "description": "How does one read a play? Theatre, as a discipline, focuses on the traditions of live performance. In those traditions, a play text must be read not only as a piece of literature, but as a kind of \"blueprint\" from which productions are built. This course will introduce students to a variety of approaches to reading plays and performance pieces. Drawing on a wide range of dramatic texts from different periods and places, we will examine how plays are made, considering issues such as structure, genre, style, character, and language, as well as the use of time, space, and theatrical effects. Although the course is devoted to the reading and analysis of plays, we will also view selected live and/or filmed versions of several of the scripts we study, assessing their translation from page to stage. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "THE PLAY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16531/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "1.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.33", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "THE PLAY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-125-301", "path": "/courses/16531/sections/301", "id": "16531-301", "aliases": ["THAR-125-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/16531/sections/301/reviews/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "first_name": "ROSEMARY", "last_name": "MALAGUE", "id": "1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE", "name": "ROSEMARY MALAGUE"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "16531-301-1181-ROSEMARY-MALAGUE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-125", "path": "/courses/16531", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16531/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE PLAY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "THAR-125-301", "path": "/courses/16531/sections/301", "id": "16531-301", "aliases": ["THAR-125-301"]}]}, "id": 16531, "aliases": ["THAR-125"]}
