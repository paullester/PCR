{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3362"}, "description": "A new creative writing course built entirely around the use of photographs, and the crafting of compelling nonfiction narratives from them. The essential concept will be to employ photographs as storytelling vehicles. So we will be using curling, drugstore printed Kodak shots from our own family albums. We will be using searing and famous images from history books. We will be taking things from yesterday's newspaper. We will even be using pictures that were just made by the workshop participants outside the campus gates with a disposable camera from CVS or with their own sophisticated digital Nikon. In all of this, there will be one overriding aim to achieve memorable, full-bodied stories. To locate the strange, evocative, storytelling universes that are sealed inside the four rectangular walls of photograph. They are always there, if you know how to look. It's about the quality of your noticing, the intensity of your seeing. \n\nSee the English Department's websitee at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "PHOTOGRAPHS AND STORIES: Telling Stories out of Photographs", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8821/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.62", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.23", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "PHOTOGRAPHS AND STORIES: Telling Stories out of Photographs", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-156-301", "path": "/courses/8821/sections/301", "id": "8821-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-156-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/8821/sections/301/reviews/438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "HENDRICKSON", "id": "438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "name": "PAUL HENDRICKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "8821-301-438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-156", "path": "/courses/8821", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8821/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHOTOGRAPHS AND STORIES: Telling Stories out of Photographs", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-156-301", "path": "/courses/8821/sections/301", "id": "8821-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-156-301"]}]}, "id": 8821, "aliases": ["ENGL-156"]}
