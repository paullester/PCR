{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3372"}, "description": "This course takes students into the exiting world of telling stories for the visual medium of film. We will learn the current professional screenplay format, read classic screenplays (i.e. USUAL SUSPECTS, BLADE RUNNER, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, CHINATOWN) and closely analyze both the texts and the actual films they spawned. Much attention will be paid to creating complex characters who speak in compelling, delineated voices. Each workshop participant will be expected to write a short screenplay of 12-15 pages (with a beginning, middle and end) and have it read in class where it will be thoroughly discussed by both the instructor and the group. Outlining the story and the architecture of narrative structure are of paramount importance to us so much time will be devoted to this area. Each student will be expected to keep a JOURNAL for the class, detailing their development in what is a truly challenging medium. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "SCREENWRITING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8846/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "2.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09"}, "section": {"name": "SCREENWRITING", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "ENGL-416-640", "path": "/courses/8846/sections/640", "id": "8846-640", "aliases": ["ENGL-416-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/8846/sections/640/reviews/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/431-MARC-LAPADULA", "first_name": "MARC", "last_name": "LAPADULA", "id": "431-MARC-LAPADULA", "name": "MARC LAPADULA"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "8846-640-431-MARC-LAPADULA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-416", "path": "/courses/8846", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8846/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCREENWRITING", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "ENGL-416-640", "path": "/courses/8846/sections/640", "id": "8846-640", "aliases": ["ENGL-416-640"]}]}, "id": 8846, "aliases": ["ENGL-416"]}
