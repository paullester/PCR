The class discusses the pieces -- who is the writer representing, to whom are they speaking, what are facts are they highlighting -- in an effort to understand better how to best present their own writing. \r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed this \u201cfantastic\u201d course\u2019s \u201cfun and liberating classroom vibe.\u201d Though the course was not considered especially challenging, many students found that their writing improved over the span of the semester.\r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Aptowicz \u201centhusiastic and knowledgeable.\u201d They praised her ability to think up \u201cunusually creative\u201d assignments and to give excellent feedback. Students were pleased with Professor Aptowicz\u2019 teaching style, calling her \u201cinspiring\u201d overall.\r\n\r\nBoth majors and non-majors found this course interesting. A non-major recalled feeling \u201cextremely welcomed\u201d in the classroom environment and was pleased to be graded on effort more heavily than ability. Aside from the final portfolio, students were expected to generate a high volume of poetry and short non-fiction inspired by the works examined in class.
