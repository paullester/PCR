{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4940"}, "description": "This course will focus on the most revolutionary period in contemporary journalism - the 1960s, when writers such as Tom Wolfe, Michael Herr, Gay Talese, Anthony Lukas, Norman Mailer, and Thomas B. Morgan vastly expanded the possibilities of non-fiction. Dubbed \"the new journalism,\" its practitioners adapted certain aspects of the novel (scenes, dialogue, structure) in order to better tell true-life stories. Students in this course will read extensively, to understand how these breakthrough writers have profoundly influenced the long-form journalism of today. A book about the New Journalism, \"The Gang That Couldn't Write Straight,\" will be used as a reference. Each student will also write a long-form journalistic piece, using many elements of the form. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "RDG/WRTG--NEW JOURNALISM: Long-Form Journalistic Writing", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27314/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.45", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "3.73", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "2.91", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "RDG/WRTG--NEW JOURNALISM: Long-Form Journalistic Writing", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-160-301", "path": "/courses/27314/sections/301", "id": "27314-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-160-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/27314/sections/301/reviews/438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "HENDRICKSON", "id": "438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "name": "PAUL HENDRICKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "27314-301-438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-160", "path": "/courses/27314", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27314/sections", "values": [{"name": "RDG/WRTG--NEW JOURNALISM: Long-Form Journalistic Writing", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-160-301", "path": "/courses/27314/sections/301", "id": "27314-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-160-301"]}]}, "id": 27314, "aliases": ["ENGL-160"]}
