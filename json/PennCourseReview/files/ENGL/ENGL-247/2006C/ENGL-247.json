{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3367"}, "description": "Since the seventeenth century, a distinctly urban literature has evolved about London and its culture. That literature has taken many forms, and regards the city from varying perspectives, including the center for crime and corruption, disease and perversion; a locus of government, clandestine operations, learning and science, and so on. In this course, we will likely read authors like Jonson, Defoe, Gay, Dickens, Wilde, Conrad, Woolf, Greene, and Pinter. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "LONDON AND LITERATURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8829/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "LONDON AND LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-247-301", "path": "/courses/8829/sections/301", "id": "8829-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-247-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/8829/sections/301/reviews/2118-ERIN-K-O-CONNOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2118-ERIN-K-O-CONNOR", "first_name": "ERIN K", "last_name": "O'CONNOR", "id": "2118-ERIN-K-O-CONNOR", "name": "ERIN K O'CONNOR"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "8829-301-2118-ERIN-K-O-CONNOR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-247", "path": "/courses/8829", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8829/sections", "values": [{"name": "LONDON AND LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-247-301", "path": "/courses/8829/sections/301", "id": "8829-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-247-301"]}]}, "id": 8829, "aliases": ["ENGL-247"]}
