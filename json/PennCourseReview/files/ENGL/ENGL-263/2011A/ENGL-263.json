The course material looks at the genre of crime fiction and literary novels in which crime plays a central role, along with the Hollywood film noir and contemporary police procedural television shows. Readings include works by Cormac McCarthy, Truman Capote and Alice Sebold, and are supplemented with films directed by Orson Welles, David Cronenberg and Spike Lee.\r\n\r\nStudents considered ENGL 263 to be a \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201centertaining\u201d course, with one calling it the \u201chighlight\u201d of the semester. They greatly applauded the selected material, with one student pointing to the volume of more current selected works making the course\u2019s topics something easy to \u201crelate to.\u201d This was bolstered by the engaging discussion present in each lesson. One student felt that the class needed more structure, but he/she was alone in holding this sentiment \u2013 the vast majority greatly enjoyed all aspects of the course. One student proclaimed that it was \u201cexactly what [he/she] hoped a class at a liberal arts school would be.\u201d Another said simply, \u201cawesome class!\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Fiumara received high praise from students. Called an \u201capproachable and engaging professor,\u201d students felt he had a \u201cgenuine interest in the success of his students.\u201d They lauded his ability to create an atmosphere that \u201cmade participation easy, even fun,\u201d which lent greatly to the class discussions. But, one student felt that Professor Fiumara was perhaps \u201ctoo nice,\u201d and that he \u201ccut everyone so much slack\u201d out of his perceived value of in-class discussion over assigned work.\r\n\r\nThe workload was considered quite manageable, as the engaging nature of the readings and films made the material enjoyable. Students were initially asked to write two essays and a final paper, though the second essay and the final paper were eventually dropped. As mentioned, not all students were pleased with the decreased number of assignments, though this was a testament to student satisfaction with both the material and discussion.\r\n", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/21618/sections/301/reviews/3913-JAMES-J--FIUMARA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3913-JAMES-J--FIUMARA", "first_name": "JAMES J.", "last_name": "FIUMARA", "id": "3913-JAMES-J--FIUMARA", "name": "JAMES J.
