{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5054"}, "description": "You proabably read Poe first in junior high, and his works are often treated as juvenile: cheap thrills, campy horror,self-indulgent longing. But Poe also engaged with the most serious issues faced by his period, from politics and philosphy to industralization and science. His works dealt with these concerns in a variety of ways, while reflecting all along about the conditions of literature in a newly commercialized marketplace. This seminar will look at Poe's literary innovations through the lens of the developing technology and science of the early republic. It will examine the political importance of new institutions for research and diffusion as well as various emerging venues for popular science, including the journals in which Poe wrote as an early science reporter. The course thus explores the peculiar situtation of science and technology in the early USA, at the same time as it reveals the varied and complex literary production of Poe in a new and revealing light. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "EDGAR ALLAN POE'S SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22489/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.93", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "EDGAR ALLAN POE'S SCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-322-301", "path": "/courses/22489/sections/301", "id": "22489-301", "aliases": ["STSC-322-301", "ENGL-248-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/22489/sections/301/reviews/4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "first_name": "JOHN", "last_name": "TRESCH", "id": "4131-JOHN-TRESCH", "name": "JOHN TRESCH"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "22489-301-4131-JOHN-TRESCH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "STSC-322", "path": "/courses/22489", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22489/sections", "values": [{"name": "EDGAR ALLAN POE'S SCI", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "STSC-322-301", "path": "/courses/22489/sections/301", "id": "22489-301", "aliases": ["STSC-322-301", "ENGL-248-301"]}]}, "id": 22489, "aliases": ["STSC-322", "ENGL-248"]}
