{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1532"}, "description": "This course will investigate the history of 20th century American theatre through readings of the works of major playwrights, inlcuding Eugene O'Neill, Clifford Odets, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, David Mamet, Sam Shepard, August Wilson, and others. In reading and in class discussions, we will focus not only on the plays but also on the particular historical and theatrical moments which produced those plays. We will examine theatre companies such as the Provincetown Players, the Group theatre and the Negro Ensemble Company, the regional theatre movement, off and off-off Broadway, the impact of the Depression and the W.P.A. on theatre-making, new theatre forms such as performance art and one-person shows (Spalding Gray, Anna Deveare Smith). The goal of this course is to chart the living history of American theatre as it shapes and reshapes itself to respond to the urgent social, political and spiritual needs of the American national community. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "GREENWICH VILLAGE ARTS: Arts, Culture and Theatre", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2310/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-475", "path": "/courses/2310", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2310/sections", "values": [{"name": "GREENWICH VILLAGE ARTS: Arts, Culture and Theatre", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "THAR-475-640", "path": "/courses/2310/sections/640", "id": "2310-640", "aliases": ["THAR-475-640", "ENGL-471-640"]}]}, "id": 2310, "aliases": ["THAR-475", "ENGL-471"]}
