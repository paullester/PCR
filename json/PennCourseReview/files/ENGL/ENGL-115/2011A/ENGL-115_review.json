Class meetings consist of discussions based on student-penned stories.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that ENGL 115 was a challenging yet rewarding course. While the course was considered demanding at times, students remarked that the lessons helped their writing \u201cdevelop exponentially.\u201d One commented that the content and the guidance of Professor Apple, pushed him/her to \u201creconsider writing as an art form with nuances and challenges.\u201d It did not come without criticism, however, as one student cautioned that the course was too focused on \u201ca certain genre of fiction,\u201d and that this can be \u201cdamaging for students who are interested in writing different genres.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the most part, students had glowing comments about Professor Apple. Described as \u201cincredible,\u201d \u201cwise,\u201d \u201cwarm,\u201d and \u201cthe man,\u201d students considered him \u201cthe ideal professor.\u201d Though one complained that his style of offering feedback was \u201caggressive,\u201d others found him to be encouraging. The majority of students felt that his direction helped strengthen them as writers, and several noted their desire to enroll in his other courses in the future. As one student stated succinctly, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to take another class\u201d with Professor Apple.\r\n\r\nOverall, the workload was considered challenging but manageable. Students were asked to write three stories during the semester, and were given recommended, but not required, readings. Grades were based on said writings, attendance and class participation.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/21594/sections/301/reviews/436-MAX-APPLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/436-MAX-APPLE", "first_name": "MAX", "last_name": "APPLE", "id": "436-MAX-APPLE", "name": "MAX APPLE"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "21594-301-436-MAX-APPLE"}]
