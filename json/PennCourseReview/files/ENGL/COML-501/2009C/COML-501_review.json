These include questions about aesthetics and cultural value, about ideology and hegemony, about the patriarchal and colonial bases of Western culture, and about the status of the cultural object, the cultural critic, and cultural theory itself.&#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents complained about the structure of the class and believed that more lecturing would have been helpful. Discussion was described as being \u201cunfocused and digressive\u201d and many felt that the over-utilization of student presentations was not the best way to study the dense subject matter. \r\n&#8232;&#8232;Students had mixed feelings regarding Professor Jarosinski, as several commented that he \u201cseems to be incredibly intelligent, responsive and caring.\u201d However, the large class size contributed to the consensus that Professor Jarosinski did not adequately control discussion and lessened the value of the course. In addition, students wished the Professor played a more central role in the class instead of relying so heavily on student presentations. &#8232;\r\n&#8232;Students did not recommend this class for fellow students and generally did not feel that they learned a great deal from the course.\r\n", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/17162/sections/401/reviews/3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI", "first_name": "ERIC", "last_name": "JAROSINSKI", "id": "3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI", "name": "ERIC JAROSINSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "17162-401-3980-ERIC-JAROSINSKI"}]
