All will provide students with the opportunity to test the advantages and limitations of a variety of critical approaches to the novel as a genre. Readings may include works by Behn, Swift, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Lennox, Smollett, Burney, Scott, Austen, the Brontes, Dickens, Eliot, Hardy, Conrad, Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, Rhys, Greene, Naipaul, Carter, Rushdie, and Coetzee. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "THE RISE OF THE NOVEL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10295/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.05", "rDifficulty": "2.05", "rStimulateInterest": "1.79", "rRecommendMajor": "2.74", "rCourseQuality": "2.37", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "2.78", "rReadingsValue": "2.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "2.26", "rInstructorQuality": "2.42"}, "section": {"name": "THE RISE OF THE NOVEL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-060-001", "path": "/courses/10295/sections/001", "id": "10295-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-060-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/10295/sections/001/reviews/373-PAUL-KINTZELE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/373-PAUL-KINTZELE", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "KINTZELE", "id": "373-PAUL-KINTZELE", "name": "PAUL KINTZELE"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "10295-001-373-PAUL-KINTZELE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-060", "path": "/courses/10295", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10295/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE RISE OF THE NOVEL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-060-001", "path": "/courses/10295/sections/001", "id": "10295-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-060-001"]}]}, "id": 10295, "aliases": ["ENGL-060"]}
