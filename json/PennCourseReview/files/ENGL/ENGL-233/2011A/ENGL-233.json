{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/407"}, "description": "In this course, we will be reading both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures, with particular attention to English translations of Genesis, the Psalms and the Gospels. While the main focus will be on the scriptural texts, we will also be exploring how Medieval and Renaissance drama and poetry incorporated and transformed those texts. Readings for the course will include selections from the mystery plays, Julian of Norwich, and the poetry of John Donne, George Herbert, and John Milton. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "TPCS IN THE BIBLE AS LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21610/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.87", "rDifficulty": "1.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.93", "rCourseQuality": "2.81", "rWorkRequired": "1.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "TPCS IN THE BIBLE AS LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-233-401", "path": "/courses/21610/sections/401", "id": "21610-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-233-401", "RELS-234-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/21610/sections/401/reviews/453-PETER-STALLYBRASS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/453-PETER-STALLYBRASS", "first_name": "PETER", "last_name": "STALLYBRASS", "id": "453-PETER-STALLYBRASS", "name": "PETER STALLYBRASS"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "21610-401-453-PETER-STALLYBRASS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-233", "path": "/courses/21610", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21610/sections", "values": [{"name": "TPCS IN THE BIBLE AS LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-233-401", "path": "/courses/21610/sections/401", "id": "21610-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-233-401", "RELS-234-401"]}]}, "id": 21610, "aliases": ["ENGL-233", "RELS-234"]}
