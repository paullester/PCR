Typically, this course will contain materials from the later seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries--from the Restoration and Glorious Revolution through the Englightenment, the American and French Revolutions, and the Napoloeonic Wars--though it need not cover the entire period. We will read plays, poetry and prose in order to understand the aesthetic, intellectual, social and political issues to literary production and achievement in this period. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "18TH-C BRIT LIT & CULTR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8792/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "18TH-C BRIT LIT & CULTR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-041-001", "path": "/courses/8792/sections/001", "id": "8792-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-041-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/8792/sections/001/reviews/3282-CHI-MING-YANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3282-CHI-MING-YANG", "first_name": "CHI-MING", "last_name": "YANG", "id": "3282-CHI-MING-YANG", "name": "CHI-MING YANG"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "8792-001-3282-CHI-MING-YANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-041", "path": "/courses/8792", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8792/sections", "values": [{"name": "18TH-C BRIT LIT & CULTR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-041-001", "path": "/courses/8792/sections/001", "id": "8792-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-041-001"]}]}, "id": 8792, "aliases": ["ENGL-041"]}
