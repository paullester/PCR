{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/405"}, "description": "This course will function as a workshop, with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of \"documentary\" writing. The word \"documentary\" has meant many things over time. Here, it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155, a student writer at Penn will dare to \"hang\" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end, each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long, at minimum. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "DOCUMENTARY WRITING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25931/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.73", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.91"}, "section": {"name": "DOCUMENTARY WRITING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-155-301", "path": "/courses/25931/sections/301", "id": "25931-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-155-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/25931/sections/301/reviews/438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "HENDRICKSON", "id": "438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON", "name": "PAUL HENDRICKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "25931-301-438-PAUL-HENDRICKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-155", "path": "/courses/25931", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25931/sections", "values": [{"name": "DOCUMENTARY WRITING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ENGL-155-301", "path": "/courses/25931/sections/301", "id": "25931-301", "aliases": ["ENGL-155-301"]}]}, "id": 25931, "aliases": ["ENGL-155"]}
