{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/313"}, "description": "Parallel processing tries to take advantage of the presence of multiple processors in an architecture. Here is an analogy. If one mechanic can fix ten cars in ten days, can ten mechanics fix ten cars in one day? Can they fix 100 cars in ten days? Obviously, both answers depend on the size of the garage and its organization. The course will provide an introduction to modern parallel algorithms, and to parallel programming languages in which such algorithms can be implemented, and which can be compiled on the above-mentioned parallel architectures. Homeworks and projects consist of programming assignments and performance measurements, using a shared-memory multiprocessor system. Relevant buzzwords: supercomputers, high-performance computing. \n\nThe course will provide an introduction to modern parallel architectures, to solving common computational problems through parallel algorithms, and to parallel programming languages in which such algorithms can be implemented, and which can be compiled on the above-mentioned parallel architectures.
