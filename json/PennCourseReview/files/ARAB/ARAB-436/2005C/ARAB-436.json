{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3714"}, "description": "This course aims to provide incoming graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with an introduction to issues in Arabic grammar and syntax that commonly arise in pre-modern Arabic texts. Students will also be introduced to, and expected to consult, the standard reference works used as aids in reading such texts. Students will be expected to prepare a text or set of texts assigned by the instructor for each session. Preparation means, for these purposes, supplying all vowels and other necessary diacritical marks, as well as looking up unfamiliar words and constructions in appropriate dictionaries or other reference works. Regular attendance and thorough preparation are essential to success in this course. It is intended that, upon completion of this course, students will be able to work independently with a wide variety of pre-modern Arabic texts. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "INTR CLASSIC ARABIC TXTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11423/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "INTR CLASSIC ARABIC TXTS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ARAB-436-301", "path": "/courses/11423/sections/301", "id": "11423-301", "aliases": ["ARAB-436-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/11423/sections/301/reviews/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "first_name": "JOSEPH E.", "last_name": "LOWRY", "id": "2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "name": "JOSEPH E.
