{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3525"}, "description": "This is the beginners' course in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). It will introduce the student to speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills in the standard means of communication in the Arabic world. The course is proficiency-based, implying that all activities are aimed at placing the student in the context of the native-speaking environment from the very beginning. Evaluation is done by the more traditional testing methods (vocabulary tests, dictations, grammar and translation exercises). We anticipate that by the end of this course students will range in proficiency from Novice High to Intermediate Low on the ACTFL scale; in other words (using the terminology of the government's Foreign Service Institute) from 'incipient survival' to 'full survival' in the native-speaking environment. \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "INTEN ELEM ARABIC I&II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28292/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARAB-131", "path": "/courses/28292", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28292/sections", "values": []}, "id": 28292, "aliases": ["ARAB-131"]}
