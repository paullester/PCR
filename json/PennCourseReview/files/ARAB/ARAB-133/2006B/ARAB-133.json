{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3526"}, "description": "This is a six-week intensive course offered in the summer through the College of General Studies; see the Penn Summer Course Guide. This is the continuation of ARAB031-32 or ARAB 131, the elementary course in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This course is also proficiency-based, implying that all activities within the course are aimed at placing the student in the context of the native-speaking environment from the very beginning. As in ARAB 031-032 or ARAB 131, evaluation is done by the more traditional testing methods (vocabulary tests, grammar and translation exercises). Completion of this course fulfills the College of Arts and Sciences language requirement in Arabic. However, it should be emphasized that the student will need a longer period of study to achieve proficiency in Arabic. We anticipate that students range from Intermediate Low to Intermediate High according to the ACTFL scale. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "INTEN INTRM ARABIC I&II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9647/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.60", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.60", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.80", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.80", "rInstructorConcern": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rClassPace": "2.40", "rExamsConsistent": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rGradeFairness": "3.80", "rArticulateGoals": "3.60", "rOralSkills": "3.60", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rInstructorEffective": "4.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "INTEN INTRM ARABIC I&II", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "ARAB-133-910", "path": "/courses/9647/sections/910", "id": "9647-910", "aliases": ["ARAB-133-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/9647/sections/910/reviews/2386-HASSAN-NITAMI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2386-HASSAN-NITAMI", "first_name": "HASSAN", "last_name": "NITAMI", "id": "2386-HASSAN-NITAMI", "name": "HASSAN NITAMI"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "9647-910-2386-HASSAN-NITAMI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARAB-133", "path": "/courses/9647", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9647/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEN INTRM ARABIC I&II", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "ARAB-133-910", "path": "/courses/9647/sections/910", "id": "9647-910", "aliases": ["ARAB-133-910"]}]}, "id": 9647, "aliases": ["ARAB-133"]}
