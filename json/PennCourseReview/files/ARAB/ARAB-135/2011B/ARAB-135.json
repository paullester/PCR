{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5277"}, "description": "This is a six-week intensive course offered in the summer through the College of General Studies; see Penn Summer Course Guide. It continues from the first intermediate course, ARAB 033/034 or ARAB 133. Emphasis continues to be on all four language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Students will be expected to give classroom presentations and to write short essays in Arabic. Evaluation will be both achievement-based and proficiency-based. There is no Oral Proficiency Interview at the end of this session, but we anticipate that by the end of this, third year students will range in proficiency from Intermediate High to Advanced Mid on the ACTFL scale. \n\n", "semester": "2011B", "name": "INTEN ADV INTR ARAB I&II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25259/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "4.00", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "1.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rClassPace": "3.50", "rExamsConsistent": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rGradeFairness": "3.50", "rArticulateGoals": "3.00", "rOralSkills": "3.50", "rNativeAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rInstructorEffective": "3.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTEN ADV INTR ARAB I&II", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "ARAB-135-910", "path": "/courses/25259/sections/910", "id": "25259-910", "aliases": ["ARAB-135-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/25259/sections/910/reviews/5285-ABEER-ALOUSH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5285-ABEER-ALOUSH", "first_name": "ABEER", "last_name": "ALOUSH", "id": "5285-ABEER-ALOUSH", "name": "ABEER ALOUSH"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "25259-910-5285-ABEER-ALOUSH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARAB-135", "path": "/courses/25259", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25259/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEN ADV INTR ARAB I&II", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "ARAB-135-910", "path": "/courses/25259/sections/910", "id": "25259-910", "aliases": ["ARAB-135-910"]}]}, "id": 25259, "aliases": ["ARAB-135"]}
