{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3998"}, "description": "The primary goal of this course is to introduce undergraduate students to reading the Qur'an in Arabic. Through the reading and study of selected major Qur'anic narratives, students will become familiar with Qur'anic vocabulary, style, recitation practices, and other intricacies of the Qur'anic text. All students will also memorize a short aura of their choice and practice reciting it in an aesthetically appropriate manner (typically sura 1, 112, 113, or 114). In addition, through in-class discussion of the text in Arabic and Arabic writing assignments, students will reinforce their Arabic speaking, listening, and writing skills. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "RDGS IN QUR'AN & TAFSIR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14088/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "RDGS IN QUR'AN & TAFSIR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ARAB-333-301", "path": "/courses/14088/sections/301", "id": "14088-301", "aliases": ["ARAB-333-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/14088/sections/301/reviews/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "first_name": "JOSEPH E.", "last_name": "LOWRY", "id": "2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "name": "JOSEPH E.
