This course is also proficiency-based, implying that all activities within the course are aimed at placing you, the learner, in the context of the native-speaking environment from the very beginning. This is the continuation of ARAB031 and ARAB 032, the elementary course in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This course is also proficiency-based, implying that all activites within the couse are aimed at placing you, the learner, in the context of the native-speaking environment from the very beginning. As in ARAB 031-032, evaluation is done by the more traditional testing methods (vocabulary tests, grammar and translation exercises). We anticipate that students range from Intermediate Low to Intermediate High according to the ACTFL scale. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE ARABIC III", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12870/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.47", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.58", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.47", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rInstructorConcern": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rClassPace": "2.32", "rExamsConsistent": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rGradeFairness": "3.21", "rArticulateGoals": "3.37", "rOralSkills": "3.05", "rNativeAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "3.26", "rInstructorEffective": "3.53", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE ARABIC III", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ARAB-033-401", "path": "/courses/12870/sections/401", "id": "12870-401", "aliases": ["ARAB-033-401", "ARAB-633-401"]}, "comments": "Students thought that the professor was very encouraging although they wish there was more opportunity to speak the language.
