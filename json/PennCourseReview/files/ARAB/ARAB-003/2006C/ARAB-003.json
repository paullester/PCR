{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3280"}, "description": "This is the continuation of ARAB001 and ARAB 002, the elementary course in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This course is also proficiency-based, implying that all activites within the couse are aimed at placing you, the learner, in the context of the native-speaking environment from the very beginning. As in ARAB 001-002, evaluation is done by the more traditional testing methods (vocabulary tests, grammar and translation exercises). Completion of this course fulfulls the College of General Studies language requirement in Arabic but not the requirement of the School of Arts and Sciences. However, it should be emphasized that you will need a longer period of study to achieve proficiency in Arabic. We anticipate that students range from Intermediate Low to Intermediate High according to the ACTFL scale. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "CONTINUING ARABIC III", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8520/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.25", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rInstructorConcern": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "4.00", "rOralSkills": "3.50", "rNativeAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rInstructorEffective": "3.25", "rSkillEmphasis": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "CONTINUING ARABIC III", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARAB-003-601", "path": "/courses/8520/sections/601", "id": "8520-601", "aliases": ["ARAB-003-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/8520/sections/601/reviews/2852-KHALED-SAYED", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2852-KHALED-SAYED", "first_name": "KHALED", "last_name": "SAYED", "id": "2852-KHALED-SAYED", "name": "KHALED SAYED"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "8520-601-2852-KHALED-SAYED"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARAB-003", "path": "/courses/8520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8520/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTINUING ARABIC III", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARAB-003-601", "path": "/courses/8520/sections/601", "id": "8520-601", "aliases": ["ARAB-003-601"]}]}, "id": 8520, "aliases": ["ARAB-003"]}
