{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3189"}, "description": "This course is an intensive and focused introduction to social gerontology as a trans-disciplinary lens through which to examine aspects of social structure, actions, and consequences in an aging society. A variety of sources are employed to introduce students from any field focused on human behavior and interaction to classical notions of social gerontology and current scholarly inquiry in gerontology. Field work in the tradition of thick thickdescription creates a mechanism to engage students in newly gerontological understandings of their life worlds and daily interactions. Weekly field work, observing aspects of age and representations of aging and being old in every day experiences forms, is juxtaposed against close critical readings of classical works in social gerontology and current research literature as well as viewings of film and readings of popular literature as the basis for student analysis. Student participation in the seminar demands careful scrutiny and critical synthesis of disparate intellectual, cultural, and social perspectives using readings and field work and creation of oral and written arguments that extend understandings of the issues at hand in new and substantive ways. Emphasis is placed on analysis of field work and literature through a series of media reports and a final term paper. \n\nCreative approaches to identifying literature, analyzing field work and representing critique are encouraged. This course satisfies the Society & Social Structures Sector for Nursing Class of 2012 and Beyond. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "\"SWEET OLD LADIES &: SANDWICHED DAUGHTERS\": SOCIAL IMAGES & ISSUES IN OUR AGING SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8114/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "\"SWEET OLD LADIES &: SANDWICHED DAUGHTERS\": SOCIAL IMAGES & ISSUES IN OUR AGING SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-338-401", "path": "/courses/8114/sections/401", "id": "8114-401", "aliases": ["NURS-338-401", "NURS-838-401", "NURS-638-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/8114/sections/401/reviews/876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN", "first_name": "SARAH HOPE", "last_name": "KAGAN", "id": "876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN", "name": "SARAH HOPE KAGAN"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "8114-401-876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-338", "path": "/courses/8114", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8114/sections", "values": [{"name": "\"SWEET OLD LADIES &: SANDWICHED DAUGHTERS\": SOCIAL IMAGES & ISSUES IN OUR AGING SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-338-401", "path": "/courses/8114/sections/401", "id": "8114-401", "aliases": ["NURS-338-401", "NURS-838-401", "NURS-638-401"]}]}, "id": 8114, "aliases": ["NURS-338", "NURS-838", "NURS-638"]}
