{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/818"}, "description": "This course examines changing ideas about the nature of health and illness; changing forms of health care delivery; changing experiences of women as providers and patients; changing role expectations and realities for nurses; changing midwifery practice; and changing segmentation of the health care labor market by gender, class and race. It takes a gender perspective on all topics considered in the course. A comparative approach is used as national and international literature is considered. This focus is presented as one way of understanding the complex interrelationships among gender, class, and race in health care systems of the United States and countries abroad. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "NURSING&GENDERING OF HEALTH CARE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, 1860-2000", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22174/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82", "rReadingsValue": "3.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.08", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "NURSING&GENDERING OF HEALTH CARE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, 1860-2000", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-518-401", "path": "/courses/22174/sections/401", "id": "22174-401", "aliases": ["NURS-518-401", "GSOC-518-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/22174/sections/401/reviews/3857-BARBRA-MANN-WALL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3857-BARBRA-MANN-WALL", "first_name": "BARBRA MANN", "last_name": "WALL", "id": "3857-BARBRA-MANN-WALL", "name": "BARBRA MANN WALL"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "22174-401-3857-BARBRA-MANN-WALL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-518", "path": "/courses/22174", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22174/sections", "values": [{"name": "NURSING&GENDERING OF HEALTH CARE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, 1860-2000", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-518-401", "path": "/courses/22174/sections/401", "id": "22174-401", "aliases": ["NURS-518-401", "GSOC-518-401"]}]}, "id": 22174, "aliases": ["NURS-518", "GSOC-518"]}
