{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2317"}, "description": "This course introduces students to a relatively new field of inquiry, the history of sexuality in the U.S. It explores the past to consider why sexuality has been so central to American identities, culture, and politics. Primary documents and other readings focus on the history of sexual ideology and regulation; popular culture and changing sexual practices; the emergence of distinct sexual identities and communities; the politics of sexuality; and the relationship between sexual and and other forms of social difference, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, and class. Topics include many with continuing relevance to contemporary public debate: among them, sexual representation and censorship, sexual violence, adolescent sexuality, the politics of reproduction, gay and lesbian sexualities and sexually transmitted diseases. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "HIST OF SEXUALITY IN US", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30463/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.39", "rTAQuality": "3.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.32"}, "section": {"name": "HIST OF SEXUALITY IN US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-349-401", "path": "/courses/30463/sections/401", "id": "30463-401", "aliases": ["HIST-349-401", "GSWS-349-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 50, "path": "/courses/30463/sections/401/reviews/650-KATHY-PEISS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/650-KATHY-PEISS", "first_name": "KATHY", "last_name": "PEISS", "id": "650-KATHY-PEISS", "name": "KATHY PEISS"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "30463-401-650-KATHY-PEISS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-349", "path": "/courses/30463", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30463/sections", "values": [{"name": "HIST OF SEXUALITY IN US", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-349-401", "path": "/courses/30463/sections/401", "id": "30463-401", "aliases": ["HIST-349-401", "GSWS-349-401"]}]}, "id": 30463, "aliases": ["HIST-349", "GSWS-349"]}
