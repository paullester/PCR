{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3943"}, "description": "Drawing upon theoretical and empirical evidence, the course uses a socio-medical approach for understanding the health status and health behaviors of women in South Asia. Gender is a crucial explanatory variable of women's survival experience; burden of disease; nutritional status; and access to and utilization of health services. Girls and women face health and disease problems over their life course related to nutrition needs, reproductive health, work conditions, as well as to infectious disease. This course places the experience of women's health in South Asia in contemporary, historic, and comparative frameworks. Lectures, discussion, and assignments provide entry to greater understanding of both the specialized nature of South Asian women's health problems, as well as those common to women worldwide. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "WOMEN & HEALTH IN S.ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13867/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.42", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "2.08", "rRecommendMajor": "2.58", "rCourseQuality": "2.42", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN & HEALTH IN S.ASIA", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "SAST-286-601", "path": "/courses/13867/sections/601", "id": "13867-601", "aliases": ["SAST-286-601", "GSOC-108-601", "HSOC-109-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/13867/sections/601/reviews/4099-DIVYA-N--ROY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4099-DIVYA-N--ROY", "first_name": "DIVYA N.", "last_name": "ROY", "id": "4099-DIVYA-N--ROY", "name": "DIVYA N.
