{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3884"}, "description": "This course examines the impact of sex and gender roles on contemporary American society. Differentiation by sex is the central organizing principle of nearly every human society. How can we understand the relationship between biological sex and socially constructed gender? How do maleness and femaleness affect the balance of power and resources in our society? How much has changed since the beginning of the Women's Movement of the 1960's? The course will examine key issues of gender difference and inequality including family life, paid work, economic status, violence, body image, sexuality, and reproduction. The course will examine men's roles and women's roles, treating gender as an interactive and dynamic concept. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "GENDER & SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21811/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "3.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.84", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "GENDER & SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GSOC-002-001", "path": "/courses/21811/sections/001", "id": "21811-001", "aliases": ["GSOC-002-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 55, "path": "/courses/21811/sections/001/reviews/3206-SHANNON-B--LUNDEEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3206-SHANNON-B--LUNDEEN", "first_name": "SHANNON B.", "last_name": "LUNDEEN", "id": "3206-SHANNON-B--LUNDEEN", "name": "SHANNON B.
