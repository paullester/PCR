{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4049"}, "description": "This course covers a broad range of feminist writers, from the pioneer thinkers of the 18th century to current feminists who focus on globalization. After examining how and why feminist thought developed, we will explore how different feminists perspectives explain gender inequality both in the US and in contemporary global contexts. Readings will also focus on how gender issues interact with race, ethnity, sexuality, and social class. We will also focus on how feminist theory informs current social movements for gender equality. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "CONTEMP FEMINIST THOUGHT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15855/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEMP FEMINIST THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "GSOC-320-601", "path": "/courses/15855/sections/601", "id": "15855-601", "aliases": ["GSOC-320-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/15855/sections/601/reviews/4359-EMANUELA-BIANCHI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4359-EMANUELA-BIANCHI", "first_name": "EMANUELA", "last_name": "BIANCHI", "id": "4359-EMANUELA-BIANCHI", "name": "EMANUELA BIANCHI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "15855-601-4359-EMANUELA-BIANCHI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSOC-320", "path": "/courses/15855", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15855/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEMP FEMINIST THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "GSOC-320-601", "path": "/courses/15855/sections/601", "id": "15855-601", "aliases": ["GSOC-320-601"]}]}, "id": 15855, "aliases": ["GSOC-320"]}
