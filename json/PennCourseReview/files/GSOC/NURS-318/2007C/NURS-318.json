{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3473"}, "description": "This multidisciplinary course surveys the history of American health care through the multiple perspectives of race, gender, and class, and grounds the discussions in contemporary health issues. It emphasizes the links between the past and present, using not only primary documents but materials from disciplines such as literature, art, sociology, and feminist studies that relate both closely and tangentially to the health professions and health care issues. Discussions will surround gender, class-based, ethnic, and racial ideas about the construction of disease, health and illness; the development of health care institutions; the interplay between religion and science; the experiences of patients and providers; and the response to disasters and epidemics. \n\nSkills for document analysis and critique are built into the course as is the contextual foundation for understanding the history of health care. This course satisfies both the Society & Social Structures and the Histories & Traditions sectors for the Nursing Class of 2012 and beyond. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "RACE, GENDER, CLASS AND THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN HEALTH CARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13644/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.79", "rCommAbility": "3.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "RACE, GENDER, CLASS AND THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN HEALTH CARE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-318-401", "path": "/courses/13644/sections/401", "id": "13644-401", "aliases": ["NURS-318-401", "HSOC-341-401", "GSOC-318-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/13644/sections/401/reviews/869-JULIE-A--FAIRMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/869-JULIE-A--FAIRMAN", "first_name": "JULIE A.", "last_name": "FAIRMAN", "id": "869-JULIE-A--FAIRMAN", "name": "JULIE A.
