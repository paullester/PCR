{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4556"}, "description": "This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analyses of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques, their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer. Estimation and inference procedures are formally analyzed for simple econometric models and illustrated by empirical case studies using real-life data. The course covers linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Estimation and Inference is conducted using least squares and likelihood based techniques. Students are required to perform several econometric analyses of their own. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ECONOMETRICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24269/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.59", "rDifficulty": "3.15", "rStimulateInterest": "1.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.53", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "ECONOMETRICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-104-001", "path": "/courses/24269/sections/001", "id": "24269-001", "aliases": ["ECON-104-001"]}, "comments": "Economics introduces students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision-making. This course teaches students how to analyze economic data, how to approach economic models with probabilistic tools, how to use econometric techniques, and how to apply these techniques through computer software. Students will become familiar with linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Students will perform several economic analyses on their own throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nMany students found the material for this course \u201ctedious\u201d and \u201cdull.\u201d Several students considered the problem sets difficult, but generally found the material to be well presented.\r\n\r\nMost student spoke highly of Professor Cheng, citing an ability to \u201cengage the class\u201d and \u201creview concepts at every chance.\u201d Many students also praised Professor Cheng for being \u201cquick to respond to e-mails\u201d and \u201cvery willing to answer students\u2019 questions during class.\u201d Overall, Professor Cheng comes very highly regarded. \r\n\r\nMost students in this course were Economics majors. Many students were concerned that the problem sets and exams were challenging, but found Professor Cheng\u2019s presentation of the material to be adequate preparation. The course was not recommended to non-majors. The prerequisites are ECON 101, ECON 103, and MATH 114.
