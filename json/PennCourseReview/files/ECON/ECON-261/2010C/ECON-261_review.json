This course studies selected topics on developing economies related to models of growth and development, inequalities and poverty, population, human resources, the international sector and markets, institutions and policies.\r\n\r\nOverall, many students did not enjoy the course content. Most students described it as \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d. It consisted mostly of comparisons between statistics of different developing countries. However, some students did comment that they enjoyed the assigned projects. \r\n\r\nDespite the unpopular content material, Professor Behrman did receive several good comments. Students described him as \u201cnice and accessible\u201d and \u201cintelligent and caring,\u201d especially during the coffee hours he sets up for students to ask questions. He is passionate about the subject matter; however, his slides are quite dry and boring. \r\n\r\nThe workload for this class was not popular among the students. The exams were vague and were based on the large amounts of required readings. Most students thought it was difficult to study for the exam because they did not know what to expect and the course was not well organized.\r\n", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/22942/sections/001/reviews/4786-JERE-R-BEHRMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4786-JERE-R-BEHRMAN", "first_name": "JERE R", "last_name": "BEHRMAN", "id": "4786-JERE-R-BEHRMAN", "name": "JERE R BEHRMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "22942-001-4786-JERE-R-BEHRMAN"}]
