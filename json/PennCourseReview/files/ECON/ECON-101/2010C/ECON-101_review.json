It is a very \"math-heavy\" course with a lot of emphasis on algebra and calculus. One student said, \"The course was way too technical and hard to understand for students in Econ 101.\" But some students did find the content \"interesting.\"\r\n\r\nStudents by and large did not praise Professor Hanley\u2019s teaching abilities. One student said, \"Professor Hanley is the nicest, smartest teacher. He clearly knows his stuff. That being said ECON101 is the first econ class where you need to understand calculus applications in economics. Some felt that the professor \u201ccould not relate to people who had only an elementary understanding of the material.\"\r\n\r\nStudents generally found the material in this class to be difficult. The exams were fairly difficult. One student said it was because the students \"were not adequately prepared.\" Also, the problems sets were very difficult and were hard to complete \"without extensive help.\" The prerequisites are ECON 001 and 002; MATH 104 and either MATH 114 or MATH 115. Note: Incoming freshmen with AP or transfer credit for Econ 1 and Econ 2, MUST complete Math 104 and Math 114 or Math 115 before enrolling in Econ 101. Upper classmen must have at least a B+ in Math 104 to take Econ 101 and Math 114 or Math 115 concurrently. Most students took this class as a major requirement.\r\n", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/22923/sections/601/reviews/5606-DOUGLAS-B-HANLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5606-DOUGLAS-B-HANLEY", "first_name": "DOUGLAS B", "last_name": "HANLEY", "id": "5606-DOUGLAS-B-HANLEY", "name": "DOUGLAS B HANLEY"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "22923-601-5606-DOUGLAS-B-HANLEY"}]
