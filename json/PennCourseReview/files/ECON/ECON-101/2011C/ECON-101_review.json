There is a very heavy dependence on the textbook readings and less on real world applications.\r\n\r\nThe general consensus of this class was that the material was interesting, but it was not as well taught as it could have been. Many of the students complained about the tests and their lack of coherence with the rest of the class. Many students found it \u201cfrustrating\u201d that they did not know what was going to appear on the tests, and much of what did appear was not emphasized in class. Students agreed that the take home tests and the communication between TA, Professor and student needed to be a bit more organized. Overall, the main complaint about the course was its lack of structure, not the material or the difficulty level. Some students found that the material overlapped heavily with ECON 001, one of the prerequisites of the class.\r\n\r\nStudents complimented Professor Burdett for being a \u201crespected economist.\u201d However, they did not necessarily see him as highly engaging, available or a helpful professor. Though he was reported to often go off on witty, yet irrelevant, tangents, Professor Burdett often received a lackluster review. He did not respond promptly to emails and often mumbled so students had trouble hearing. In addition, the tests were graded slowly. Professor Burdett didn\u2019t often use slides, which contributed to the feel of disorganization. On the other hand, it is clear to students that Professor Burdett is incredibly intelligent and \u201cclearly passionate about economics.\u201d   \r\n \r\nThis class is a \u201ctoolkit course.\u201d It is mainly recommended for Economics majors or minors and provides a great deal of theory that can be useful later in studies. The workload consisted of five exams, both in class and take home. The prerequisites are ECON 001, ECON 002 and MATH 114.\r\n", "num_students": 156, "path": "/courses/24266/sections/001/reviews/1365-KENNETH-BURDETT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1365-KENNETH-BURDETT", "first_name": "KENNETH", "last_name": "BURDETT", "id": "1365-KENNETH-BURDETT", "name": "KENNETH BURDETT"}, "num_reviewers": 132, "id": "24266-001-1365-KENNETH-BURDETT"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "3.36", "rStimulateInterest": "1.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "1.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "1.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.07"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMED MICROECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-101-601", "path": "/courses/24266/sections/601", "id": "24266-601", "aliases": ["ECON-101-601"]}, "comments": "Economics 101 takes an in-depth look at microeconomic concepts.
