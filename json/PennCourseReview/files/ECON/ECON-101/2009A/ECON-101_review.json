Students felt that the book was useless as the professor barely utilized it. Students didn\u2019t know what to expect from the class as there was no syllabus, no assigned readings and only three homework assignments.

Some felt the course was highly informative and that they had a solid grasp of the fundamentals of microeconomics when the semester was over. They felt that the course was more or less straightforward. Others, however, felt that the material was covered \u201ctoo fast in class, quizzes didn\u2019t match what was done in class, and student interest wasn\u2019t stimulated in any real way.\u201d Another student yearned to learn more about the real applications to the current economy.\r\n\r\n&#8232;Students felt that Professor Li genuinely cared about their feedback and tried to improve the course throughout the semester based on their comments. One student said, \u201cProfessor Li honestly cares for her students. She cares about what we think and tries her best to make sure that her students are learning.\u201d Although some found that her teaching style could use some improvement, especially when explaining tricky mathematical problem sets, it is clear that these students were reassured by Professor Li\u2019s desire to tailor her teaching to student needs. The multiple mid-semester evaluations that Professor Li gave out ensured that she would listen and improve the course while the students were still in it, not after the fact.\r\n\r\nEconomics 101 is a required course for the Economics major and is a prerequisite for all 200 level courses.
