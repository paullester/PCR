It studies how household decision-making and government politics and interventions determine macroeconomic aggregates. There will be an emphasis on developing and applying economic models. &#8232;Course content was based on popular macroeconomic models and related papers in order to teach students how to use numerical methods to solve macroeconomic problems.\r\nStudents commented that concepts, models, and papers presented in class are \u201cfascinating.\u201d They \u201clearned a lot\u201d in this \u201cgreat course.\u201d However, the course\u2019s emphasis on Matlab (a programming language that is not taught in the class) made assignments \u201ctough\u201d for those who were unfamiliar with it, because programming comprised much of the exams. Those who did have experience programming found the use of Matlab in an economic context \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cvaluable,\u201d citing assignments as \u201cdifficult,\u201d but \u201crewarding.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents described Professor Greenwood as \u201ca genius\u201d and \u201can excellent professor.\u201d He made the content \u201cincredibly interesting\u201d and was \u201cvery open to discussing the material both inside and outside of the classroom.\u201d Some felt that he did not present enough specific examples of the material, but rather explained it all in theory. Students were troubled by his refusal to answer questions during the exam period, as well as his failure to return exams or distribute solutions, which made it difficult to learn from past errors and improve.\r\nThis course is recommended to students considering graduate studies in economics, as evidenced from the prerequisites. This course is difficult and \u201cnot for the faint of heart.\u201d Exams took many students \u201cover 20 hours each.\u201d The amount of work required and previous knowledge of Matlab were described as \u201ctoo much,\u201d leading students to claim it \u201cshould be a 300-level class or honor\u2019s thesis\u201d rather than 200-level. Matlab programming language created a \u201cconsiderable obstacle for students with no background in computer programming.\u201d This led to a skewed grade distribution, with a \u201cdisparity between grades of those who can program and those who can\u2019t.\u201d", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/15596/sections/001/reviews/4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "GREENWOOD", "id": "4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD", "name": "JEREMY GREENWOOD"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "15596-001-4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD"}]
