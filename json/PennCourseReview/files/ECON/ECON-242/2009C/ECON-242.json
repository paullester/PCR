Applications to labor markets, monetary economics, the marriage market will be discused. The main technical tool will be search theory, but a liberal amount of calculus and other mathematics will be used. \n\nNumerical Methods for Macroeconmists. This course will study some of the numerical methods that are used in modern macroeconomics. This class will learn how to solve nonlinear equations, difference equations, interpolate functions, smooth data, and conduct Monte Carlo simulations on the computer. This will be done while studying economic problems, such as the determination of labor supply, economic growth and business cycle analysis. Calculus is an integral part of the course and some elementary probability theory will be drawn upon. The MATLAB programming language will be used. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "TOPICS IN ECON GROWTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17218/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.83", "rDifficulty": "3.10", "rStimulateInterest": "1.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.07", "rCourseQuality": "1.55", "rWorkRequired": "1.96", "rInstructorAccess": "2.10", "rReadingsValue": "1.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.67", "rCommAbility": "1.90", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN ECON GROWTH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-242-001", "path": "/courses/17218/sections/001", "id": "17218-001", "aliases": ["ECON-242-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/17218/sections/001/reviews/4782-MOSHE-HAZAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4782-MOSHE-HAZAN", "first_name": "MOSHE", "last_name": "HAZAN", "id": "4782-MOSHE-HAZAN", "name": "MOSHE HAZAN"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "17218-001-4782-MOSHE-HAZAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-242", "path": "/courses/17218", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17218/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN ECON GROWTH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-242-001", "path": "/courses/17218/sections/001", "id": "17218-001", "aliases": ["ECON-242-001"]}]}, "id": 17218, "aliases": ["ECON-242"]}
