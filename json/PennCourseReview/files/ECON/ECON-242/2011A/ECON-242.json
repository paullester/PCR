{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2517"}, "description": "This course covers topics of interest in macroeconomics. Two sections are offered: Markets with Frictions. This course studies allocations in markets with frictions, as described by the difficulty in finding a trading partner, private information problems, commitment issues, and so on. Applications to labor markets, monetary economics, the marriage market will be discused. The main technical tool will be search theory, but a liberal amount of calculus and other mathematics will be used. \n\nNumerical Methods for Macroeconmists. This course will study some of the numerical methods that are used in modern macroeconomics. This class will learn how to solve nonlinear equations, difference equations, interpolate functions, smooth data, and conduct Monte Carlo simulations on the computer. This will be done while studying economic problems, such as the determination of labor supply, economic growth and business cycle analysis. Calculus is an integral part of the course and some elementary probability theory will be drawn upon. The MATLAB programming language will be used. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "NUM.

However the slides were poorly constructed. The tests come directly from the textbook, which was described as very helpful and educational. &#8232;&#8232;Students described Professor Ozmucur as very \u201cknowledgeable\u201d regarding course material, and extremely approachable and willing to talk to students outside of class. However one student regretted that he simply taught straight from the slides, which come from the textbook. &#8232;&#8232;Prerequisites are Economics 101 and 102.
