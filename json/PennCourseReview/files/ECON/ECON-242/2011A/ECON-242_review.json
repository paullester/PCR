The tests come directly from the textbook, which was described as very helpful and educational. &#8232;&#8232;Students described Professor Ozmucur as very \u201cknowledgeable\u201d regarding course material, and extremely approachable and willing to talk to students outside of class. However one student regretted that he simply taught straight from the slides, which come from the textbook. &#8232;&#8232;Prerequisites are Economics 101 and 102.
