By recognizing the importance of scarcity and incentives this course focuses on the critical economic issues in producing, delivering and financing health care. In particular, the course analyzes determinants of demand for medical care, such as health status, insurance coverage, and income; the unique role of physicians in guiding and shaping the allocation of resources in medical care markets; and competition in medical care markets, especially among hospitals. Special emphasis is placed on the evaluation of policy instruments such as government regulation, antitrust laws, 'sin taxes' on cigarettes and alcohol, and public health programs. The course uses more advanced quantitative methods and formal economic theory.\r\n\r\nStudents thought the course was \u201cvery interesting,\u201d and a few even described it as one of the best courses they had taken.  Several students noted that they \u201clearned a great deal about all aspects of healthcare.\u201d A few particularly liked the \u201cstructure of the class [which] allowed [them] to focus on learning the information\u201d without being \u201cbogged down\u201d in work.  While a couple students enjoyed the guest lecturers, others noted that the professor was a superior lecturer.\r\n\r\nStudents universally praised the \u201cfantastic\u201d Professor David.  They felt he was a \u201cgreat lecturer\u201d and particularly appreciated his \u201cgreat sense of humor\u201d and \u201cability to stimulate interest in students.\u201d  They felt that he was both \u201cincredibly approachable\u201d and \u201ca leader in the field of health economics.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few students noted that the course required \u201cminimal work\u201d outside of class as there was not any required reading.  However, there were three homework assignments that \u201ctook around 4 hours each to complete\u201d and one that \u201ctook around 10 hours\u201d according to one student. A couple students mentioned that the homework was either \u201cconfusing\u201d or \u201cpoorly structured.\u201d  A few others noted that the class required \u201cstraight memorization of the slides,\u201d but one noted appreciatively that the midterm \u201ccan only help [a student\u2019s] final grade.\u201d  ECON 1 & ECON 2 OR BPUB 250 is required as a prerequisite, and it is recommended that students have knowledge of calculus and basic microeconomics.  Students who take this course cannot also take HCMG 202 (ECON 039) for further credit.\r\n", "num_students": 104, "path": "/courses/27532/sections/401/reviews/2995-GUY-DAVID", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2995-GUY-DAVID", "first_name": "GUY", "last_name": "DAVID", "id": "2995-GUY-DAVID", "name": "GUY DAVID"}, "num_reviewers": 99, "id": "27532-401-2995-GUY-DAVID"}]
