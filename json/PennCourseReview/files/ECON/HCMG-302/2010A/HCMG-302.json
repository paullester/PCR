{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3101"}, "description": "This course provides an application of economic principles to the health care sector. By recognizing the importance of scarcity and incentives, this course will focus on the critical economic issues in producing, delivering, and financing health care. In particular, the course will analyze determinants of demand for medical care, such as health status, insurance coverage, and income; the unique role of physicians in guiding and shaping the allocation of resources in medical care markets; and competition in medical care markets, especially among hospitals. Special emphasis will be placed on the evaluation of policy instruments such as government regulation, antitrust laws, 'sin taxes' on cigarettes and alcohol, and public health programs. This course is similar to HCMG 202, but uses more advanced quantitative methods and formal economic theory; knowledge of calculus and basic microeconomics is recommended. Students who take HCMG 302 (ECON 236) may not also take HCMG 202 (ECON 039) for further credit. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ECON & FIN HLTH CARE DEL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26157/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.41", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "2.51", "rReadingsValue": "1.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.14", "rCommAbility": "2.95", "rInstructorQuality": "2.96"}, "section": {"name": "ECON & FIN HLTH CARE DEL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-302-401", "path": "/courses/26157/sections/401", "id": "26157-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-302-401", "ECON-236-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 139, "path": "/courses/26157/sections/401/reviews/2995-GUY-DAVID", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2995-GUY-DAVID", "first_name": "GUY", "last_name": "DAVID", "id": "2995-GUY-DAVID", "name": "GUY DAVID"}, "num_reviewers": 135, "id": "26157-401-2995-GUY-DAVID"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HCMG-302", "path": "/courses/26157", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26157/sections", "values": [{"name": "ECON & FIN HLTH CARE DEL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-302-401", "path": "/courses/26157/sections/401", "id": "26157-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-302-401", "ECON-236-401"]}]}, "id": 26157, "aliases": ["HCMG-302", "ECON-236"]}
