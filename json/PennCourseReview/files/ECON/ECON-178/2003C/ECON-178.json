{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1272"}, "description": "This is an advanced course in macroeconomics. A relatively simple, but well defined and internally consistent model of the U.S. economy is set up and used to study how output is generated given the initial resources, how output is divided between consumption and addition to capital stock, and how this process accumulates over time. The role of prices including the rate of interest in this process is also reviewed. Finally, some reasons why such a process does not necessarily result in efficient results with full employment of resources are reviewed, and monetary and fiscal policies needed to improve the performance of the economy under such circumstances are discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MONETARY & FIS.
