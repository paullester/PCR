Topics include property rights and intellectual property, analysis of antitrust, and economic analysis of legal decision making.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course to be a good introduction to law in economics. One student called it \"one of the better economics courses taken at Penn.\u201d However, the material covered was straight from the textbook and the lectures were not comprehensive. One student said that attending lecture itself was not necessary as \u201cI was better served reading the textbook on my own.\u201d Others disagreed saying it was \u201can extremely valuable class.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Shachmurove received mixed reviews. Some say he spent too much time on non-course related topics and that that he could not \"explain concepts well.\u201d However, many said the professor provided consistent emails informing students what they should read and study showing a \u201cgenuine concern for our own edification.\u201d\r\n\r\nReadings were thought to be too long but the course was highly recommended for Economics minors.
