{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/349"}, "description": "This course is in the format of a seminar. It will begin with a brief description of the socialist system of central planning, its strengths and weakenesses, early attempts at reform, and the reasons for abandoning planning and moving to a market system. This will be followed by an investigation of the theoretical aspects of the transition from the institutional arrangements of socialism to those of a capitalist market system. In the final part of the course, the transition experience of socialist economies will be analyzed with major attention to such issues as price liberalization, macro stabilization, privatization, banking and finance, growth, employment and income, role of foreign sector, legal structure, organized crime, and shock therapy vs. gradualism. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "TRANS SOCIAL TO MKT ECON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2836/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.68", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "2.32", "rRecommendMajor": "2.85", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.84", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "TRANS SOCIAL TO MKT ECON", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-164-001", "path": "/courses/2836/sections/001", "id": "2836-001", "aliases": ["ECON-164-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/2836/sections/001/reviews/341-HERBERT-S-LEVINE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/341-HERBERT-S-LEVINE", "first_name": "HERBERT S", "last_name": "LEVINE", "id": "341-HERBERT-S-LEVINE", "name": "HERBERT S LEVINE"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "2836-001-341-HERBERT-S-LEVINE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-164", "path": "/courses/2836", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2836/sections", "values": [{"name": "TRANS SOCIAL TO MKT ECON", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-164-001", "path": "/courses/2836/sections/001", "id": "2836-001", "aliases": ["ECON-164-001"]}]}, "id": 2836, "aliases": ["ECON-164"]}
