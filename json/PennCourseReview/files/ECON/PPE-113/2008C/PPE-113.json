{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4749"}, "description": "This course is about strategically interdependent decisions. In such situations, the outcome of your actions depends also on the actions of others. When making your choice, you have to think what the others will choose, who in turn are thinking what you will be choosing, and so on. Game Theory offers several concepts and insights for understanding such situations, and for making better strategic choices. This course will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory, using illustrations, applications, and cases drawn from business, economics, politics, sports, and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory, and the only pre-requisite is some high-school algebra. This course will also be accepted by the Economics department as an Econ course, to be counted toward the minor in Economics (or as an Econ elective). \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "STRATEGIC REASONING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19180/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.52", "rDifficulty": "3.02", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rRecommendMajor": "2.52", "rCourseQuality": "2.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC REASONING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PPE-113-401", "path": "/courses/19180/sections/401", "id": "19180-401", "aliases": ["PPE-113-401", "ECON-013-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 69, "path": "/courses/19180/sections/401/reviews/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "DILLENBERGER", "id": "4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "name": "DAVID DILLENBERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "19180-401-4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PPE-113", "path": "/courses/19180", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19180/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC REASONING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PPE-113-401", "path": "/courses/19180/sections/401", "id": "19180-401", "aliases": ["PPE-113-401", "ECON-013-401"]}]}, "id": 19180, "aliases": ["PPE-113", "ECON-013"]}
