Students will be introduced to the workhorse theoretical models that are used to understand growth by modern macroeconomic researchers and policy makers. This course addresses a variety of questions about the economic growth of countries and builds theoretical models that can be used to answer these questions. There will be a strong focus on emphasizing the microeconomic foundations of models, and using the language of mathematics to express the underlying assumptions and assess their implications for policy, and on comparing the predictions of our models with the data.\r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201cone of the best at Penn\u201d with \u201ca great mix of theory and empirical applications.\u201d Students found the concepts interesting and somewhat challenging.\r\n\r\nMany students called Professor Kaplan \u201cone of the best economics teachers at Penn.\u201d He is described as \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201centhusiastic about explaining the material.\u201d Students found him \u201cknowledgeable\u201d and \u201caccessible.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe prerequisites for this course are: Econ 101, Econ 102, Math 104, and Math 114 or Math 115.
