{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5110"}, "description": "This is an advanced undergraduate course in models of economic growth. Students will be introduced to the workhorse theoretical models that are used to understand growth by modern macroeconomic researchers and policy makers. The types of questions that we will address include: Why are some countries richer than others? Why do some countries grow quickly while others stagnate? Why did modern economic growth start in Western Europe? What can governments do to accelerate economic growth? How does economic growth interact with demographic and geographic factors? We will build theoretical models that can be used to answer these questions. There will be a strong focus on emphasizing the microeconomic foundations of models, and using the language of mathematics to express the underlying assumptions and assess their implications for policy. Hence, there are strict mathematical prerequisites. We will also compare the predictions of our models with the data. Thus, a fair amount of econometrics will be required. A class in statistics and econometrics is highly recommended. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MACRO-MODELING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30173/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.52", "rTAQuality": "2.89", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.05", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "MACRO-MODELING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-244-001", "path": "/courses/30173/sections/001", "id": "30173-001", "aliases": ["ECON-244-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/30173/sections/001/reviews/6485-GUILLERMO-ORDONEZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6485-GUILLERMO-ORDONEZ", "first_name": "GUILLERMO", "last_name": "ORDONEZ", "id": "6485-GUILLERMO-ORDONEZ", "name": "GUILLERMO ORDONEZ"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "30173-001-6485-GUILLERMO-ORDONEZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-244", "path": "/courses/30173", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30173/sections", "values": [{"name": "MACRO-MODELING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-244-001", "path": "/courses/30173/sections/001", "id": "30173-001", "aliases": ["ECON-244-001"]}]}, "id": 30173, "aliases": ["ECON-244"]}
