{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3053"}, "description": "This course will use economic tools to explore decision making and allocation of resources within the family. The course will use both economic theory and econometric evidence to investigate these issues. The impact of gender roles and differences will be examined and the effect of these differences on economic decisions and outcomes both within and outside the family will be discussed. \n\nStudent participation will be an integral part of the course. During class, students will be required to evaluate data and relate it to the theoretic model covered. Student participation will also include two in-class oral presentations. Students will be working with CWiC (Communication Within the Curriculum) as they work on these presentations. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ECONOMICS OF FAMILY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22927/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.84", "rStimulateInterest": "1.73", "rRecommendMajor": "2.56", "rCourseQuality": "1.91", "rWorkRequired": "1.85", "rInstructorAccess": "2.31", "rReadingsValue": "1.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.15", "rCommAbility": "2.04", "rInstructorQuality": "2.20"}, "section": {"name": "ECONOMICS OF FAMILY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-210-001", "path": "/courses/22927/sections/001", "id": "22927-001", "aliases": ["ECON-210-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/22927/sections/001/reviews/4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "GREENWOOD", "id": "4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD", "name": "JEREMY GREENWOOD"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "22927-001-4300-JEREMY-GREENWOOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-210", "path": "/courses/22927", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22927/sections", "values": [{"name": "ECONOMICS OF FAMILY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-210-001", "path": "/courses/22927/sections/001", "id": "22927-001", "aliases": ["ECON-210-001"]}]}, "id": 22927, "aliases": ["ECON-210"]}
