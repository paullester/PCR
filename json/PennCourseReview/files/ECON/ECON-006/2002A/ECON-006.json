{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/334"}, "description": "This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision making. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analyses of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques, their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer. \n\nThe course focuses on practical and conceptual issues involved in the substantive applications of econometric techniques. Estimation and inference procedures are formally analyzed for simple econometric models and illustrated by empirical case studies using real-life data. The course covers linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Estimation and Inference is conducted using least squares and likelihood based techniques. Students are required to perform several econometric analyses of their own. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "ECONOMETRICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/334/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.96", "rDifficulty": "3.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "1.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.15", "rCommAbility": "2.96", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "ECONOMETRICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-006-001", "path": "/courses/334/sections/001", "id": "334-001", "aliases": ["ECON-006-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/334/sections/001/reviews/332-GREGORY-KORDAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/332-GREGORY-KORDAS", "first_name": "GREGORY", "last_name": "KORDAS", "id": "332-GREGORY-KORDAS", "name": "GREGORY KORDAS"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "334-001-332-GREGORY-KORDAS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.58", "rDifficulty": "3.42", "rStimulateInterest": "1.84", "rRecommendMajor": "2.58", "rCourseQuality": "2.26", "rWorkRequired": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.37", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.74", "rCommAbility": "2.05", "rInstructorQuality": "2.37"}, "section": {"name": "ECONOMETRICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-006-002", "path": "/courses/334/sections/002", "id": "334-002", "aliases": ["ECON-006-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/334/sections/002/reviews/333-BAS-VAN-DER-KLAAUW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/333-BAS-VAN-DER-KLAAUW", "first_name": "BAS", "last_name": "VAN DER KLAAUW", "id": "333-BAS-VAN-DER-KLAAUW", "name": "BAS VAN DER KLAAUW"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "334-002-333-BAS-VAN-DER-KLAAUW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-006", "path": "/courses/334", "sections": {"path": "/courses/334/sections", "values": [{"name": "ECONOMETRICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-006-001", "path": "/courses/334/sections/001", "id": "334-001", "aliases": ["ECON-006-001"]}, {"name": "ECONOMETRICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-006-002", "path": "/courses/334/sections/002", "id": "334-002", "aliases": ["ECON-006-002"]}]}, "id": 334, "aliases": ["ECON-006"]}
