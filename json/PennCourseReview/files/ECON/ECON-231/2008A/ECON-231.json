What a real college class should be.\u201d Several students mentioned that it was unlike any other economics course they had taken: \u201cIt was the first time I had to write a paper for an Economics class,\u201d said one student. Another mentioned, \u201cI found the course very informative and less abstract than many other Econ classes.\u201d Despite the unique way the material was presented, some students claimed that there was virtually no new material covered that wasn\u2019t learned in Econ101 and 102, saying that \u201cat times it felt like a repeat of previous classes.\u201d \r\n\t\r\nStudents loved Professor Eekhout. Many mentioned that they \u201cenjoyed the professor\u2019s anecdotes and connections to the real world.\u201d  Students commented that they \u201cwere never bored in class,\u201d and that \u201cit was so refreshing to have a professor who is so passionate and stimulating.\u201d\r\n\t\r\nStudents felt the material discussed in class did not always correlate to the exam questions.  The class was mostly Economics majors since ECON 101, MATH 104 and MATH 114 or MATH 115 are prerequisites to taking this class. Also, ECON 103 is recommended and credit cannot be received for both ECON 030 and 231.", "num_students": 110, "path": "/courses/20023/sections/001/reviews/1369-JAN-EECKHOUT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1369-JAN-EECKHOUT", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "EECKHOUT", "id": "1369-JAN-EECKHOUT", "name": "JAN EECKHOUT"}, "num_reviewers": 75, "id": "20023-001-1369-JAN-EECKHOUT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-231", "path": "/courses/20023", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20023/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-231-001", "path": "/courses/20023/sections/001", "id": "20023-001", "aliases": ["ECON-231-001"]}]}, "id": 20023, "aliases": ["ECON-231"]}
