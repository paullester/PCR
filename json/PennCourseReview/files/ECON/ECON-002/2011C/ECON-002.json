Many students described the course as \"very helpful\" for understanding the current state of the economy.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Bossi as \"very interesting\" and \"charismatic.\" \"Always fun\" and \"engaging,\" Professor Bossi made class entertaining and conveyed the course material clearly.\r\n\r\nStudents found the exams for this course to be \"surprisingly difficult\" and much harder than the practice problems. One student warned that \"the make-up midterms are generally harder than the original ones.\" However, the overall coursework was not extensive. There was one online assignment per week, which one student described as \"manageable to finish within 1 to 2 hours.\"\r\n", "num_students": 104, "path": "/courses/24262/sections/001/reviews/5337-LUCA-BOSSI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5337-LUCA-BOSSI", "first_name": "LUCA", "last_name": "BOSSI", "id": "5337-LUCA-BOSSI", "name": "LUCA BOSSI"}, "num_reviewers": 91, "id": "24262-001-5337-LUCA-BOSSI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "2.74", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.19", "rCommAbility": "2.64", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO MACRO", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-002-002", "path": "/courses/24262/sections/002", "id": "24262-002", "aliases": ["ECON-002-002"]}, "comments": "Economics 002 is an introduction to economic analysis and its application. The course focuses on the market economy, attempting to explain the factors that contribute to the size and composition of national output. It touches on monetary and fiscal policy, international trade, economic development, and comparative economic systems.  \r\n\r\nStudents in general found the subject a bit dry. The exams were challenging and the lack of a curve frustrated some students. Indeed, one student felt he would not get an A in the class, despite doing better than most other students.  \r\n\r\nProfessor Bossi, according to most students, enlivened the course material. Most found his injection of humor refreshing. One went so far as to attribute his decision to major in Economics to Professor Bossi\u2019s teaching. A few students complained that he simply regurgitates the readings, but overall the feedback was positive.  \r\n\r\nMost students in the course were freshmen. The only prerequisite is ECON001. The exams are challenging, but manageable. Assignments include weekly online work, two midterms, and a final. This course fulfills the Society sector and is the second course required for an Econ major.  \r\n", "num_students": 54, "path": "/courses/24262/sections/002/reviews/5337-LUCA-BOSSI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5337-LUCA-BOSSI", "first_name": "LUCA", "last_name": "BOSSI", "id": "5337-LUCA-BOSSI", "name": "LUCA BOSSI"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "24262-002-5337-LUCA-BOSSI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "3.05", "rStimulateInterest": "2.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "2.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.04"}, "section": {"name": "Introductory Economics: Macro", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-002-601", "path": "/courses/24262/sections/601", "id": "24262-601", "aliases": ["ECON-002-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/24262/sections/601/reviews/5734-FELIPE-E-SAFFIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5734-FELIPE-E-SAFFIE", "first_name": "FELIPE E", "last_name": "SAFFIE", "id": "5734-FELIPE-E-SAFFIE", "name": "FELIPE E SAFFIE"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "24262-601-5734-FELIPE-E-SAFFIE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-002", "path": "/courses/24262", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24262/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO MACRO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-002-001", "path": "/courses/24262/sections/001", "id": "24262-001", "aliases": ["ECON-002-001"]}, {"name": "INTRO TO MACRO", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-002-002", "path": "/courses/24262/sections/002", "id": "24262-002", "aliases": ["ECON-002-002"]}, {"name": "Introductory Economics: Macro", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-002-601", "path": "/courses/24262/sections/601", "id": "24262-601", "aliases": ["ECON-002-601"]}]}, "id": 24262, "aliases": ["ECON-002"]}
