The course covers linear regression models, simultaneous-equations models, discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Estimation and Inference is conducted using least squares and likelihood based techniques. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analysis of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques, their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer.\r\n\r\nThe course was considered very informative and useful. Some students felt that the lectures were \"boring\" and \"dry,\u201d but still very important. However, the pacing was considered a little off as all the complex material was crammed into the end. Some students felt that the problem sets were too difficult to do using lecture materials.\r\n\r\nProfessor Krasnokutskaya was thought to be unapproachable by some students but others thought that she was the \"best econometrics professor\" and was very straightforward and clear.\r\n\r\nThere were 5 problem sets, a project and 3 in-class tests, which according to many students were good as it made them stay on top of their work. Students also liked that there was a real world application of the material. Both the TA and the textbook were considered not very useful to the course.", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/15590/sections/001/reviews/2754-ELENA-KRASNOKUTSKAYA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2754-ELENA-KRASNOKUTSKAYA", "first_name": "ELENA", "last_name": "KRASNOKUTSKAYA", "id": "2754-ELENA-KRASNOKUTSKAYA", "name": "ELENA KRASNOKUTSKAYA"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "15590-001-2754-ELENA-KRASNOKUTSKAYA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "3.18", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.18", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.36"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ECONOMETRICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-220-002", "path": "/courses/15590/sections/002", "id": "15590-002", "aliases": ["ECON-220-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/15590/sections/002/reviews/3261-KYUNGCHUL-SONG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3261-KYUNGCHUL-SONG", "first_name": "KYUNGCHUL", "last_name": "SONG", "id": "3261-KYUNGCHUL-SONG", "name": "KYUNGCHUL SONG"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "15590-002-3261-KYUNGCHUL-SONG"}]
