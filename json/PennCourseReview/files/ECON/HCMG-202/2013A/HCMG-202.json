{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3396"}, "description": "The course provides an application of economic models to demand, supply, and their interaction in the medical economy. Influences on demand, especially health status, insurance coverage, and income will be analyzed. Physician decisions on the pricing and form of their own services, and on the advice they offer about other services, will be considered. Competition in medical care markets, especially for hospital services, will be studied. Special emphasis will be placed on government as demander of medical care services. Changes in Medicare and regulation of managed care are among the public policy issues to be addressed. Students who take HCMG 202 may not also take HCMG 302, ECON 039, or ECON 236 for further credit. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ECON & FINCING-HLTHCR DL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30414/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.04", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rTAQuality": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.82", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.21", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.61", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "ECON & FINCING-HLTHCR DL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-202-401", "path": "/courses/30414/sections/401", "id": "30414-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-202-401", "ECON-039-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/30414/sections/401/reviews/5759-AMANDA-K--STARC", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5759-AMANDA-K--STARC", "first_name": "AMANDA K.", "last_name": "STARC", "id": "5759-AMANDA-K--STARC", "name": "AMANDA K.
