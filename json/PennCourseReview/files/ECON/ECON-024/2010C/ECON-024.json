The general aim is to show how economic analysis has been applied to issues related to developing countries. Among the topics covered are: income distribution, poverty, health, population growth, migration, growth, and the rural economy. The prerequisites are Econ 001 or Econ 010.\r\n\r\nStudents reported that this course \u201caddressed important questions\u201d and made them \u201cthink critically.\u201d Some students regretted that although it was a small class, \u201cthere was little to no discussion.\u201d Others were disappointed by a lack of depth, as only one textbook was used and no outside readings were incorporated. Additionally, since the course covers \u201capproximately 15 chapters in one semester,\u201d it was difficult to cover any individual topic in much depth. Several students also expressed a desire for the course to be more structured.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cunha was generally described as a \u201cnice guy\u201d who is \u201cexcellent at conveying the material.\u201d However, students complained about a lack of accessibility and communication with the professor. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in talking about grades or how you\u2019re going to be graded,\u201d and he \u201cdoes not respond promptly or at all\u201d to student emails. Many students also found him to be disorganized. One student noted that the \u201cinstructor is brilliant\u201d but may not realize \u201cthat the class isn\u2019t following along.\u201d A few students commented that the professor follows the book very closely, even using PowerPoint slides from the book. \r\n\r\nThis upper-level economics class was recommended to economics majors. One student recommended this course to \u201canyone seeking to work in International Development\u2026because it demonstrates the difficulty there is in achieving development.\u201d Some students mentioned that assignments did not have much use because they were not returned to students and did not seem to reinforce concepts. Others expressed confusion over the system of grading used on exams.\r\n", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/22920/sections/001/reviews/4784-FLAVIO-CUNHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4784-FLAVIO-CUNHA", "first_name": "FLAVIO", "last_name": "CUNHA", "id": "4784-FLAVIO-CUNHA", "name": "FLAVIO CUNHA"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "22920-001-4784-FLAVIO-CUNHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-024", "path": "/courses/22920", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22920/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-024-001", "path": "/courses/22920/sections/001", "id": "22920-001", "aliases": ["ECON-024-001"]}]}, "id": 22920, "aliases": ["ECON-024"]}
