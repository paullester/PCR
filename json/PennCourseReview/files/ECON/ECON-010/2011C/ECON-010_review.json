The first part concerns microeconomic ideas such as opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, importance of costs and revenues under perfect competition vs. monopoly, externalities, and public goods. The second part focuses on macroeconomic data, two models of the labor market, a model of the aggregate household, and the standard AD-AS model. Finally, there is a brief introduction to fiscal policy, banking, and the role of the Central Bank.\r\n\r\nEvaluations for this course were mixed. Some felt it could have been more rigorous, while others concluded that it actually moved too fast. A background in economics seems to have helped students, as some without such a foundation felt disadvantaged. Students also suggested that combining microeconomics and macroeconomics might not be beneficial or practical. \r\n \r\nReviews of Professor Spiegel also run the gamut. Most students felt that he communicated the material in confusing ways. As one student writes: \u201cProfessor Spiegel had a lot of great information to share with the class, but often it was often hard to follow his thought process and thoroughly understand the material.\u201d The lectures were often dry. A few students thought that the professor held them back from understanding the material.\r\n\r\nThis class is the baseline economics class for Wharton students. It is populated mostly to exclusively by freshmen. It fulfills a Wharton requirement. Sentiments about the workload, as mentioned above, vary.\r\n", "num_students": 237, "path": "/courses/24263/sections/001/reviews/1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "URIEL", "last_name": "SPIEGEL", "id": "1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL", "name": "URIEL SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 229, "id": "24263-001-1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.23", "rDifficulty": "2.79", "rStimulateInterest": "1.56", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "1.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "2.22", "rReadingsValue": "1.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.72", "rCommAbility": "1.44", "rInstructorQuality": "1.70"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ECON FOR BUS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-010-002", "path": "/courses/24263/sections/002", "id": "24263-002", "aliases": ["ECON-010-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 171, "path": "/courses/24263/sections/002/reviews/1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "URIEL", "last_name": "SPIEGEL", "id": "1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL", "name": "URIEL SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 169, "id": "24263-002-1360-URIEL-SPIEGEL"}]
