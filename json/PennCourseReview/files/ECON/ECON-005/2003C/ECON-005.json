{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/333"}, "description": "The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems, but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason, empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course, and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112). (Students with a one semester AP Statistics credit for Stat 101 or higher can drop the credit to take Econ 5 via a release form available from the department). Students who have one semester of statistics take the second course in statistics or Econ 6 (or Econ 5, if Stat 111 was taken) to satisfy the statistics requirement of the major. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3974/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "1.93", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.93", "rCommAbility": "2.53", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-005-001", "path": "/courses/3974/sections/001", "id": "3974-001", "aliases": ["ECON-005-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/3974/sections/001/reviews/2089-SULEYMAN-OZMUCUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2089-SULEYMAN-OZMUCUR", "first_name": "SULEYMAN", "last_name": "OZMUCUR", "id": "2089-SULEYMAN-OZMUCUR", "name": "SULEYMAN OZMUCUR"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "3974-001-2089-SULEYMAN-OZMUCUR"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "1.70", "rStimulateInterest": "2.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "1.43", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "1.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.92", "rCommAbility": "2.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.03"}, "section": {"name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-005-002", "path": "/courses/3974/sections/002", "id": "3974-002", "aliases": ["ECON-005-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 55, "path": "/courses/3974/sections/002/reviews/332-GREGORY-KORDAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/332-GREGORY-KORDAS", "first_name": "GREGORY", "last_name": "KORDAS", "id": "332-GREGORY-KORDAS", "name": "GREGORY KORDAS"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "3974-002-332-GREGORY-KORDAS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-005-601", "path": "/courses/3974/sections/601", "id": "3974-601", "aliases": ["ECON-005-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/3974/sections/601/reviews/1990-LEI-JI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1990-LEI-JI", "first_name": "LEI", "last_name": "JI", "id": "1990-LEI-JI", "name": "LEI JI"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "3974-601-1990-LEI-JI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-005", "path": "/courses/3974", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3974/sections", "values": [{"name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-005-001", "path": "/courses/3974/sections/001", "id": "3974-001", "aliases": ["ECON-005-001"]}, {"name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "ECON-005-002", "path": "/courses/3974/sections/002", "id": "3974-002", "aliases": ["ECON-005-002"]}, {"name": "STAT FOR ECONSTS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-005-601", "path": "/courses/3974/sections/601", "id": "3974-601", "aliases": ["ECON-005-601"]}]}, "id": 3974, "aliases": ["ECON-005"]}
