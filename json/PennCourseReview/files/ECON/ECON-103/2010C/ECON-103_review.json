The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. The class focuses on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course, and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, students found the course material \u201cextremely boring,\u201d but praised Professor de Paula\u2019s ability to \u201cmake it relatively fun.\u201d According to one student, \u201cthe class was kept on a clear and fair schedule.\u201d Others, however, felt that the difficulty of the exams did not reflect the material on the practice sets and in-class examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents called Professor de Paula \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cvery helpful,\u201d and \u201cvery organized.\u201d Many appreciated his efforts to take material they found dull by nature and \u201csomehow make it interesting and entertaining.\u201d Students felt that he was able to \u201ccommunicate the material well,\u201d and appreciated his \u201cgood sense of humor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile some found the tests \u201cchallenging,\u201d others felt well prepared by the problem sets and Professor de Paula\u2019s accessibility.
