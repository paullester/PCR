The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. Empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own.\r\n\tStudents described the class as a fairly standard, introductory statistics course. They found the material to move somewhat slowly, though they did not seem to have any complains regarding the difficulty of the content. \r\n\tMany students described Professor Decarolis as \"very helpful\" and \"accessible\" outside of class.  While his lectures were \"clear,\" many students complained that they were sometimes \"dry\" or \"dull.\"\r\n\tStudents found the course load to be very manageable. This class is required for the Economics major.
