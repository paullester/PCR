Some thought it was helpful in explaining certain economic concepts, but some also believed it did not teach them anything helpful related to economics, and what they did learn, students taught themselves. The class was noted as \u201cwell-structured,\u201d but \u201cone of the most difficult\u201d economics classes offered, as the class used PowerPoints and old lecture notes to convey the material. In addition, students were frustrated with the difficulty of the tests relative to the problem sets.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tang received mixed reviews as well. While most students agreed that he was \u201cvery approachable and helpful in office hours,\u201d they conceded that during class he seemed unfocused and did not explain concepts well, stating that while some questions seemed to be \u201cno-brainers\u201d some students struggled to keep up simply because of the teaching style. And while many students felt he was relatively clear in his explanations, his accent was \u201chard to keep up with at times.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents had trouble with the grading of this class. The final was worth 50% of the grade, while each midterm was only worth 15%. This course was recommended for Economics majors only.\r\n", "num_students": 87, "path": "/courses/24268/sections/001/reviews/4299-XUN-TANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4299-XUN-TANG", "first_name": "XUN", "last_name": "TANG", "id": "4299-XUN-TANG", "name": "XUN TANG"}, "num_reviewers": 72, "id": "24268-001-4299-XUN-TANG"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "1.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "2.85", "rReadingsValue": "2.37", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "2.58", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "STAT FOR ECONOMISTS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-103-601", "path": "/courses/24268/sections/601", "id": "24268-601", "aliases": ["ECON-103-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/24268/sections/601/reviews/5735-CAN-TIAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5735-CAN-TIAN", "first_name": "CAN", "last_name": "TIAN", "id": "5735-CAN-TIAN", "name": "CAN TIAN"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "24268-601-5735-CAN-TIAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-103", "path": "/courses/24268", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24268/sections", "values": [{"name": "STAT FOR ECONOMISTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-103-001", "path": "/courses/24268/sections/001", "id": "24268-001", "aliases": ["ECON-103-001"]}, {"name": "STAT FOR ECONOMISTS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ECON-103-601", "path": "/courses/24268/sections/601", "id": "24268-601", "aliases": ["ECON-103-601"]}]}, "id": 24268, "aliases": ["ECON-103"]}
