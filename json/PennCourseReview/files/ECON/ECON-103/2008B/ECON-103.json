{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2511"}, "description": "The course focuses on elementary probability and inferential statistical techniques. The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression. The course focuses on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course, and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. \n\n", "semester": "2008B", "name": "STAT FOR ECONOMISTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19508/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "STAT FOR ECONOMISTS", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "ECON-103-920", "path": "/courses/19508/sections/920", "id": "19508-920", "aliases": ["ECON-103-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/19508/sections/920/reviews/5108-MICHELA-MARIA-TINCANI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5108-MICHELA-MARIA-TINCANI", "first_name": "MICHELA MARIA", "last_name": "TINCANI", "id": "5108-MICHELA-MARIA-TINCANI", "name": "MICHELA MARIA TINCANI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "19508-920-5108-MICHELA-MARIA-TINCANI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-103", "path": "/courses/19508", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19508/sections", "values": [{"name": "STAT FOR ECONOMISTS", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "ECON-103-920", "path": "/courses/19508/sections/920", "id": "19508-920", "aliases": ["ECON-103-920"]}]}, "id": 19508, "aliases": ["ECON-103"]}
