Topics included: property rights and intellectual property; analysis of antitrust and economic analysis of legal decision making.\r\n\r\nStudents in general felt that the class covered \u201ctoo much game theory and not enough legal theory.\u201d Many students complained of a lack of structure in the course, and often felt unsure of what was covered on exams. Students felt that the course suffered from \u201cswitching between a variety of readings\u201d that, while \u201chelpful and engaging\u201d, often resulted in a haphazard covering of the material. Most students enjoyed the guest speakers brought in, and some did feel that it was a \u201cgreat academic/intellectual course.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students felt that Professor Scachmurove was \u201cpassionate and engaged\u201d, \u201ctried very hard to connect with his students\u201d and was \u201cvery willing to help\u201d.

Overall, most students agreed that Professor Scachmurove had \u201cgood intentions\u201d, but his teaching style needed work, in the words of one student, \u201cspeak loudly and have enthusiasm, you have great things to say.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents felt that this course would really only be suitable for an economics major.", "num_students": 96, "path": "/courses/20026/sections/001/reviews/339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE", "first_name": "YOCHANAN", "last_name": "SHACHMUROVE", "id": "339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE", "name": "YOCHANAN SHACHMUROVE"}, "num_reviewers": 56, "id": "20026-001-339-YOCHANAN-SHACHMUROVE"}]
