Students felt that the course could use some restructuring.\r\n\r\nWhile most students agreed that Professor Garcia-Jimeno was \u201cnice\u201d they almost remarked that it was \u201coverwhelmingly obvious that this was the first course he taught.\u201d His grading policies weren\u2019t as clear as they should have been and many students called him \u201cabrasive.\u201d It was often said that he read directly off the slides and was \u201cunwilling to help students.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents said that the material for this course was interesting, but could have been presented in a different manner. It was often stated that a lot of calculus was necessary to do the problem sets, and that wasn\u2019t a prerequisite for the course.
