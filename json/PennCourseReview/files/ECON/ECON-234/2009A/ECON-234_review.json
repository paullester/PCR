The class will discuss tort law, property law, intellectual property, and antitrust regulation with a distinction made between common law and legislative law.\r\nStudents felt that the \u201ccurrent and relevant\u201d material made this an enlightening course. However, they found it \u201cpoorly planned,\u201d focusing more on game theory than on law and economics; topics were \u201cscattered\u201d and sometimes even \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to law and economics. There were several guest lectures, which some found informative and \u201ca nice change of pace,\u201d but others commented that they wasted time, leaving students to learn the material on their own from an \u201cintensely detailed and difficult text.\u201d Assignments included multiple projects, quizzes, and midterms.\r\nStudents were split in opinion of Professor Shachmurove.
