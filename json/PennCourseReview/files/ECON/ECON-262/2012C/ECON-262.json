{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5111"}, "description": "Traditionally, economics focuses on the study of existing markets. Recently, regulators, entrepreneurs and economists have been involved in the design of markets. They have created institutionalized markets for new products, and have redesigned existing markets that were dysfunctional. This course utilizes ideas from game theory and microeconomics to provide the theoretical underpinnings for design and analysis of such markets. Further, via real world examples, we study the practical aspects of such market design and the institutional details which can determine the success or failure of a design. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "MARKET DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28822/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.13", "rTAQuality": "1.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.85", "rWorkRequired": "2.74", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "MARKET DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-262-001", "path": "/courses/28822/sections/001", "id": "28822-001", "aliases": ["ECON-262-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/28822/sections/001/reviews/5610-MALLESH-M--PAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5610-MALLESH-M--PAI", "first_name": "MALLESH M.", "last_name": "PAI", "id": "5610-MALLESH-M--PAI", "name": "MALLESH M.
