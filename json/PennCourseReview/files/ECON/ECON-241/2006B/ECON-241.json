{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3547"}, "description": "The process of economic growth and the sources of differences in economic performance across nations are some of the most interesting, important and challenging areas in modern social science. You cannot travel or read the news without wondering why differences in standards of living among countries are so large. The primary purpose of this course is to introduce undergraduate students to these major issues nd to the theoretical tools necessary for studying them. The course therefore strives to provide students with a solid background in dynamic economic analysis, as well as empirical examples and data analysis. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "TPCS MACRO-GRWTH/DEVLPM: Topics in Growth, Development and Business Cycles", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9719/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-241", "path": "/courses/9719", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9719/sections", "values": [{"name": "TPCS MACRO-GRWTH/DEVLPM: Topics in Growth, Development and Business Cycles", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "ECON-241-900", "path": "/courses/9719/sections/900", "id": "9719-900", "aliases": ["ECON-241-900"]}]}, "id": 9719, "aliases": ["ECON-241"]}
