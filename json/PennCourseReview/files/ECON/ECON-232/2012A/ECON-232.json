They mentioned that he was a \u201cgreat communicator\u201d and that he \u201cmakes a potentially dry subject very exciting.\u201d He is \u201can awesome lecturer\u201d and \u201cyou can tell how passionate he is about the subject matter.\u201d Professor Merlo, according to one student, is \u201cthe only Economics professor I've had at Penn who truly lives up to the incredible reputation of this institution.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe course does not have assigned readings and is referred to by one of the students as having \u201cvery little work: just two midterms and a final.\u201d The prerequisites are ECON 101; MATH 104 and MATH 114 or MATH 115. ECON 103 is recommended. This is an LPS 200-level course, which will not count for Economics Majors unless you are officially registered as an LPS student.", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/27269/sections/401/reviews/344-ANTONIO-M--MERLO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/344-ANTONIO-M--MERLO", "first_name": "ANTONIO M.", "last_name": "MERLO", "id": "344-ANTONIO-M--MERLO", "name": "ANTONIO M.
