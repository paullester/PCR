Facts and theories about the determination of per capita income and its differences across countries and across time.  The study of economic fluctuations in output and employment.  The role of government in influencing these aggregate variables: monetary and fiscal policy.\r\n\r\nA majority of students seemed to enjoy this \u201cinteresting\u201d econ class that is on par with other econ courses taught at Penn. While the material is basic and required for all econ majors, students felt this particular course might be a bit too narrow in focus, wishing it would expand to other macroeconomic topics. Overall, however, students generally felt this course was a good one to take to gain a good knowledge of macroeconomics. One complaint was that they didn\u2019t know where they stood in the class until the end.\r\n\r\nA vast majority of students attributed their liking of the course to Professor Akcigit, whom they said, \u201creally knows how to explain the math behind the issues.\u201d He was very capable at explaining the material in a way that makes it \u201cinteresting and understandable.\u201d It was noted however, that Professor Akcigit was hard to get into contact with, and was often 5-10 minutes late to class.\r\n\r\nStudents really liked the structure of this course and thought it is good for econ and non-econ majors.
