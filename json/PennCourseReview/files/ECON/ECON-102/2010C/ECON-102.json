Then it moves onto the study of economic fluctuations in output and employment. Lastly, it examines the role of government in influencing these aggregate variables: monetary and fiscal policy.\r\n\r\nMost students described the course as \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201cmathematically based.\u201d Quantitative and qualitative points are provided in class to make the content more interesting. The course goes into a lot of detailed description of macro-economic theories. A few students expressed their concern about the lack of time to prepare for the final because a lot of important information was presented in the last week. \r\n\r\nA large number of students enjoyed Professor Villaverde\u2019s class and described him as a \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable\u201d teacher. However, some felt that he was not welcoming enough of questions. Professor Villaverde grades the exams and is said to be a tough grader with harsh re-grading standards. As a whole, most students enjoyed being in the professor\u2019s class and said he is a great professor for upper-level courses. \r\n\r\nMost students found the homework \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201cambiguous\u201d at times. Many wished there were more in-class examples to make sense of the material. The course is quite mathematically intensive and goes into detail on macro-economic theory. It is not suggested that a non-Economics major take this course due to the tough materials covered. The course intensifies in workload and comprehension towards the end of the semester.\r\n", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/22924/sections/001/reviews/326-JESUS-FERNANDEZ-VILLAVERDE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/326-JESUS-FERNANDEZ-VILLAVERDE", "first_name": "JESUS", "last_name": "FERNANDEZ-VILLAVERDE", "id": "326-JESUS-FERNANDEZ-VILLAVERDE", "name": "JESUS FERNANDEZ-VILLAVERDE"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "22924-001-326-JESUS-FERNANDEZ-VILLAVERDE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-102", "path": "/courses/22924", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22924/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMED MACROECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-102-001", "path": "/courses/22924/sections/001", "id": "22924-001", "aliases": ["ECON-102-001"]}]}, "id": 22924, "aliases": ["ECON-102"]}
