While some students found the material intriguing, others thought it was too \u201cabstract\u201d at times. One student called the course content \u201cfascinating,\u201d noting that \u201csome of the conclusions of some models were very interesting.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents found Professor Matthews \u201cvery knowledgeable,\u201d but also indicated that he could have stimulated student interest more effectively. Students also felt that the professor did not have a good sense of what elements of the course were more difficult than others, and thus spent too little time explaining the more complex ideas. Many students also expressed that they required extensive use of other resources, such as the textbook, in order to comfortably grasp course concepts. \r\n\r\nStudents appreciated the variety of class formats, noting that simulations, movie clips, demonstrations, and games complemented lectures well. A few students were displeased with the grading structure, as one student stated, \u201cProblem sets should be counted for a grade as well as the exams,\u201d and another added, \u201cThe tests themselves were generally way harder than what was covered in class or the textbook.\u201d", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/25890/sections/001/reviews/342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS", "first_name": "STEVEN A", "last_name": "MATTHEWS", "id": "342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS", "name": "STEVEN A MATTHEWS"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "25890-001-342-STEVEN-A-MATTHEWS"}]
