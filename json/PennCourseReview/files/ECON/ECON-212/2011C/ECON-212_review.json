The class explores strategic behavior in different contexts of social science. Trade, corporate strategy, and public policy provide examples and practical applications for the course.  \r\n\r\nStudents on the whole felt that the class had an interesting premise. One student complained that some of the concepts seemed to contradict each other. Another warned prospective students that the class picks up dramatically in the final third of the semester. \r\n\r\nA majority of students enjoyed and appreciated the passion that Professor Postelwaite poured into the material. One student, however, expressed concern about how busy the professor was and felt that he did not give enough attention to undergraduates.  \r\n\r\nThis course requires students to have completed MATH 104 and 114 or 115, as well as ECON 101.  Additionally, students cannot count this or any LPS course toward an Econ major unless they are registered as LPS students. Most students enjoyed the material but felt that the exams and problem sets were time-consuming and difficult. \r\n\r\n*This review is based on only 7 student reviews.\r\n", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/24271/sections/301/reviews/3934-ANDREW-POSTLEWAITE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3934-ANDREW-POSTLEWAITE", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "POSTLEWAITE", "id": "3934-ANDREW-POSTLEWAITE", "name": "ANDREW POSTLEWAITE"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "24271-301-3934-ANDREW-POSTLEWAITE"}]
