{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4557"}, "description": "This course will show how individuals make decisions in a world full of uncertainties, both normatively and descriptively. This theory will help us build skills in understanding and analyzing a choice problem with uncertainty in a systematic fashion, as well as deepening our understanding of the fundamental concept of a utility function, which plays a critical role in economic modeling. The course requires a substantial ability of abstract thinking. Homework is intended to be thought-provoking rather than skill-sharpening. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DECISION MAKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28820/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.33", "rTAQuality": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "DECISION MAKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-260-001", "path": "/courses/28820/sections/001", "id": "28820-001", "aliases": ["ECON-260-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/28820/sections/001/reviews/6260-ANQI-LI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6260-ANQI-LI", "first_name": "ANQI", "last_name": "LI", "id": "6260-ANQI-LI", "name": "ANQI LI"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "28820-001-6260-ANQI-LI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-260", "path": "/courses/28820", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28820/sections", "values": [{"name": "DECISION MAKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-260-001", "path": "/courses/28820/sections/001", "id": "28820-001", "aliases": ["ECON-260-001"]}]}, "id": 28820, "aliases": ["ECON-260"]}
