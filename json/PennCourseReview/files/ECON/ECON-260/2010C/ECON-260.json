{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4557"}, "description": "This course will show how individuals make decisions in a world full of uncertainties, both normatively and descriptively. This theory will help us build skills in understanding and analyzing a choice problem with uncertainty in a systematic fashion, as well as deepening our understanding of the fundamental concept of a utility function, which plays a critical role in economic modeling. The course requires a substantial ability of abstract thinking. Homework is intended to be thought-provoking rather than skill-sharpening. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "Info Econ and Decision Making Under Uncertainty", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.11", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.11", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "2.44", "rReadingsValue": "1.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.11", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "Info Econ and Decision Making Under Uncertainty", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-260-001", "path": "/courses/22941/sections/001", "id": "22941-001", "aliases": ["ECON-260-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/22941/sections/001/reviews/2442-JING-LI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2442-JING-LI", "first_name": "JING", "last_name": "LI", "id": "2442-JING-LI", "name": "JING LI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "22941-001-2442-JING-LI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ECON-260", "path": "/courses/22941", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22941/sections", "values": [{"name": "Info Econ and Decision Making Under Uncertainty", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-260-001", "path": "/courses/22941/sections/001", "id": "22941-001", "aliases": ["ECON-260-001"]}]}, "id": 22941, "aliases": ["ECON-260"]}
