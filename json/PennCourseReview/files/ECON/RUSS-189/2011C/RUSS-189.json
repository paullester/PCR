{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5264"}, "description": "The course will cover the development and operation of the Soviet centrally planned economy--one of the grandest social experiments of the 20th century. We will review the mechanisms of plan creation, the push for the collectivization and further development of Soviet agriculture, the role of the Soviet educational system and the performance of labor markets (including forced labor camps--GULags). We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system and the causes of its collapse. Privatization, called by some \"piratization,\" will be one of the central issues in our consideration of the transition from central planning to a market economy in the early 1990s. Even though our main focus will be on the Soviet economy and post-Soviet transition, we will occasionally look back in time to the tsarist era and even further back to find evidence to help explain Soviet/Russian economic development. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "SOVIET & POST-SOV ECON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25077/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "2.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "SOVIET & POST-SOV ECON", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-189-401", "path": "/courses/25077/sections/401", "id": "25077-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-189-401", "ECON-062-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/25077/sections/401/reviews/3257-ALEXANDER-VEKKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3257-ALEXANDER-VEKKER", "first_name": "ALEXANDER", "last_name": "VEKKER", "id": "3257-ALEXANDER-VEKKER", "name": "ALEXANDER VEKKER"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "25077-401-3257-ALEXANDER-VEKKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-189", "path": "/courses/25077", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25077/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOVIET & POST-SOV ECON", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-189-401", "path": "/courses/25077/sections/401", "id": "25077-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-189-401", "ECON-062-401"]}]}, "id": 25077, "aliases": ["RUSS-189", "ECON-062"]}
