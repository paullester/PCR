It will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory, using illustrations, applications, and cases drawn from business, economics, politics, sports, and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory, and the only prerequisites are some high-school algebra and ECON 001. However, general numeracy (facility interpreting and doing numerical graphs, tables, and arithmetic calculations) is very important. This course can be counted toward the Economics minor or as an Econ elective.\r\n\r\nMany students found that this course \u201chas the potential to be interesting\u201d because of the subject matter on \u201cstrategic reasoning skills applicable to life\u201d. However, students reported that \u201cthis was not an easy class\u201d and warned that both the course material and the difficulty of exams made PPE 201 challenging for those with only a light understanding of Economics. The math required was reported to be \u201cextremely heavy\u201d. Students hope that the material will be covered \u201cat a more meticulous pace\u201d if the course is to remain a requirement for PPE majors.\r\n\r\nWhile many students found Professor Dillenberger to be \u201centhusiastic about the subject material,\u201d and \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d others reported that he was often difficult to hear and understand. Questions could be addressed in office hours, where students said he was \u201cvery approachable\u201d. Office hours are the students\u2019 main source for assistance, as the course does not include recitations.\r\n\r\nGrading in this class was reported to be \u201cextremely harsh\u201d. Additionally, the difficulty level for the final exam was reported to be \u201cexponentially more difficult than anything else in the class, and Professor Dillenberger failed to prepare the students to be in a position where they could do well\u201d. The final was, however, curved to provide students with more acceptable grades. There were many complaints about coordination between the grader of the course and the professor for students felt that there was a \u201clack of communication\u201d. Some students complained that the system of re-grading is not generous for the four problem sets that are required throughout the course of the semester. Although the class is required for the PPE major, students warn that \u201cthe course overall will significantly hurt our GPAs\u201d.", "num_students": 122, "path": "/courses/17938/sections/401/reviews/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "DILLENBERGER", "id": "4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "name": "DAVID DILLENBERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 103, "id": "17938-401-4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER"}]
