{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4651"}, "description": "This course is about strategically interdependent decisions. In such situations, the outcome of your actions depends also on the actions of others. When making your choice, you have to think what the others will choose, who in turn are thinking what you will be choosing, and so on. Game Theory offers several concepts and insights for understanding such situations, and for making better strategic choices. This course will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory, using illustrations, applications, and cases drawn from business, economics, politics, sports, and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory, and the only pre-requisites are some high-school algebra and having taken Econ 1. However, general numeracy (facility interpreting and doing numerical graphs, tables, and arithmetic calculations) is very important. This course will also be accepted by the Economics department as an Econ course, to be counted toward the minor in Economics (or as an Econ elective). \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "STRATEGIC REASONING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23654/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "3.19", "rStimulateInterest": "1.81", "rRecommendMajor": "2.76", "rCourseQuality": "2.08", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.34", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.56", "rCommAbility": "1.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.13"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC REASONING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PPE-201-401", "path": "/courses/23654/sections/401", "id": "23654-401", "aliases": ["PPE-201-401", "ECON-013-401"]}, "comments": "This course is about strategically interdependent decisions.

One student found it to be an \"incredibly interesting course that allowed [him] to think about real-world scenarios from a more theoretical perspective.\" Some found \"the course content to be really fascinating.\"\r\n\r\nMost students had mixed feelings about Professor Dillenberger. One student said, \"Although Professor Dillenberger is passionate about what he teaches, he was difficult for me to understand,\u201d because of his English. Professor Dillenberger tends to lecture as if \"teaching students of a very high level.\" On the other hand, \"Professor Dillenberger did a good job trying to engage students by playing real games in class, and tried to make the problems have real world applications.\"\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites are some high school algebra and Econ 001, but students recommend that those taking the course have a firm grasp of both algebra and calculus. Most students found the exams and problem sets to be very difficult. One student said, \"It's a hard class which requires a lot of effort, but that can be done, and done well, if one gives it their all.\" Most students took this class to fulfill a major or minor requirement.\r\n", "num_students": 119, "path": "/courses/23654/sections/401/reviews/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "DILLENBERGER", "id": "4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER", "name": "DAVID DILLENBERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 110, "id": "23654-401-4533-DAVID-DILLENBERGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PPE-201", "path": "/courses/23654", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23654/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC REASONING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PPE-201-401", "path": "/courses/23654/sections/401", "id": "23654-401", "aliases": ["PPE-201-401", "ECON-013-401"]}]}, "id": 23654, "aliases": ["PPE-201", "ECON-013"]}
