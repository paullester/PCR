{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2514"}, "description": "This course introduces students to advanced study in econometrics, with an emphasis on methods used in microeconomic applications and in evaluating the effects of social interventions. The methods covered include methods for handling limited dependent variables (useful, for example, in forecasting the demand for a new good), maximum likelihood estimators, and flexible semiparametric and non parametric estimation methods, and randomized and nonexperimental methods of estimating treatment effects. Applications of econometrics to the field of program evaluation will also be studied. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "ADVANCED ECON TECH & APP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7573/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.26", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.09", "rRecommendMajor": "2.70", "rCourseQuality": "2.52", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "2.87", "rReadingsValue": "1.48", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.74", "rCommAbility": "2.17", "rInstructorQuality": "2.48"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED ECON TECH & APP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ECON-222-001", "path": "/courses/7573/sections/001", "id": "7573-001", "aliases": ["ECON-222-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/7573/sections/001/reviews/345-PETRA-E--TODD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/345-PETRA-E--TODD", "first_name": "PETRA E.", "last_name": "TODD", "id": "345-PETRA-E--TODD", "name": "PETRA E.
