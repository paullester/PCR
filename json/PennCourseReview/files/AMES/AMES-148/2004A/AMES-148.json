{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2704"}, "description": "A study of Jerusalem, the sacred city for three different world religions, is fundamental to a rich understanding of the history and religions of the Middle East. Beginning in antiquity and continuing through the medieval and modern periods, this course will chronicle the rise, fall and reconstruction of Jerusalem many times over. Particular emphasis will be placed on the archaeology and architecture of the city, the phenomenology of sacred space, the meanings of Jerusalem in art, and the religious history of the city. We will investigate the meanings Jerusalem has had in the past and will also consider current questions about its future. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "JERUSALEM THROUGH AGES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6073/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "JERUSALEM THROUGH AGES", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AMES-148-601", "path": "/courses/6073/sections/601", "id": "6073-601", "aliases": ["AMES-148-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/6073/sections/601/reviews/2726-WILLIAM-ZIMMERLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2726-WILLIAM-ZIMMERLE", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "ZIMMERLE", "id": "2726-WILLIAM-ZIMMERLE", "name": "WILLIAM ZIMMERLE"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "6073-601-2726-WILLIAM-ZIMMERLE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-148", "path": "/courses/6073", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6073/sections", "values": [{"name": "JERUSALEM THROUGH AGES", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AMES-148-601", "path": "/courses/6073/sections/601", "id": "6073-601", "aliases": ["AMES-148-601"]}]}, "id": 6073, "aliases": ["AMES-148"]}
