{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1170"}, "description": "This course is intended as an introduction to the history of Chinese thought. The first part of the course is devoted to China's philosopical awakening in the 5th to 3rd centuries B.C. All subsequent philosophy continually returned to the problems defined during this formative period. We shall examine the various schools and thinkers of the time, and the ways in which representatives of different opinions reacted to each other. \n\nNext we follow the current of Chinese thought leading to the Confucian revival of the T'ang and Sung dynasties. This portion of the course culminates in an extensive examination of the philosophy of Chu Hsi (1130-1200), the most influential Neo-Confucian thinker. After considering some alternatives to Chu Hsi's vision put forward in later centuries, we assess the viability of Chinese thought in a modern context. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "INTRO CLASS CHINESE THGT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9969/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.04", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.54", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO CLASS CHINESE THGT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-184-401", "path": "/courses/9969/sections/401", "id": "9969-401", "aliases": ["AMES-184-401", "AMES-584-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/9969/sections/401/reviews/66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN", "first_name": "PAUL RAKITA", "last_name": "GOLDIN", "id": "66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN", "name": "PAUL RAKITA GOLDIN"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "9969-401-66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-184", "path": "/courses/9969", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9969/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO CLASS CHINESE THGT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-184-401", "path": "/courses/9969/sections/401", "id": "9969-401", "aliases": ["AMES-184-401", "AMES-584-401"]}]}, "id": 9969, "aliases": ["AMES-184", "AMES-584"]}
