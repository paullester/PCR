{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2712"}, "description": "This course aims to introduce students to the study of Islamic law, the all-embracing sacred law of Islam. Among the world's various legal systems, Islamic law may be the most widely misunderstood and even misrepresented; certainly, misconceptions about it abound. Islamic law is, however, the amazing product of a rich, fascinating and diverrse cultural and intellectual tradition. In this course we will attempt to consider many different facets of the historical, doctrinal, institutional and social complexity of Islamic law. The focus will be mostly, though not exclusively, on classical Islamic law. Specific topics covered include the beginnings of legal thought in Islam, various areas of Islamic positive law (substantive law), public and private legal institutions, Islamic legal theory, and issues in the contemporary development and application of Islamic law. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "INTRO ISLAMIC LAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6111/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "3.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO ISLAMIC LAW", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-538-301", "path": "/courses/6111/sections/301", "id": "6111-301", "aliases": ["AMES-538-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/6111/sections/301/reviews/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "first_name": "JOSEPH E.", "last_name": "LOWRY", "id": "2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "name": "JOSEPH E.
