{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3596"}, "description": "Though many Americans know the cultures of China, Korea, and Japan through military and romantic images such as those of The Last Samurai, there is a long history of literature and art related to the creators of literature in East Asia. The practice of calligraphy as a visual art and of poetry as a literary form have in fact dominated the cultural history of this large segment of the world's population. Using primary texts in translation, this freshman seminar will explore the complex relationship between poets and painters, intellectual creators and visual artists, over the history of China, Japan, and to a lesser extent, Korea, from the beginnings of the civil bureaucracy in China in the first century through the rise of women as literati artists in Japan in the nineteenth. Students will develop analytic skills through discussion and investigation of written texts, composed prose and poems, and painted representations; they will become familiar with a variety of visual artists and forms as well as with the broad sweep of East Asian history. Background in Asian languages and cultures is not required. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "LITERATI ARTS EAST ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9970/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "1.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "1.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "LITERATI ARTS EAST ASIA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-188-301", "path": "/courses/9970/sections/301", "id": "9970-301", "aliases": ["AMES-188-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/9970/sections/301/reviews/1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "first_name": "FRANK L.", "last_name": "CHANCE", "id": "1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "name": "FRANK L.
