{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3772"}, "description": "This course provides a survey of the genres and major figures in Arabic literary history from the 6th century up to the present day. Selections will be read in translation after a general introduction to the cultural background and a session devoted to the Qur'an and its influence, a sequence of sessions will be devoted to poetry, narratives, drama, and criticism. Each set of texts is accompanied by a collection of background readings which place the authors and works into a literary, political and societal context. This course thus attempts to place the phenomenon of \"literature\" into the larger context of Islamic studies by illustrating the links between Arab litterateurs and other contributors to the development of an Islamic/Arab culture on the one hand and by establishing connections between the Arabic literary tradition and that of other (and particularly Western) traditions. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "ARABIC LITERARY HERITAGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12176/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.15", "rReadingsValue": "3.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.23", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "ARABIC LITERARY HERITAGE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-233-401", "path": "/courses/12176/sections/401", "id": "12176-401", "aliases": ["NELC-233-401", "COML-215-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/12176/sections/401/reviews/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "first_name": "ROGER", "last_name": "ALLEN", "id": "274-ROGER-ALLEN", "name": "ROGER ALLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "12176-401-274-ROGER-ALLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-233", "path": "/courses/12176", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12176/sections", "values": [{"name": "ARABIC LITERARY HERITAGE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-233-401", "path": "/courses/12176/sections/401", "id": "12176-401", "aliases": ["NELC-233-401", "COML-215-401"]}]}, "id": 12176, "aliases": ["NELC-233", "COML-215"]}
