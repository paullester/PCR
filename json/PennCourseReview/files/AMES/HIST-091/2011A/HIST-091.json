It has two principal aims: 1) to provide a general narrative of events from 1600 to the present. 2) to introduce students to the most powerful tool of historical analysis: an awareness of the importance of interpretation. Readings include primary and secondary source materials. Students are asked to identify important people and events, and to identify and contemplate different perspectives on the past and present.\r\n\r\nStudents thoroughly enjoyed HIST 91. The course was applauded for \u201cchallenging [students] to think beyond the usual assumptions of history.\u201d Overall, students felt that the course greatly \u201cfacilitated understanding of Japanese history.\u201d This \u201cawesome\u201d course was elevated primarily by Professor Dickinson\u2019s lectures, though students appreciated the primary source reading selections that were not based solely on the textbook. As students felt that the main text was \u201cnot particularly well-written,\u201d the material was made \u201cfar less dry\u201d by the inclusion of these primary source materials. \r\n\r\nProfessor Dickinson received high praise for his passion for the subject of Japanese history. \u201cWithout his true enthusiasm on the topic,\u201d one student wrote, \u201cI would not have enjoyed the class so much.\u201d Students felt that Professor Dickinson presented the material in \u201ca very interesting and enjoyable manner,\u201d and that his \u201canimated style infused the lectures with an energy that is all too often lacking in history course.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe workload was considered very manageable. Readings came from six different texts. Grades were based on four components: class participation (which included blog posts and class reports), two \u201cthought essays,\u201d a mid-term exam and a take-home final exam. There are no prerequisites to the course.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/21848/sections/401/reviews/619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "first_name": "FREDERICK R.", "last_name": "DICKINSON", "id": "619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "name": "FREDERICK R.
