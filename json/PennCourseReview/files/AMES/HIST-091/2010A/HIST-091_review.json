Special emphasis is given to the turbulent relationship between state and society from 1800 to the present. \r\n\r\nMany of the students in Modern Japanese History found the course to be engaging and \u201ctruly interesting,\u201d but a few said that it was \u201cpainfully boring;\u201d a remark that seemed to stem from disagreement with the professor's method of teaching. Students generally considered the readings \u201cfine\u201d and liked the fact that literature is incorporated into the class. However, many of the students did not appreciate that Professor Dickinson \u201cwould not really start the lecture until a half-an-hour into the course.\u201d This was because \u201c 30 minutes of each lecture are used for silly anecdotes and music videos,\u201d which many students did not think \u201cconnect[ed] to the material in a meaningful way usually.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents' reactions to Professor Dickinson's teaching methods were wildly different. Some taking the course said that Professor Dickinson is \u201cthe most interesting teacher I have had to date,\u201d \u201chilarious,\u201d and that Professor Dickinson made it \u201c one of the best courses\u201d that one student ever took. However, almost all students reported that Professor Dickinson has certain unique opinions on Japanese history that color \u201calmost all of his lectures\u201d and that are \u201cnot open to debate.\u201d Some found that these interpretations \u201cactually made the class more interesting,\u201d but others thought his take on Japan \u201cborders on revisionist history\u201d and was \u201cvery often not entirely corroborated by the readings assigned.\u201d Many of those who did disagree with his teaching style still complimented Professor Dickinson for his \u201cwealth of knowledge\u201d and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the History and Tradition Sector as well as Cross Cultural Analysis.", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/26183/sections/401/reviews/619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "first_name": "FREDERICK R.", "last_name": "DICKINSON", "id": "619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "name": "FREDERICK R.
