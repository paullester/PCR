{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/59"}, "description": "The study of four paradigmatic and classic Jewish texts so as to introduce students to the literature of classic Judaism. Each text will be studied historically -- \"excavated\" for its sources and roots -- and holistically, as a canonical document in Jewish tradition. While each text will inevitably raise its own set of issues, we will deal throughout the semester with two basic questions: What makes a \"Jewish\" text? And how do these texts represent different aspects of Jewish identity? All readings will be in translation. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "GREAT BOOKS OF JUDAISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3696/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.42", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.42", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.08", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "GREAT BOOKS OF JUDAISM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-151-401", "path": "/courses/3696/sections/401", "id": "3696-401", "aliases": ["AMES-151-401", "RELS-027-401", "COML-057-401", "JWST-151-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/3696/sections/401/reviews/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "first_name": "DAVID M.", "last_name": "STERN", "id": "61-DAVID-M--STERN", "name": "DAVID M.
