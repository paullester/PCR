{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2734"}, "description": "We live in a world inundated with media and saturated with images. What might be reported through television, documentary films, or magazines was once presented via illustrated texts and prints or else commemorated in public murals or statues. This course will follow the emergence of modern media - culminating in photography, film, and digital media - in an increasingly public and democratic sphere of art. Social changes in courts and cities, especially in the wake of the Industrial and French Revolutions, resulted from increasing capitalism and democracy. Artists had to adjust to new roles, media, and means of support. This course will introduce students from diverse backgrounds to visual media in culture and society, providing both critical and historical tools for visual literacy in the modern world. No Prerequisites. \n\nTaught regularly in spring term. It replaces the former ARTH 102 introductory course and satisfies History of Art 100-level course requirements. \n\nIn consultation with the Undergraduate Chair, CGS students may be allowed to substitute CGS-taught ARTH 101 or 102 courses for the new ARTH 001 OR 002, respectively \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "The Rise of Modern Visual Media", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14093/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "2.34", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.70", "rWorkRequired": "2.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.02", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "2.93", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "The Rise of Modern Visual Media", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ARTH-002-001", "path": "/courses/14093/sections/001", "id": "14093-001", "aliases": ["ARTH-002-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 141, "path": "/courses/14093/sections/001/reviews/1982-LARRY-A--SILVER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1982-LARRY-A--SILVER", "first_name": "LARRY A.", "last_name": "SILVER", "id": "1982-LARRY-A--SILVER", "name": "LARRY A.
