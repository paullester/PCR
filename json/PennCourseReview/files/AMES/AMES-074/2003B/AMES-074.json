{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/44"}, "description": "Along with AMES 174, this is a four-semester sequence, beginning each Fall. Students cannot begin their studies in the Spring, as we do not offer the first (or third) semesters then. The objective of the course is to help students build a solid foundation of the four basic skills--listening, speaking, reading, and writing. By the end of two semesters, students should achieve the following goals: 1) pronounce all the sounds in Mandarin accurately and comfortably with a good command of the four tones; 2) carry out simple dialogues of familiar topics; 3) recognize and reproduce approximately 300-350 characters; and 4) read short textbook stories and write simple notes. In order to develop students' listening and speaking ability, oral communication tasks are given every other week. \n\n", "semester": "2003B", "name": "BEGINNING CHINESE I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2345/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-074", "path": "/courses/2345", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2345/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEGINNING CHINESE I", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "AMES-074-910", "path": "/courses/2345/sections/910", "id": "2345-910", "aliases": ["AMES-074-910"]}]}, "id": 2345, "aliases": ["AMES-074"]}
