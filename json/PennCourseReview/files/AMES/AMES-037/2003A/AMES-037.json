{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1165"}, "description": "During the past hundred years, Egypt has been the cultural and political pacesetter in the Middle East. It has been on the cutting edge of developments in Arabic literature, movies, and music, and has produced intellectual leaders ranging from feminists to Muslim activists. In the 1950s and '60s, the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser inspired the pan-Arab movement and at the same time made his country a central player in postcolonial Africa. Meanwhile, Egypt led the Arab countries in opposing the state of Israel until breaking ranks in 1978 to sign peace accords at Camp David. In this class, we will approach the history of twentieth-century Egypt through the lives of a spectrum of its peoples, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews; presidents and peasants; singers, writers, and radical thinkers. Along the way we will examine the social pressures that have inspired modern Egyptian revolutionaries and militants, and attempt to explain the reasons for the country's continuing prominence in the Arab and Muslim worlds. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "PEOPLE OF MODERN EGYPT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1186/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "PEOPLE OF MODERN EGYPT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-037-301", "path": "/courses/1186/sections/301", "id": "1186-301", "aliases": ["AMES-037-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/1186/sections/301/reviews/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "first_name": "HEATHER", "last_name": "SHARKEY", "id": "1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "name": "HEATHER SHARKEY"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "1186-301-1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-037", "path": "/courses/1186", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1186/sections", "values": [{"name": "PEOPLE OF MODERN EGYPT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-037-301", "path": "/courses/1186/sections/301", "id": "1186-301", "aliases": ["AMES-037-301"]}]}, "id": 1186, "aliases": ["AMES-037"]}
