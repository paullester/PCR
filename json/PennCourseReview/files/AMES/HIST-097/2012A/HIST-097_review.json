How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course offers an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. The course starts with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey focuses on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity.\r\n\r\nThe majority of students who reviewed this course expressed that they very much enjoyed it and learned a lot from its engaging content. As one student said, the course provided \u201can excellent view of modern China, in a very objective manner.\u201d  One of the only criticisms of the course was that it covered a very broad spectrum of history, and may have been more enjoyable if it had been able to take a more specific approach to some of the material.  \r\n\r\nSeveral students felt that Professor Fei was friendly, accessible outside of class, and eager to help her students succeed. While students complimented Professor Fei on delivering very animated and funny lectures, many of Professor Fei\u2019s students also mentioned the disorganized nature of these lectures, detracting for some students from the efficacy and clarity of the course. \r\n\r\nOne reviewer would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic, saying, \u201cI think the course is great for anyone who wants an interesting and manageable introductory course to modern Chinese history.\u201d ", "num_students": 99, "path": "/courses/27558/sections/401/reviews/2997-SI-YEN-FEI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2997-SI-YEN-FEI", "first_name": "SI-YEN", "last_name": "FEI", "id": "2997-SI-YEN-FEI", "name": "SI-YEN FEI"}, "num_reviewers": 82, "id": "27558-401-2997-SI-YEN-FEI"}]
