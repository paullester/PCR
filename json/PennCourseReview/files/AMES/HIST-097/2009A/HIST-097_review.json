It includes themes such as the interplay of new and traditional forces; the political role of new social classes; the search for viable models; war with Japan, civil war, and rural revolution; socialist construction and the development of the two-line struggle; the impact of Cold War; the Cutural Revolution; the opening to the West, economic reforms, and social ferment since the death of Mao.&#8232;&#8232;\r\nThis \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cinteresting but tough\u201d course provides an in-depth look at the history or China. Assignments include short essays and midterm and final exams. With so much material to cover, lectures remain \u201cvague,\u201d while readings prove to be most valuable. Overall, most called the class \u201cdisorganized,\u201d with \u201cdigressive\u201d lectures and \u201cpointless\u201d in-class role-plays.

Some complained that Professor Fei often rambled and \u201cconsistently ran the class well over time,\u201d but appreciated how she \u201ccombines real-life experience with theoretical discourse to engage her students in a unique way.\u201d One student called her \u201cone of the best professors at this institution.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\nThe course has an \u201castronomical\u201d amount of \u201cdense\u201d reading; although some were important, one \u201ccan get by without doing some of the other readings.\u201d Lectures had \u201clot of jumping around without any strong emphasis on what we should know.\u201d It was \u201cdifficult to know where one stands grade-wise.\u201d One student commented that it was challenging for someone who does not know Chinese to hear and differentiate all of the names and places immediately.
