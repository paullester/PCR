{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2451"}, "description": "This class is a reading- and discussion-intenstive seminar that addresses several recurring questions with regard to the Middle East and North Africa. How have Islam, Judaism, and Christianity influenced each other in these regions historically? How have Jews, Christians, and Muslims fared as religious minorities? To what extent have communal relations been characterized by harmony and cooperation, or by strife and discord, and how have these relations changed in diffferent contexts over time? To what extent and under what circumstances have members of these communities converted, intermarried, formed business alliances, and adopted or developed similar customs? How has the emergence of the modern nation-state system affected communal relations as well as the legal or social status of religious minorities in particular countries? How important has religion been as one variable in social identity (along with sect, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.), and to what extent has religious identity figured into regional conflicts and wars? The focus of the class will be on the modern period (c. 1800-present) although we will read about some relevant trends in the early and middle Islamic periods as well. Students will also pursue individually tailored research to produce final papers. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "MUSLIMS,CHRISTNS,JEWS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4910/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.42", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "MUSLIMS,CHRISTNS,JEWS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-335-401", "path": "/courses/4910/sections/401", "id": "4910-401", "aliases": ["AMES-335-401", "RELS-311-401", "AMES-535-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/4910/sections/401/reviews/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "first_name": "HEATHER", "last_name": "SHARKEY", "id": "1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "name": "HEATHER SHARKEY"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "4910-401-1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-335", "path": "/courses/4910", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4910/sections", "values": [{"name": "MUSLIMS,CHRISTNS,JEWS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-335-401", "path": "/courses/4910/sections/401", "id": "4910-401", "aliases": ["AMES-335-401", "RELS-311-401", "AMES-535-401"]}]}, "id": 4910, "aliases": ["AMES-335", "RELS-311", "AMES-535"]}
