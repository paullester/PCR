{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2452"}, "description": "This seminar views the phenomenon of nationalism as it affected the modern Middle East in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Together we will consider the diverse components of nationalism, including religion, language, territorial loyalty, and ethnicity, and test the thesis that nations are \"imagined communities\" built on \"invented traditions.\" At the same time, we will examine other forms of communal identity that transcend national borders or flourish on more localized scales. This class approaches nationalism and communal identity as complex products of cultural, political, and social forces, and places Middle Eastern experiences within a global context. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "NATIONALISM IN MID EAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4911/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.85", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "NATIONALISM IN MID EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-336-401", "path": "/courses/4911/sections/401", "id": "4911-401", "aliases": ["AMES-336-401", "AMES-536-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/4911/sections/401/reviews/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "first_name": "HEATHER", "last_name": "SHARKEY", "id": "1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY", "name": "HEATHER SHARKEY"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "4911-401-1494-HEATHER-SHARKEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-336", "path": "/courses/4911", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4911/sections", "values": [{"name": "NATIONALISM IN MID EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-336-401", "path": "/courses/4911/sections/401", "id": "4911-401", "aliases": ["AMES-336-401", "AMES-536-401"]}]}, "id": 4911, "aliases": ["AMES-336", "AMES-536"]}
