{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3108"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the modern academic study of the different genres of classical Rabbinic literature-- Mishnah and Tosefta; the Talmuds of Jerusalem and Babylonia; the literature of midrash (Biblical interpretation); and the prayerbook. In addition to studying the primary texts, the course will also explore the historical, religious, and cultural contexts in which these texts were first produced and then studied. The specific topic of the course (eg. Talmud, Rabbinic Narrative, Midrash) will vary from semester to semester. Primary sources will be read in the original language (Hebrew and Aramaic). While no previous experience in studying Rabbinic literature is required, students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts. If there is a question as to whether the course is appropriate for you, please see the professor. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "RABBINIC NARRATIVE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29066/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "RABBINIC NARRATIVE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-257-401", "path": "/courses/29066/sections/401", "id": "29066-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-257-401", "JWST-257-401", "HEBR-557-401", "RELS-226-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/29066/sections/401/reviews/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "first_name": "DAVID M.", "last_name": "STERN", "id": "61-DAVID-M--STERN", "name": "DAVID M.
