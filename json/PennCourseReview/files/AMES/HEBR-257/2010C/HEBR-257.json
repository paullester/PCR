{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3108"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the modern study of Talmudic literature-- Mishnah, Tosefta, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. The first part of the course will deal with the history of the concept of the Oral Law (Torah shebe'al peh) and its practice, and the history of the literature that eventually comes out of that oral tradition, including the history of its transmission in medieval manuscripts and printed editions, and the ways in which the material shape of the text influenced its study and reception in Jewish culture. The second part of the course will consist of an intensive analysis of one chapter in the Talmud, Berakhot 8, by tracing its history through the documents of Talmudic literature (the Mishnah, Tosefta, and two Talmuds). No previous experience in Rabbinic literature is required (although it is recommended), but all students must be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts. If you have a question as to whether this course is appropriate for you, please contact the professor. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "RESPONSES TO DESTRUCTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23192/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "RESPONSES TO DESTRUCTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-257-401", "path": "/courses/23192/sections/401", "id": "23192-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-257-401", "RELS-226-401", "HEBR-557-401", "JWST-257-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/23192/sections/401/reviews/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "first_name": "DAVID M.", "last_name": "STERN", "id": "61-DAVID-M--STERN", "name": "DAVID M.
