{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2686"}, "description": "China's transition to a market-oriented society has effected fundamental changes in the lives of citizens. This class will consider pressing social concerns that China must struggle to address as it continues down the path of market reforms. Using topical problems to illustrate broader issues of social inequality along lines of gender, ethnicity, residence status, and poverty status, we will consider questions such as the following: How are women and men faring differently in China's new labor market and workplaces? Are rural peasants and the emerging underclass of urban laid-off workers being left behind by market transition? How are minorities faring in China's transition? How does the emerging digital divide play into the dichotomies of east-west and urban-rural in China? What is the plight of millions of \"floaters\" migrating into China's cities, with minimal legal rights and protections? Can China's rapidly-changing public health system handle emerging diseases such as SARS and AIDS? How has the one-child policy affected women, children, and society in China? Who are the \"missing girls\" of China, and what are the social implications of their disappearance? How was the welfare of children and adolescents changed with market reforms? The class will combine lectures, academic readings, case studies, films, and discussions. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "SOC ISSUES CONTP CHINA: Social Issues in Contemporary China", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13914/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "1.96", "rStimulateInterest": "2.65", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.12", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "SOC ISSUES CONTP CHINA: Social Issues in Contemporary China", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-280-401", "path": "/courses/13914/sections/401", "id": "13914-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-280-401", "EALC-048-401", "SOCI-580-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/13914/sections/401/reviews/1098-EMILY-C--HANNUM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1098-EMILY-C--HANNUM", "first_name": "EMILY C.", "last_name": "HANNUM", "id": "1098-EMILY-C--HANNUM", "name": "EMILY C.
