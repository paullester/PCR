{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1916"}, "description": "This course will survey the history of relations among the great powers in East Asia from 1600 to the present. Special emphasis will be played upon the peculiarities of cross-national exchange in Asia (as compared to Europe), particularly the difficulties of relations among states possessing fundamentally different cultural traditions. We will explore the many informal, as well as formal, means of diplomacy in Asia over the past 400 years. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "EAST ASIAN DIPLOMACY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5462/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.41", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.58", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "EAST ASIAN DIPLOMACY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-395-401", "path": "/courses/5462/sections/401", "id": "5462-401", "aliases": ["HIST-395-401", "AMES-398-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/5462/sections/401/reviews/619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "first_name": "FREDERICK R.", "last_name": "DICKINSON", "id": "619-FREDERICK-R--DICKINSON", "name": "FREDERICK R.
