{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2210"}, "description": "Islam reached South Asia in the eighth century and Muslim rulers held sway overlarge parts of the Subcontinent for much of the period from the late 12th century until the colonial period. However, the majority of the population never converted to Islam, and since independence in 1947 Islam--its interpretation, realization, and influence--has been a major factor underlying many difficult political issues. This has been true not only in the largest country, India, where Muslims form 12% (unevenly distributed) of the population, but in Bangladesh and Pakistan where non-Muslims are relatively insignificant minorities. This course explores the realities and the perceptions related to Muslim identities and the Islamic heritage in the Subcontinent, and sets it in global context by comparison with other parts of the world which share various aspects of the South Asian experience. The course will conclude with an assessment of the larger significance--social, economic and political, as well as cultural--of Islam in South Asia today. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "ISLAM IN S.ASIAN CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3758/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM IN S.ASIAN CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-142-401", "path": "/courses/3758/sections/401", "id": "3758-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-142-401", "RELS-142-401", "AMES-102-401", "SARS-142-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/3758/sections/401/reviews/94-JACQUELINE-H-FEWKES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/94-JACQUELINE-H-FEWKES", "first_name": "JACQUELINE H", "last_name": "FEWKES", "id": "94-JACQUELINE-H-FEWKES", "name": "JACQUELINE H FEWKES"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "3758-401-94-JACQUELINE-H-FEWKES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-142", "path": "/courses/3758", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3758/sections", "values": [{"name": "ISLAM IN S.ASIAN CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-142-401", "path": "/courses/3758/sections/401", "id": "3758-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-142-401", "RELS-142-401", "AMES-102-401", "SARS-142-401"]}]}, "id": 3758, "aliases": ["ANTH-142", "RELS-142", "AMES-102", "SARS-142"]}
