{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2103"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to Islam as a religion as it exists in societies of the past as well as the present. It explores the many ways in which Muslims have interpreted and put into practice the prophetic message of Muhammad through historical and social analyses of varying theological, philosophical, legal, political, mystical and literary writings, as well as through visual art and music. The aim of the course is to develop a framework for explaining the sources and symbols through which specific experiences and understandings have been signified as Islamic, both by Muslims and by other peoples with whom they have come into contact, with particular emphasis given to issues of gender, religious violence and changes in beliefs and behaviors which have special relevance for contemporary society. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO ISLAM: INTRO TO ISLAMIC RELIG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22384/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "2.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.39"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO ISLAM: INTRO TO ISLAMIC RELIG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-143-401", "path": "/courses/22384/sections/401", "id": "22384-401", "aliases": ["RELS-143-401", "SAST-139-401", "NELC-136-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/22384/sections/401/reviews/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "first_name": "JAMAL J.", "last_name": "ELIAS", "id": "3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "name": "JAMAL J.
