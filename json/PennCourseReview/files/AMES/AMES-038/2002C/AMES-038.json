{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1606"}, "description": "Have you ever read the Tales of Sindbad and his travels? Do you like narratives about journeys, both ancient and contemporary? The purpose of this seminar is to introduce freshmen to a variety of narratives in different literary genres; to do so through the theme of the journey, whether it be a physical journey from one place to another, a process of change--a rite of passage perhaps, or an inward psychological quest. Female and male authors are presented, as are different periods in the long history of the Middle East and Africa. All the texts to be read are in English translation. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "NARRATIVES:AFRICA&ASIA: Narrative Journeys: Africa and Asia", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2504/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "NARRATIVES:AFRICA&ASIA: Narrative Journeys: Africa and Asia", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-038-301", "path": "/courses/2504/sections/301", "id": "2504-301", "aliases": ["AMES-038-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/2504/sections/301/reviews/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "first_name": "ROGER", "last_name": "ALLEN", "id": "274-ROGER-ALLEN", "name": "ROGER ALLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "2504-301-274-ROGER-ALLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-038", "path": "/courses/2504", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2504/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRATIVES:AFRICA&ASIA: Narrative Journeys: Africa and Asia", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-038-301", "path": "/courses/2504/sections/301", "id": "2504-301", "aliases": ["AMES-038-301"]}]}, "id": 2504, "aliases": ["AMES-038"]}
