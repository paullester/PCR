{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1176"}, "description": "The aim of this course is to introduce students to the critical methods and reference works used in the modern study of the Bible. To the extent possible, these methods will be illustrated as they apply to a single book of the Hebrew Bible that will serve as the main focus of the course. \n\nThe course is designed for undergraduates who have previously studied the Bible in Hebrew either in high school or college. It presupposes a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew grammar. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "STUDIES IN HEBREW BIBLE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1226/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-256", "path": "/courses/1226", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1226/sections", "values": [{"name": "STUDIES IN HEBREW BIBLE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-256-401", "path": "/courses/1226/sections/401", "id": "1226-401", "aliases": ["AMES-256-401", "RELS-220-401", "JWST-256-401", "COML-228-401"]}]}, "id": 1226, "aliases": ["AMES-256", "RELS-220", "JWST-256", "COML-228"]}
