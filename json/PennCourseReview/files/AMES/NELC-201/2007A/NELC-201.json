{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4088"}, "description": "This course is team-taught by four professors with specialties in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Turkish literatures. The course deals with the modern literature within each tradition and focuses on poetry, short story and the novel. The readings are all in English. The course is conducted in a seminar format. Students are expected to participate in classroom discussion of the materials assigned for each session, and evaluation is partially based on the quality of that participation. A short paper is assigned on the poetry and the short stories, and there is a final, longer term paper. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14873/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.35", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.12", "rInstructorAccess": "2.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.24", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/14873/sections/401", "id": "14873-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/14873/sections/401/reviews/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "first_name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF", "last_name": "GOLD", "id": "63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF GOLD"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "14873-401-63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.12", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "1.94", "rRecommendMajor": "2.65", "rCourseQuality": "2.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.35", "rInstructorQuality": "2.31"}, "section": {"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/14873/sections/401", "id": "14873-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/14873/sections/401/reviews/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "first_name": "ROGER", "last_name": "ALLEN", "id": "274-ROGER-ALLEN", "name": "ROGER ALLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "14873-401-274-ROGER-ALLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-201", "path": "/courses/14873", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14873/sections", "values": [{"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/14873/sections/401", "id": "14873-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}]}, "id": 14873, "aliases": ["NELC-201", "COML-212"]}
