{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4088"}, "description": "The Middle East boasts a rich tapestry of cultures that have developed a vibrant body of modern literature that is often overlooked in media coverage of the region. While each of the modern literary traditions that will be surveyed in this introductory course-Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Turkish-will be analyzed with an apprreciation of the cultural context unique to each body of literature, this course will also attempt to bridge these diverse traditions by analyzing common themes-such as modernity, social values, the individual and national identity-as reflected in the genres of postry, the novel and the short story. This course is in seminar format to encourage lively discussion and is team-taught by four professors whose expertise in modern Middle Eastern literature serves to create a deeper understanding and aesthetic appreciation of each literary trandition. In addition to honing students' literary analysis skills, the course will enable students to become more adept at discussing the social and political forces that are reflected in Middle Eastern literature, explore important themes and actively engage in reading new Middle Eastern works on their own in translation. All readings are in English. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30719/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.35", "rTAQuality": "3.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401", "id": "30719-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401/reviews/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "first_name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF", "last_name": "GOLD", "id": "63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD", "name": "NILI RACHEL SCHARF GOLD"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30719-401-63-NILI-RACHEL-SCHARF-GOLD"}, {"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.35", "rTAQuality": "3.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.61", "rCommAbility": "3.88", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401", "id": "30719-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401/reviews/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "first_name": "ROGER", "last_name": "ALLEN", "id": "274-ROGER-ALLEN", "name": "ROGER ALLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30719-401-274-ROGER-ALLEN"}, {"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.35", "rTAQuality": "3.63", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.35", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401", "id": "30719-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401/reviews/4475-SYLVIA-ONDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4475-SYLVIA-ONDER", "first_name": "SYLVIA", "last_name": "ONDER", "id": "4475-SYLVIA-ONDER", "name": "SYLVIA ONDER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30719-401-4475-SYLVIA-ONDER"}, {"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.35", "rTAQuality": "3.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorAccess": "2.81"}, "section": {"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401", "id": "30719-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401/reviews/5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD", "first_name": "BLAKE", "last_name": "ATWOOD", "id": "5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD", "name": "BLAKE ATWOOD"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30719-401-5854-BLAKE-ATWOOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-201", "path": "/courses/30719", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30719/sections", "values": [{"name": "MOD MIDEAST LIT IN TRANS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-201-401", "path": "/courses/30719/sections/401", "id": "30719-401", "aliases": ["NELC-201-401", "COML-212-401"]}]}, "id": 30719, "aliases": ["NELC-201", "COML-212"]}
