{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4550"}, "description": "Multiculturalism increasingly characterizes our political, economic, and personal lives. This course will focus on real and perceived differences between the so-called \"East\" and \"West.\" Taking a case study approach, we shall read and compare literary materials from classical Greece and Rome, a major source of \"Western\" culture, and Japan, an \"Eastern\" society. Through analysis of these texts, we shall explore some of the concepts, values, and myths in terms of which \"East\" and \"West\" define themselves and each other: e.g., gender, sexuality, rationality, religion, society, justice, nature, cultural diffusion, work, leisure, life, and death. Readings will include selections from Greco-Roman and Japanese myths, poetry, drama, essays, history, and philosophy. Class format will be lecture with opportunity for questions and discussion. Grading will be based on midterm and final examinations, a short paper, and class participation. No prerequisites. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "\"EAST\"-\"WEST\" CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17188/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.51", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.12", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.78", "rCommAbility": "3.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.74"}, "section": {"name": "\"EAST\"-\"WEST\" CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-005-401", "path": "/courses/17188/sections/401", "id": "17188-401", "aliases": ["EALC-005-401", "CLST-195-401", "ANCH-195-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/17188/sections/401/reviews/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "MCINERNEY", "id": "84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "name": "JEREMY MCINERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "17188-401-84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.51", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.12", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.04", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.78", "rCommAbility": "2.96", "rInstructorQuality": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "\"EAST\"-\"WEST\" CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-005-401", "path": "/courses/17188/sections/401", "id": "17188-401", "aliases": ["EALC-005-401", "CLST-195-401", "ANCH-195-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/17188/sections/401/reviews/258-WILLIAM-R--LAFLEUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/258-WILLIAM-R--LAFLEUR", "first_name": "WILLIAM R.", "last_name": "LAFLEUR", "id": "258-WILLIAM-R--LAFLEUR", "name": "WILLIAM R.
