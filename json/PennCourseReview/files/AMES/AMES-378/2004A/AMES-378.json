{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2707"}, "description": "This course studies the eighteenth-century mastserpiece -- and the most beloved of all Chinese novels -- The Story of the Stone (Shitouji, also known as Hongloumeng, or Dream of the Red Chamber). Because the novel runs to 120 chapters (and five volumes in its sublime English translation), it is rarely taught in its entirety. And yet, of all Chinese novels--it is perhaps the single one most conceived of as a unitary whole. We will be reading the whole novel over the course of the semester. All readings will be in English, and there is no prerequisite. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "UGRAD/GRAD SEM CHINESE: 18THC&STORY OF THE STONE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6094/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "UGRAD/GRAD SEM CHINESE: 18THC&STORY OF THE STONE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-378-401", "path": "/courses/6094/sections/401", "id": "6094-401", "aliases": ["AMES-378-401", "AMES-678-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/6094/sections/401/reviews/1232-TINA-LU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1232-TINA-LU", "first_name": "TINA", "last_name": "LU", "id": "1232-TINA-LU", "name": "TINA LU"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "6094-401-1232-TINA-LU"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-378", "path": "/courses/6094", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6094/sections", "values": [{"name": "UGRAD/GRAD SEM CHINESE: 18THC&STORY OF THE STONE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-378-401", "path": "/courses/6094/sections/401", "id": "6094-401", "aliases": ["AMES-378-401", "AMES-678-401"]}]}, "id": 6094, "aliases": ["AMES-378", "AMES-678"]}
