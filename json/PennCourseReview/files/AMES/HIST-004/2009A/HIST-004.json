{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1335"}, "description": "Asia in a Modern World examines the histories and interactions of the states of Asia from roughly 1600 to the present, laying stress on both internal change and international rivalry and cooperation. Although there are no prerequisites, History 004 is the natural continuation of History 003, Asia in a Wider World. History 004 is intended as an introduction to the fascinating and complex history of Eurasia, taken as a whole, from 1600 to the present. It seeks to make this mass of complex events intelligible by clarifying the interrelationships that bind it together. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ASIA IN A MODERN WORLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15884/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.93", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "2.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.97", "rInstructorAccess": "1.97", "rReadingsValue": "2.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.53", "rCommAbility": "1.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.34"}, "section": {"name": "ASIA IN A MODERN WORLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIST-004-001", "path": "/courses/15884/sections/001", "id": "15884-001", "aliases": ["HIST-004-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/15884/sections/001/reviews/628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON", "first_name": "ARTHUR N.", "last_name": "WALDRON", "id": "628-ARTHUR-N--WALDRON", "name": "ARTHUR N.
