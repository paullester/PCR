{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1911"}, "description": "In this course we will read what many consider to be the greatest book in world literature. This work, Tolstoys War and Peace, is devoted to one of the most momentous periods in world history, the Napoleonic Era (1789-1815). We will study both the novel and the era of the Napoleonic Wars: the military campaigns of Napoleon and his opponents, the grand strategies of the age, political intrigues and diplomatic betrayals, the ideologies and human dramas, the relationship between art and history. How does literature help us to understand this era? How does history help us to understand this great novel? \n\nThis semester marks the 200th anniversary of Napoleons attempt to conquer Russia and achieve world domination, the campaign of 1812. Come celebrate this Bicentennial with us! Because we will read War and Peace over the course of the entire semester, readings will be manageable and very enjoyable. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "HOLOCAUST & SOVIET UNION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3100/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "HOLOCAUST & SOVIET UNION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-333-401", "path": "/courses/3100/sections/401", "id": "3100-401", "aliases": ["HIST-333-401", "JWST-333-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/3100/sections/401/reviews/1508-JOHN-D-KLIER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1508-JOHN-D-KLIER", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "KLIER", "id": "1508-JOHN-D-KLIER", "name": "JOHN D KLIER"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "3100-401-1508-JOHN-D-KLIER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-333", "path": "/courses/3100", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3100/sections", "values": [{"name": "HOLOCAUST & SOVIET UNION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-333-401", "path": "/courses/3100/sections/401", "id": "3100-401", "aliases": ["HIST-333-401", "JWST-333-401"]}]}, "id": 3100, "aliases": ["HIST-333", "JWST-333"]}
