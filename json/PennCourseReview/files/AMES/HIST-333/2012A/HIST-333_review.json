This work, Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace, is devoted to one of the most momentous periods in world history, the Napoleonic Era (1789-1815).  Students study both the novel and the era of the Napoleonic Wars: the military campaigns of Napoleon and his opponents, the grand strategies of the age, political intrigues and diplomatic betrayals, the ideologies and human dramas, the relationship between art and history.  How does literature help us to understand this era?  How does history help us to understand this great novel? \r\n\r\nStudents absolutely raved about the course material and format.  One student mentioned that if they were to begin mentioning all the good things about the course, the student \u201cwould be writing an evaluation whose length would rival War and Peace itself.\u201d  The class integrated both a literary analysis component and a historical component, making it \u201cinnovative.\u201d  \r\n\r\nStudents raved about the dynamic between the two professors.  One student lauded the department for having both a literature and history professor, which \u201cprovided for a more comprehensive, interdisciplinary understanding of War and Peace, which added substantial value to the class.\u201d  The professors \u201cwere constantly engaging with one another, always open to students' questions, and genuinely wanted students to immerse themselves in the Tolstoyan experience.\u201d  Professor Vinitsky was described not only as brilliant, but able to stimulate interest in the material and engage with students during lectures.  \r\n\r\nCoursework included two major written assignments and a handful of quizzes.  The course required weekly reading of between 150-300 pages per week, and students warned that if reading large amounts was difficult for a particular student, he or she may think twice before enrolling in this course.  Overall, students highly recommended this course, in many of their words, \u201cone of the best at Penn.\u201d  One student elaborated, \u201cI recommend this course to anyone, but particularly to freshmen, because it serves as a great inspiration for further courses of a similar nature.\u201d  Another student recommended this course to history and English majors in particular, \u201cif only to meet the professors,\u201d as well as to non-majors looking to expand their breadth of knowledge.
