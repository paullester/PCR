{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3590"}, "description": "The figure of Cleopatra is familiar from modern stories, legends, and film. Was this famous woman a brazen seductress or a brilliant political mind? How many of these presentations are historically accurate? This class will examine the Ptolemaic period in Egypt (305-30 BCE), the time period during which Cleopatra lived, in an attempt to separate myth from reality. The Ptolemaic period is filled with political and personal intrigue. It was also a time of dynamic multiculturalism. Arguably one of the most violent and fascinating eras in ancient Egyptian history, the Ptolemaic period is largely unknown and often misunderstood. This course will examine the history, art, religion and literature of Egypt's Ptolemaic period which culminated in the reign of Cleopatra VII. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "THE WORLD OF CLEOPATRA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9940/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "1.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "1.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "THE WORLD OF CLEOPATRA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-064-401", "path": "/courses/9940/sections/401", "id": "9940-401", "aliases": ["AMES-064-401", "AMES-464-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/9940/sections/401/reviews/34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "first_name": "JENNIFER R.", "last_name": "HOUSER", "id": "34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "name": "JENNIFER R.
