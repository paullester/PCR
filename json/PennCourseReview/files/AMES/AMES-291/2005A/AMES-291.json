{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3599"}, "description": "From new things and new styles to new concepts and new morals, \"new\" was the craze in East Asia during the first few decades of the 20th century. In this milieu of dizzying changes and expansions, the new woman took center stage. One area in which the new woman became the subject of preoccupation was in the literary arts field where she graced the pages of fiction, poetry, drama, and film as heroine, villain, femme fatale, vixen, etc. Simultaneously, the new woman became an object of intense debate and conversation from which revealed the deep tensions holding together the extraordinary changes taking place. In this course we will explore who this new woman was, what was so \"new\" about her, and what can be said about the new literature accompanying her. By placing her in a broader context of the growing political economy and side by side with the development of modern print culture, we will examine more closely how the categories of women's literature, feminist literature and gender in literature complicate and inform the development of modern literature, especially in East Asia. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "NEW WOMAN/NEW LIT-E.ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9985/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "NEW WOMAN/NEW LIT-E.ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-291-401", "path": "/courses/9985/sections/401", "id": "9985-401", "aliases": ["AMES-291-401", "WSTD-291-401", "AMES-691-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/9985/sections/401/reviews/2396-JINA-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2396-JINA-KIM", "first_name": "JINA", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "2396-JINA-KIM", "name": "JINA KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "9985-401-2396-JINA-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-291", "path": "/courses/9985", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9985/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEW WOMAN/NEW LIT-E.ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-291-401", "path": "/courses/9985/sections/401", "id": "9985-401", "aliases": ["AMES-291-401", "WSTD-291-401", "AMES-691-401"]}]}, "id": 9985, "aliases": ["AMES-291", "WSTD-291", "AMES-691"]}
