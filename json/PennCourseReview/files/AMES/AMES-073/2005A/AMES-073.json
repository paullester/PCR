{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/43"}, "description": "This is a two-semester course, covering the same material as the four-semester AMES 074 and AMES 174. The main objective of the course is to help students build a solid foundation of the four basic skills--listening, speaking, reading, and writing Chinese. By the end of two semesters, students should achive the following goals: 1) pronounce all the sounds in Mandarin Chinese accurately and comfortably with a good command of the four tones; 2) carry out basic conversations in daily activities; 3) recognize and reproduce approximately 600-650 characters; and 4) read edited simple stories and write short notes or letters. Grammatical and cultural related issues are discussed during lecture hours. Oral communication tasks are given every week. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "INTEN BEGINNING CHINESE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9944/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.30", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.50", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.70", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rInstructorConcern": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rClassPace": "2.50", "rExamsConsistent": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rGradeFairness": "2.80", "rArticulateGoals": "3.30", "rOralSkills": "3.00", "rNativeAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.70", "rInstructorEffective": "3.10", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTEN BEGINNING CHINESE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "AMES-073-002", "path": "/courses/9944/sections/002", "id": "9944-002", "aliases": ["AMES-073-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/9944/sections/002/reviews/43-YANFENG-LI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/43-YANFENG-LI", "first_name": "YANFENG", "last_name": "LI", "id": "43-YANFENG-LI", "name": "YANFENG LI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "9944-002-43-YANFENG-LI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-073", "path": "/courses/9944", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9944/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEN BEGINNING CHINESE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "AMES-073-002", "path": "/courses/9944/sections/002", "id": "9944-002", "aliases": ["AMES-073-002"]}]}, "id": 9944, "aliases": ["AMES-073"]}
