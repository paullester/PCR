The course will conclude with a discussion of the legacy of the samurai in modern Japanese culture and the image of the samurai in foreign perceptions of Japan. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4909/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.63", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.94", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AMES-296-601", "path": "/courses/4909/sections/601", "id": "4909-601", "aliases": ["AMES-296-601", "AMES-696-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/4909/sections/601/reviews/70-G--CAMERON-HURST", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/70-G--CAMERON-HURST", "first_name": "G.
