{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/85"}, "description": "This text-based course will concentrate on two enigmatic bodies of medieval Arabic writings: the vast corpus attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, and the Rasa'il of the khwan al-Safa'. A small selection from th two corpora will be made with a view to examining the nature of the particular kind of esotericism practiced by the two sets of authors, and to study, both textually and substantively, their discourses on the theory and practice of different forms of arts and crafts, their natural scientific doctrines, and the metaphysical foundations of their system which binds these strands together. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "READINGS IN ISLAMICS: Arts, Crafts & Science in Esoteric Arabic Literature", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/85/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.67", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "READINGS IN ISLAMICS: Arts, Crafts & Science in Esoteric Arabic Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-430-401", "path": "/courses/85/sections/401", "id": "85-401", "aliases": ["AMES-430-401", "ARTH-433-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/85/sections/401/reviews/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "first_name": "S.
