{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3731"}, "description": "Is Korean cinema experiencing a \"renaissance\" in the 21st century? We will take the recent surge of success behind Korean cinema as a way to explore our object of study: Korea and the cinema. We situate Korean cinema in broader (and at times narrow) cultural, social, and aesthetic contexts to investigate transnational media production and circulation, globalization, consumer culture, commercialization, Hollywoodization, and construction of national, ethnic, gender identities, etc. The course focuses on the works of prominent filmmakers of Korea's past and present, such as Shin Sangok, Im Kwontaek, Kim Kiduk, and Lee Ch'angdong, as well as paying special attention to genres of Korean film such as the melodrama, slapstick comedy, and erotica. No prerequisites. All films with English subtitles. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "KOREAN FILM & CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14314/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.56", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.19", "rInstructorQuality": "2.44"}, "section": {"name": "KOREAN FILM & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-186-401", "path": "/courses/14314/sections/401", "id": "14314-401", "aliases": ["EALC-186-401", "COML-186-401", "EALC-586-401", "CINE-221-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/14314/sections/401/reviews/2396-JINA-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2396-JINA-KIM", "first_name": "JINA", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "2396-JINA-KIM", "name": "JINA KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "14314-401-2396-JINA-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-186", "path": "/courses/14314", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14314/sections", "values": [{"name": "KOREAN FILM & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-186-401", "path": "/courses/14314/sections/401", "id": "14314-401", "aliases": ["EALC-186-401", "COML-186-401", "EALC-586-401", "CINE-221-401"]}]}, "id": 14314, "aliases": ["EALC-186", "COML-186", "EALC-586", "CINE-221"]}
