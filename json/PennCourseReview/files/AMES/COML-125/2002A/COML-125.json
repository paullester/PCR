{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/289"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/289/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.72", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.46", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "COML-125-402", "path": "/courses/289/sections/402", "id": "289-402", "aliases": ["COML-125-402", "AMES-135-402", "ENGL-103-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/289/sections/402/reviews/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "first_name": "ROGER", "last_name": "ALLEN", "id": "274-ROGER-ALLEN", "name": "ROGER ALLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 54, "id": "289-402-274-ROGER-ALLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-125", "path": "/courses/289", "sections": {"path": "/courses/289/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "COML-125-402", "path": "/courses/289/sections/402", "id": "289-402", "aliases": ["COML-125-402", "AMES-135-402", "ENGL-103-402"]}]}, "id": 289, "aliases": ["COML-125", "AMES-135", "ENGL-103"]}
