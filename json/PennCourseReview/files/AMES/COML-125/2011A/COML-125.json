{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/289"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21493/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "2.09", "rStimulateInterest": "2.48", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.59", "rReadingsValue": "2.85", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.53", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.95"}, "section": {"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/21493/sections/401", "id": "21493-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "ENGL-103-401", "FOLK-125-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/21493/sections/401/reviews/1462-GERALD-J-PRINCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1462-GERALD-J-PRINCE", "first_name": "GERALD J", "last_name": "PRINCE", "id": "1462-GERALD-J-PRINCE", "name": "GERALD J PRINCE"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "21493-401-1462-GERALD-J-PRINCE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-125", "path": "/courses/21493", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21493/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/21493/sections/401", "id": "21493-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "ENGL-103-401", "FOLK-125-401"]}]}, "id": 21493, "aliases": ["COML-125", "ENGL-103", "FOLK-125"]}
