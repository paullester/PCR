{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/289"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25831/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.04", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "2.98", "rReadingsValue": "3.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.95", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/25831/sections/401", "id": "25831-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "ENGL-103-401", "NELC-180-401", "FOLK-125-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 62, "path": "/courses/25831/sections/401/reviews/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/274-ROGER-ALLEN", "first_name": "ROGER", "last_name": "ALLEN", "id": "274-ROGER-ALLEN", "name": "ROGER ALLEN"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "25831-401-274-ROGER-ALLEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-125", "path": "/courses/25831", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25831/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/25831/sections/401", "id": "25831-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "ENGL-103-401", "NELC-180-401", "FOLK-125-401"]}]}, "id": 25831, "aliases": ["COML-125", "ENGL-103", "NELC-180", "FOLK-125"]}
