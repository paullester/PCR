{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/289"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30096/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.85", "rTAQuality": "1.25", "rStimulateInterest": "1.54", "rCourseQuality": "1.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "1.64", "rCommAbility": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/30096/sections/401", "id": "30096-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "FOLK-125-401", "NELC-180-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30096/sections/401/reviews/1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS", "first_name": "DAN", "last_name": "BEN-AMOS", "id": "1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS", "name": "DAN BEN-AMOS"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "30096-401-1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-125", "path": "/courses/30096", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30096/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/30096/sections/401", "id": "30096-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "FOLK-125-401", "NELC-180-401"]}]}, "id": 30096, "aliases": ["COML-125", "FOLK-125", "NELC-180"]}
