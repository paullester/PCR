{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/289"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15529/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.64", "rDifficulty": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "1.18", "rRecommendMajor": "1.77", "rCourseQuality": "1.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.41", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "1.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.86", "rCommAbility": "1.68", "rInstructorQuality": "1.81"}, "section": {"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/15529/sections/401", "id": "15529-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "ENGL-103-401", "FOLK-125-401", "NELC-180-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/15529/sections/401/reviews/1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS", "first_name": "DAN", "last_name": "BEN-AMOS", "id": "1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS", "name": "DAN BEN-AMOS"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "15529-401-1235-DAN-BEN-AMOS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COML-125", "path": "/courses/15529", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15529/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COML-125-401", "path": "/courses/15529/sections/401", "id": "15529-401", "aliases": ["COML-125-401", "ENGL-103-401", "FOLK-125-401", "NELC-180-401"]}]}, "id": 15529, "aliases": ["COML-125", "ENGL-103", "FOLK-125", "NELC-180"]}
