{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/980"}, "description": "The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has revolutionized our knowledge of ancient Judaism in the centuries between the Torah and the Mishnah. This course explores the significance of these works for understanding the formation and early interpretation of the Hebrew Bible; the development of Jewish liturgy, law, \"science,\" and \"magic\"; the development of Jewish and Christian beliefs about the afterlife, end of time, and the messiah; and the history of Israel between the Maccabean Revolt to the first Jewish Revolt against Rome - as well as the shared background of Judaism and Christianity. Readings will include biblical commentaries, parabiblical literature, works about community life, predictions about the end of time, prayers and and poetry, halakhic discussions, and exorcistic incantations and horoscopes. We will also grapple with the challenges of correlating this literary with archaeological data. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "DEAD SEA SCROLLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/980/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.80", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "DEAD SEA SCROLLS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-225-401", "path": "/courses/980/sections/401", "id": "980-401", "aliases": ["RELS-225-401", "AMES-250-401", "JWST-225-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/980/sections/401/reviews/1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT", "first_name": "ROBERT A", "last_name": "KRAFT", "id": "1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT", "name": "ROBERT A KRAFT"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "980-401-1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-225", "path": "/courses/980", "sections": {"path": "/courses/980/sections", "values": [{"name": "DEAD SEA SCROLLS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-225-401", "path": "/courses/980/sections/401", "id": "980-401", "aliases": ["RELS-225-401", "AMES-250-401", "JWST-225-401"]}]}, "id": 980, "aliases": ["RELS-225", "AMES-250", "JWST-225"]}
