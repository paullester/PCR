{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2458"}, "description": "This course will focus on the reading of Korean literature and criticism in translation. We will investigate the \"materialization\" of modern urban literature in Colonial Korea and ask what kinds of historical, cultural and gender shifts occurred as a result of modern material objects and spatial practices. How did the new urban geographical spatial practices shape the space of language and literature and vice versa? How can we start to theorize about the burgeoning genre of \"urban\" literature in colonial Korea and what does this mean for the development of literary modernity/modernism in Korea? It is recommended that graduate students have reading knowledge of Korean and may benefit from reading some of the texts in the original Korean and engage in a more substantial research project using primary sources. \n\nThe course will cover advantages and disadvantages, symmetries and asymmetries of the Korean business firms in the international business arena. Those to be discussed in the course with particular significance will include the issues of Asian values and business, Chaebols and the economy, and the relationship betwen government and business. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "NARRAT COLONIAL KOREA: Urban Literature and City Narratives of Colonial Korea", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "NARRAT COLONIAL KOREA: Urban Literature and City Narratives of Colonial Korea", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-589-301", "path": "/courses/4941/sections/301", "id": "4941-301", "aliases": ["AMES-589-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/4941/sections/301/reviews/2396-JINA-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2396-JINA-KIM", "first_name": "JINA", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "2396-JINA-KIM", "name": "JINA KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "4941-301-2396-JINA-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-589", "path": "/courses/4941", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4941/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRAT COLONIAL KOREA: Urban Literature and City Narratives of Colonial Korea", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-589-301", "path": "/courses/4941/sections/301", "id": "4941-301", "aliases": ["AMES-589-301"]}]}, "id": 4941, "aliases": ["AMES-589"]}
