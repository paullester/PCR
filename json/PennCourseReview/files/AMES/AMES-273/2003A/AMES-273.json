{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1178"}, "description": "The I CHING is a storehouse of symbols for reflecting on human experience which were collected during a formative phase of Chinese. This course will examine systems of interpretation which grew up around that body of symbols. Starting with the oracular statements of the original text, we will discuss their expansion into ethical and cosmological areas of meaning in the Ten Treatises. We will discuss selections from the later commentarial tradition, including works by Wang Bi, Cheng Yi, and Zhu Xi. Along the way we will address these questions: 1) In what ways is our understanding of the core text problematic? 2) Do the Ten Treatises represent a valid extension of ideas implicit in the original text? 3) How is the symbol system of the I CHING constructed, and how is it thought to offer insight into the unfolding of natural processes? 4) In what way was this text traditionally thought to be a means of self-cultivation? 5) To what extent does the text contain its own system of thought, and to what extent has it been a platform for the elaboration of other systems? \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "I CHING SEMINAR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1232/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-273", "path": "/courses/1232", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1232/sections", "values": [{"name": "I CHING SEMINAR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AMES-273-401", "path": "/courses/1232/sections/401", "id": "1232-401", "aliases": ["AMES-273-401", "AMES-573-401"]}]}, "id": 1232, "aliases": ["AMES-273", "AMES-573"]}
