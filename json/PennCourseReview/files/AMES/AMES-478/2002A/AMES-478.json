{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/92"}, "description": "This seminar covers the span of Chinese history from the Bronze Age to the establishment of the empire in 221 B.C. The course is divided into four units of different length. The first examines the beginnings of Chinese history and historiography in the Shang Dynasty. Next we move to the Chou conquest and the new state and society of the Western Chou. The third section of the course is devoted to readings from the Tso chuan, a classical chronicle of the years 722 to 468 B.C., which documents the political disintegration of Chou rule in the period known as the Springs and Autumns. Finally, we study the rise of the state of Ch'in, the statelet that came to unify all of China under the First Emperor. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "EARLY CHINESE HISTORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/92/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "EARLY CHINESE HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-478-301", "path": "/courses/92/sections/301", "id": "92-301", "aliases": ["AMES-478-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/92/sections/301/reviews/66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN", "first_name": "PAUL RAKITA", "last_name": "GOLDIN", "id": "66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN", "name": "PAUL RAKITA GOLDIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "92-301-66-PAUL-RAKITA-GOLDIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AMES-478", "path": "/courses/92", "sections": {"path": "/courses/92/sections", "values": [{"name": "EARLY CHINESE HISTORY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AMES-478-301", "path": "/courses/92/sections/301", "id": "92-301", "aliases": ["AMES-478-301"]}]}, "id": 92, "aliases": ["AMES-478"]}
