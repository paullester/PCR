It will include both monumental inscriptions, such as autobiographical stela inscriptions (P. Newberry, BENI HASSAN) and stelae (Seth, LESESTUCKE) as well as narratives in prose (DeBuck, READING BOOK). Religious texts (ibid. and COFFIN TEXTS) will also be studied and analyzed. Distinctions between the grammar of the literary and non-literary genres will be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "MIDDLE EGYPTIAN TEXTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28506/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "MIDDLE EGYPTIAN TEXTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANEL-461-001", "path": "/courses/28506/sections/001", "id": "28506-001", "aliases": ["ANEL-461-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/28506/sections/001/reviews/75-DAVID-P-SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/75-DAVID-P-SILVERMAN", "first_name": "DAVID P", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "75-DAVID-P-SILVERMAN", "name": "DAVID P SILVERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "28506-001-75-DAVID-P-SILVERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANEL-461", "path": "/courses/28506", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28506/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIDDLE EGYPTIAN TEXTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ANEL-461-001", "path": "/courses/28506/sections/001", "id": "28506-001", "aliases": ["ANEL-461-001"]}]}, "id": 28506, "aliases": ["ANEL-461"]}
