{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1378"}, "description": "This course is designed to provide you with opportunities to develop the intellectual and practical tools and skills crucial to teaching Jewish texts. We will focus on two main questions over the course of the semester. First, what does learning entail, and what does it mean to \"know\" something? Second, what do teachers need to do to prepare content for teaching? How is this different from what one does to learn content oneself? How do teachers move from thinking about content, to designing lessons, to creating ways to assess their students? This course will focus on the teaching of Humash and rabbinic texts. The ability to read these texts in the original is strongly desirable. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "TEACHING JEWISH TEXTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6741/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.57", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "TEACHING JEWISH TEXTS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "JWST-200-401", "path": "/courses/6741/sections/401", "id": "6741-401", "aliases": ["JWST-200-401", "EDUC-200-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/6741/sections/401/reviews/1878-RUTH-S--FAGEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1878-RUTH-S--FAGEN", "first_name": "RUTH S.", "last_name": "FAGEN", "id": "1878-RUTH-S--FAGEN", "name": "RUTH S.
