{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/917"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is simple enough: to familiarize you with the major problems and dilemmas of contemporary international politics, and in the process to enhance your understanding of a range of complex issues ranging from the evolving nature of international conflict and rivalry to the revival of nationalism; to provide an informed acquaintance with the determinants of foreign policy; to encourage (and prod) thinking about national security and foreign policy at a time of revolutionary changes and explore a variety of perspectives from which they may be viewed and evaluated; and, in particular to examine more closely the role of moral considerations in political choices. There are no prerequisites for the course, which is intended as much for the politically illiterate as for the politically informed. However, students must be prepared to read, to be critical, and to examine their own position of issues that have no easy or apparent solutions. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "LECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/917/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rStimulateInterest": "2.58", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "2.81", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "2.86", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-050-001", "path": "/courses/917/sections/001", "id": "917-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-050-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/917/sections/001/reviews/991-JOHN-D-HARRINGTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/991-JOHN-D-HARRINGTON", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "HARRINGTON", "id": "991-JOHN-D-HARRINGTON", "name": "JOHN D HARRINGTON"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "917-001-991-JOHN-D-HARRINGTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-050", "path": "/courses/917", "sections": {"path": "/courses/917/sections", "values": [{"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-050-001", "path": "/courses/917/sections/001", "id": "917-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-050-001"]}]}, "id": 917, "aliases": ["PSCI-050"]}
