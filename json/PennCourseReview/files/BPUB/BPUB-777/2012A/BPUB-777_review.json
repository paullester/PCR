For government, whose \"products\" are rarely sold, the valuation of costs and benefits by means alternative to market prices is necessary. It is the counterpart to cost accounting in private firms and provides guidance for avoiding wasteful projects and undertaking those that are worthwhile. In addition, given government regulations, cost benefit evaluations are critical for many private sector activities. Real estate developers, manufacturing firms, employers of all types are required to provide evaluations of environmental impacts and of urban impacts for their proposed projects. They too must engage in cost benefit analysis, in the valuation of social benefits and costs. Government analysts, consultants, and private firms regularly carry out cost benefit analyses for major investments -- bridges, roads, transit systems, convention centers, sports stadia, dams -- as well as for regulatory activities -- OSHA workplace safety regulations and the Clean Air Act are two important examples. PhD students will write a paper on a theoretical or applied issue in cost-benefit analysis in lieu of the final examination.
