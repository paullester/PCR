{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4174"}, "description": "Financing and Managing Government: This course studies the role of public policy in efficiency of markets and the distribution of resources in society. The first goal of the course is to survey public expenditure programs and their interaction with markets. The second goal is to discuss how the public sector raises revenue through taxation to finance these expenditure programs. The course is divided into three parts. After an overview of the tools of public finance, we study public goods and externalities. Next, we move to studying social insurance and income maintenance. The course concludes a segment on multi-government public finance, studying the interactions of local, state and national government in a federal system. Given government regulations, cost benefit evaluatoins are critical for many private sector activities. This course will explore cost-benefit analysis and the costs and benefits of major public tax and spending policies. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21373/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.15", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "1.74", "rRecommendMajor": "2.26", "rCourseQuality": "1.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorAccess": "2.52", "rReadingsValue": "1.59", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "1.89", "rInstructorQuality": "1.97"}, "section": {"name": "COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-777-401", "path": "/courses/21373/sections/401", "id": "21373-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-777-401", "BPUB-960-401", "BPUB-204-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/21373/sections/401/reviews/3478-RICHARD-P-VOITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3478-RICHARD-P-VOITH", "first_name": "RICHARD P", "last_name": "VOITH", "id": "3478-RICHARD-P-VOITH", "name": "RICHARD P VOITH"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "21373-401-3478-RICHARD-P-VOITH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-777", "path": "/courses/21373", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21373/sections", "values": [{"name": "COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-777-401", "path": "/courses/21373/sections/401", "id": "21373-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-777-401", "BPUB-960-401", "BPUB-204-401"]}]}, "id": 21373, "aliases": ["BPUB-777", "BPUB-960", "BPUB-204"]}
