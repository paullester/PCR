{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4612"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to develop students' abilities to apply game theory to decision making. Development of the tools of game theory and the application of those tools is emphasized. Game theory has become an important tool for managers and consultants in analyzing and implementing tactical as well as strategic actions. This course will primarily focus on examples useful for developing competitive strategy in the private sector (pricing and product strategy, capacity choices, contracting and negotiating, signaling and bluffing, takeover strategy, etc.). Game theory can also be used to address problems relevant to a firm's organizational strategy (e.g., internal incentives and information flow within a firm) and to a firm's non-market environment (e.g., strategic trade policies, litigation and regulation strategy). \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23428/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.06", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "1.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.14", "rCourseQuality": "0.89", "rWorkRequired": "1.59", "rInstructorAccess": "1.70", "rReadingsValue": "1.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.95", "rCommAbility": "1.08", "rInstructorQuality": "1.14"}, "section": {"name": "MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MGMT-784-401", "path": "/courses/23428/sections/401", "id": "23428-401", "aliases": ["MGMT-784-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/23428/sections/401/reviews/1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "first_name": "LOUIS A", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "name": "LOUIS A THOMAS"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "23428-401-1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "0.91", "rDifficulty": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "0.91", "rRecommendMajor": "0.97", "rCourseQuality": "0.94", "rWorkRequired": "1.12", "rInstructorAccess": "2.06", "rReadingsValue": "1.32", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.68", "rCommAbility": "1.03", "rInstructorQuality": "1.09"}, "section": {"name": "MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME", "sectionnum": "403", "primary_alias": "MGMT-784-403", "path": "/courses/23428/sections/403", "id": "23428-403", "aliases": ["MGMT-784-403"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/23428/sections/403/reviews/1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "first_name": "LOUIS A", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "name": "LOUIS A THOMAS"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "23428-403-1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-784", "path": "/courses/23428", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23428/sections", "values": [{"name": "MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MGMT-784-401", "path": "/courses/23428/sections/401", "id": "23428-401", "aliases": ["MGMT-784-401"]}, {"name": "MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME", "sectionnum": "403", "primary_alias": "MGMT-784-403", "path": "/courses/23428/sections/403", "id": "23428-403", "aliases": ["MGMT-784-403"]}]}, "id": 23428, "aliases": ["MGMT-784"]}
