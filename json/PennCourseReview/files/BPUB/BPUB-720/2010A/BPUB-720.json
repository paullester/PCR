{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4172"}, "description": "This class considers an intriguing and growing set of non-traditional markets, including trading (or gambling) on the outcome of sporting events, elections, political risks, corporate outcomes, public policy and economic statistics. We will explore these markets, drawing on insights from economics and psychology, and highlighting the parallels between these markets and other existing markets. We will examine the potential uses of these markets in the business and public policy domains. Importantly, the success of these markets depends on whether these markets yield efficient forecasts, which in turn depends on factors such as market design, and the biases exhibited by individual traders. We then turn to discussing recent advances in behavioral economics and attempt to apply psychologically-grounded theories of information processing to a particular set of prediction markets: sports betting. Assessing potentially profitable trading strategies with a critical eye, we will discuss not only investment opportunities, but what these findings reveal about both human psychology and the operation of markets. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25721/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.21", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.03", "rRecommendMajor": "2.68", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.91", "rInstructorAccess": "2.76", "rReadingsValue": "2.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.09", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BPUB-720-001", "path": "/courses/25721/sections/001", "id": "25721-001", "aliases": ["BPUB-720-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/25721/sections/001/reviews/4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS", "first_name": "JUSTIN", "last_name": "WOLFERS", "id": "4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS", "name": "JUSTIN WOLFERS"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "25721-001-4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.36", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "2.68", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.61", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "BPUB-720-002", "path": "/courses/25721/sections/002", "id": "25721-002", "aliases": ["BPUB-720-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/25721/sections/002/reviews/4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS", "first_name": "JUSTIN", "last_name": "WOLFERS", "id": "4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS", "name": "JUSTIN WOLFERS"}, "num_reviewers": 31, "id": "25721-002-4268-JUSTIN-WOLFERS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-720", "path": "/courses/25721", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25721/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BPUB-720-001", "path": "/courses/25721/sections/001", "id": "25721-001", "aliases": ["BPUB-720-001"]}, {"name": "BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "BPUB-720-002", "path": "/courses/25721/sections/002", "id": "25721-002", "aliases": ["BPUB-720-002"]}]}, "id": 25721, "aliases": ["BPUB-720"]}
