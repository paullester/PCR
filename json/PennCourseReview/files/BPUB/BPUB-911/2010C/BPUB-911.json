{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4175"}, "description": "This course examines econometric research on a variety of topics related to public policy, with the goal of preparing students to undertake academic-caliber research. The course is not an econometrics or statistics course per se; rather, it focuses on research designs with observational data and how econometric techniques are applied in practice. The course aims to train students to do applied economic research that involves measuring effects of theoretical or practical interest. It proceeds in two major parts. The first part examines endogeneity and inference about causal relationships, instrumental variables methods and critiques, and panel data methods. The second part of the course addresses 'structural' econometric modeling. Topics covered in this part include sorting and selection, entry models, and counterfactual analyses of policy changes. The course proceeds by analyzing, in detail, approximately 24 well-known empirical research papers in applied economics or related fields. These include public economics and tax policy, labor economics, law and economics, health care policy, industrial organization and competition, transportation demand and policy, and others. \n\nThe course is participatory in nature. Students are required to prepare research proposals and to complete an empirical research paper that can develop into (part of) a dissertation. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "EMPIRICAL PUBLIC POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22747/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "EMPIRICAL PUBLIC POLICY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BPUB-911-001", "path": "/courses/22747/sections/001", "id": "22747-001", "aliases": ["BPUB-911-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/22747/sections/001/reviews/5302-ULRICH-DORASZELSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5302-ULRICH-DORASZELSKI", "first_name": "ULRICH", "last_name": "DORASZELSKI", "id": "5302-ULRICH-DORASZELSKI", "name": "ULRICH DORASZELSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "22747-001-5302-ULRICH-DORASZELSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-911", "path": "/courses/22747", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22747/sections", "values": [{"name": "EMPIRICAL PUBLIC POLICY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BPUB-911-001", "path": "/courses/22747/sections/001", "id": "22747-001", "aliases": ["BPUB-911-001"]}]}, "id": 22747, "aliases": ["BPUB-911"]}
