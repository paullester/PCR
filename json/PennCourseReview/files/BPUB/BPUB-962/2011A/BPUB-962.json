{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4899"}, "description": "The goal of this course is to help doctoral students develop critical thinking skills through both seminar participation and writing of referee reports. To this end students will attend the Wharton Applied Economics each Wednesday at noon seminar when it meets; prepare two written referee reports on WAE papers per semester, due before the seminar is presented; after attending the seminar - and the ensuing discussion of the paper - students will prepare follow-up evaluations of their referee report reports, due one week after the seminar. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "APPLIED ECONOMICS SEM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21376/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "1.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "APPLIED ECONOMICS SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BPUB-962-301", "path": "/courses/21376/sections/301", "id": "21376-301", "aliases": ["BPUB-962-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/21376/sections/301/reviews/3234-ROBERT-P--INMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3234-ROBERT-P--INMAN", "first_name": "ROBERT P.", "last_name": "INMAN", "id": "3234-ROBERT-P--INMAN", "name": "ROBERT P.
