{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2485"}, "description": "The course analyzes the problems of emerging markets. The course considers the industrialization strategies they have chosen and the recent financial and macroeconomic problems they have encountered. Particular emphasis will be given to the recent problems of Latin American and Asian countries that experienced rapid growth for considerable periods only to encounter major reversals in the last half of the 1990s. The implications of this experience for the private and public sectors will be considered in detail. The role of foreign aid, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in dealing with crises in developing countries will be explored in detail. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "INT IND DEV STRA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25720/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.21", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.35", "rInstructorQuality": "3.28"}, "section": {"name": "INT IND DEV STRA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-288-401", "path": "/courses/25720/sections/401", "id": "25720-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-288-401", "BPUB-788-401", "BPUB-988-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/25720/sections/401/reviews/1806-HOWARD-PACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1806-HOWARD-PACK", "first_name": "HOWARD", "last_name": "PACK", "id": "1806-HOWARD-PACK", "name": "HOWARD PACK"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "25720-401-1806-HOWARD-PACK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-288", "path": "/courses/25720", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25720/sections", "values": [{"name": "INT IND DEV STRA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-288-401", "path": "/courses/25720/sections/401", "id": "25720-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-288-401", "BPUB-788-401", "BPUB-988-401"]}]}, "id": 25720, "aliases": ["BPUB-288", "BPUB-788", "BPUB-988"]}
