{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/234"}, "description": "The environment of business has market and non market components. The market component is characterized by the economics of an industry and a firm's position in it. The nonmarket component is broader political, regulatory, legal and civil context in which companies function. In four portions, this course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions, the law, and the public. The first portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The second portion examines the messier realities of \"political economy\" and the actual making of lawsand regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. Third, the course addresses more squarely the ways that firms and managers can and do shape their nonmarket environments, as well as tools to help managers think through related nonmarket decisions. In the fourth portion we will cover topics in financial regulation. Successful business leadership requires strategic thinking not only about market factors, but also about political, regulatory, public and other nonmarket factors. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8616/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "1.68", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.35", "rWorkRequired": "1.82", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "1.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.85", "rCommAbility": "2.93", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BPUB-203-001", "path": "/courses/8616/sections/001", "id": "8616-001", "aliases": ["BPUB-203-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 73, "path": "/courses/8616/sections/001/reviews/212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY", "first_name": "ELIZABETH E", "last_name": "BAILEY", "id": "212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY", "name": "ELIZABETH E BAILEY"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "8616-001-212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "1.96", "rStimulateInterest": "2.04", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.02", "rReadingsValue": "1.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.91", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "BPUB-203-002", "path": "/courses/8616/sections/002", "id": "8616-002", "aliases": ["BPUB-203-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 66, "path": "/courses/8616/sections/002/reviews/212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY", "first_name": "ELIZABETH E", "last_name": "BAILEY", "id": "212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY", "name": "ELIZABETH E BAILEY"}, "num_reviewers": 56, "id": "8616-002-212-ELIZABETH-E-BAILEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-203", "path": "/courses/8616", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8616/sections", "values": [{"name": "BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BPUB-203-001", "path": "/courses/8616/sections/001", "id": "8616-001", "aliases": ["BPUB-203-001"]}, {"name": "BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "BPUB-203-002", "path": "/courses/8616/sections/002", "id": "8616-002", "aliases": ["BPUB-203-002"]}]}, "id": 8616, "aliases": ["BPUB-203"]}
