{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5186"}, "description": "This course develops a formal approach to the study of industrial organization: it analyzes the behavior of firms, the structure of markets, and the role of public policy in protecting the interests of consumers and ensuring market competition. The first goal of the course is to develop the basic intuition for pricing and other forms of strategic behavior on the part of firms when faced with complex patterns of consumer demand and strategic competitors. The second goal is to use the theoretical insights to analyze the economic underpinnings of select antitrust cases and public policy design. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "FIRMS, MARKETS & PUBLIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24086/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.21", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "1.64", "rRecommendMajor": "2.15", "rCourseQuality": "2.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.07", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "1.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "1.86", "rInstructorQuality": "2.07"}, "section": {"name": "FIRMS, MARKETS & PUBLIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-210-401", "path": "/courses/24086/sections/401", "id": "24086-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-210-401", "BPUB-710-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/24086/sections/401/reviews/5715-LISA-M-GEORGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5715-LISA-M-GEORGE", "first_name": "LISA M", "last_name": "GEORGE", "id": "5715-LISA-M-GEORGE", "name": "LISA M GEORGE"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "24086-401-5715-LISA-M-GEORGE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-210", "path": "/courses/24086", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24086/sections", "values": [{"name": "FIRMS, MARKETS & PUBLIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-210-401", "path": "/courses/24086/sections/401", "id": "24086-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-210-401", "BPUB-710-401"]}]}, "id": 24086, "aliases": ["BPUB-210", "BPUB-710"]}
