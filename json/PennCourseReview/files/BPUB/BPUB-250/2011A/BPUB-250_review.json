Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. The goal of this course is to get students to internalize this body of theory well enough so that they can analyze management problems. While this is a \"tools course\", the lectures will be mindful of applied business problems throughout the course. After presenting the competitive model the course will dwell on other market structures more like those encountered by typical firms (monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition). The lectures will spend some time on microeconomic lessons on the development and use of market power, as well as strategic interaction among firms. Finally, the course will spend some time on the theory of market failure. &#8232;Students need to have taken or waived introductory economics (e.g. Econ 001/010). Students must also be familiar with simple calculus (which makes this course much easier). &#8232;&#8232;Students agreed that the course material was both \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d. However, due to the slow pace of the class, students reported that \u201clectures can be a bit dull\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d. Students appreciated Professor Asher\u2019s thoroughness in lectures and commented that the slow pace \u201cprobably isn\u2019t his fault\u201d but rather a result of the material that needed to be covered throughout the course. &#8232;&#8232;Overall, students commented that Professor Asher is \u201ckind and dedicated\u201d and \u201ccares about students and wants to do a good job.\u201d One student wrote ,\u201cProfessor Asher\u2019s genuine interest in the material is exceptional.\u201d Students felt that Professor Asher was \u201cvery good\u201d at communicating the subject matter to the class, and lends students \u201can incredible understanding of the material.\u201d Professor Asher was very accessible during office hours and \u201cwas very helpful and clear in answering questions and clarifying any confusions.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;This course is intended for Wharton students with a background in economics and basic calculus. Some students mentioned that textbook reading was not required for good performance in the course. One student criticized the participation portion of the course, saying it emphasized \u201cquantity, not quality\u201d. Grading is otherwise based on several quizzes and two exams, and \u201cvery little official work\u201d such as \u201cshort problem sets.\u201d", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/21372/sections/003/reviews/1427-MARTIN-A--ASHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1427-MARTIN-A--ASHER", "first_name": "MARTIN A.", "last_name": "ASHER", "id": "1427-MARTIN-A--ASHER", "name": "MARTIN A.
