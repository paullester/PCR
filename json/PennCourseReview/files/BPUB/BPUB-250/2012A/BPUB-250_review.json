Microeconomic theory is a highly useful set of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. The goal in this course is to help students understand this body of theory so they can analyze private and public management problems in an economic framework. This is a \"tools\" course, but the course will discuss many business applications and offer a strong emphasis on prescription, as opposed to description. For example, the course will focus on profit maximization as a management objective rather than simply a foregone conclusion. The term begins with a brief introduction of the theory of supply and demand underlying the competitive market model, the benchmark for evaluating other market structures similar to those encountered by real-world firms including monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. The course will then move to build an understanding of the development and use of market power, and strategic interaction among firms. Last, the course will examine market failures including asymmetric information and externalities.\r\n\r\nOverall, this course was described as useful with \u201ca lot of substantial materials.\u201d This course covered materials on intermediate microeconomics and had some overlaps with ECON 10. Students learned to apply mathematical tools such as derivatives to solve relevant economics problems. Many students said the lectures and recitations were very useful and thought-provoking. However, students hoped that the more difficult math-related concepts were taught by the instructor instead of teaching assistants. \r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Kessler as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201caccessible.\u201d Many said that he was great at communicating the subject matter and \u201cengag[ing] student interest.\u201d Professor Kessler taught in a straightforward manner and at an acceptable pace. However, many students complaint that the lectures slides were simply \u201creflection of textbook\u201d and that Professor Kessler often tended to read off the slides.\r\n\r\nThere were complaints on the grade distribution of this course. Specifically, some students said that the exams were \u201cworth too much,\u201d and there seemed no need to assign 10% of the grade to class participation while problem sets were only worth 5%.All Wharton students are required to take this course or ECON 101. The prerequisites of this course are ECON 1 or equivalent, and MATH 103 or equivalent.\r\n", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/27071/sections/001/reviews/6055-JUDD-B--KESSLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6055-JUDD-B--KESSLER", "first_name": "JUDD B.", "last_name": "KESSLER", "id": "6055-JUDD-B--KESSLER", "name": "JUDD B.
