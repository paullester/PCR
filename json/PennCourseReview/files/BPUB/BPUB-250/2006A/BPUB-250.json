{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/235"}, "description": "This course introduces students to \"managerial economics,\" the application of microeconomic theory to management problems. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. Our goal in this course is to get you to internalize this body of theory well enough so that you can analyze management problems. While this is a \"tools course\", we will be mindful of applied business problems throughout the course. After presenting the competitive model we will dwell on other market structures more like those encountered by typical firms (monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition). We will spend some time on microeconomic lessons on the development and use of market power, as well as strategic interaction among firms. Finally, we will spend some time on the theory of market failure. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7425/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "3.46", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "BPUB-250-002", "path": "/courses/7425/sections/002", "id": "7425-002", "aliases": ["BPUB-250-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/7425/sections/002/reviews/2888-KATJA-SEIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2888-KATJA-SEIM", "first_name": "KATJA", "last_name": "SEIM", "id": "2888-KATJA-SEIM", "name": "KATJA SEIM"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "7425-002-2888-KATJA-SEIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BPUB-250", "path": "/courses/7425", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7425/sections", "values": [{"name": "MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "BPUB-250-002", "path": "/courses/7425/sections/002", "id": "7425-002", "aliases": ["BPUB-250-002"]}]}, "id": 7425, "aliases": ["BPUB-250"]}
