{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4528"}, "description": "Privatization is sweeping the globe. The redefinition of boundaries between the public and private sectors creates new and exciting opportunities for businesses and policy makers. This course will review the international experience with privatization -- the Thatcher privatizations of the 1980s, the current sale of electric utilities, airlines, and telecommunication companies in emerging and developed economies. We will also analyze the ongoing transformation of post Communist countries. Students will learn how to value state-owned assets using real option value techniques. We will discuss bidding strategies in privatization auctions. The last part of the course offers an introduction to project finance as a new form of cooperation between the public and private sectors. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "PRIVATIZATION: INT PERSP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17055/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.48", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "2.95", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "PRIVATIZATION: INT PERSP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-798-401", "path": "/courses/17055/sections/401", "id": "17055-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-798-401", "BPUB-298-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/17055/sections/401/reviews/4759-ARMEANE-M--CHOKSI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4759-ARMEANE-M--CHOKSI", "first_name": "ARMEANE M.", "last_name": "CHOKSI", "id": "4759-ARMEANE-M--CHOKSI", "name": "ARMEANE M.
