The course also examines the growing importance of allowing competitive markets to provide publicly funded services, taking advantage of private management approaches to fostering innovation in public management: vouchers (for medical care, education and housing), and contracting with private firms for provision of \"public\" services. Although not current events course many of these issues will incorporate discussion of the issues in the context of a new presidential administration, in an unusual economic environment. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "POLTCL ECON OF PUB SECTR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27072/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "POLTCL ECON OF PUB SECTR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-770-401", "path": "/courses/27072/sections/401", "id": "27072-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-770-401", "BPUB-201-401"]}, "comments": "The Political Economy of the Public Sector course explores the economics and politics of public policy to provide an analytic framework for considering why, how and with what success/failure government intervenes in a variety of policy areas. Particular attention will be paid to important policy issues relating to taxation, social security, low-income assistance, health insurance, education (both K-12 and higher ed), the environment, and government deficits. The costs and benefits of alternative policies will be explored along with the distribution of responsibilities between the federal, state, and local governments. While the course will focus primarily on U.S. policies, the topics covered (e.g. tax reform, deficits versus austerity, etc.) are currently at the center of the policy debate in many other industrialized countries as well.\r\nMost students found that this course was \u201cuseful\u201d an \u201cinteresting topic\u201d and an \u201cexcellent overview of economic public policy in the US.\u201d Many students found that they \u201clearned a great deal bout public finance in the US and the federal government regulations and programs, and also on a more general approach of public policy.\u201d However, some students found this class to me \u201cmore theoretical than practical.\u201d\r\nAll students thought that Professor Rosenbaum was great because he \u201ccares very much about making sure his students understand the course material.\u201d Students found that he is \u201centhusiastic\u201d \u201cvery accessible\u201d and \u201cvery good at explaining.\u201d However, one student found that his \u201centhusiasm leads him to be a little long-winded at times.\u201d\r\nThe majority of students did not like that there were \u201cdaily homework assignments and \u201cfrequent exams\u201d which was \u201cunneeded\u201d and \u201cfrustrating.\u201d Students also found that the reading was \u201coutdated.\u201d  This is an MBA course.
