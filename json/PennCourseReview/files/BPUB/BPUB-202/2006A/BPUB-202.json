{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/233"}, "description": "This course is an introductory course designed to familiarize the student with the subject matter of transportation. Expenditure in the transportation industry totals 16% of the US Gross Domestic Product and transportation and other supply chain expenditures in many firms are second only to labor costs. While the industry has been substantially deregulated in the last 25 years, the transition to deregulation is not complete and the legacy of 100 years of regulation still exists. In addition, the industry is unique in the sense that a major portion of the major factor of production (its infrastructure) is publicly financed. These factors make the industry different from others and suggest different management policies. Topics covered include: location analysis, mass transport, costs and pricing analysis, regulation and deregulation, and economic development. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "PRINC OF TRANPORTATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7423/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "2.97", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.81", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "PRINC OF TRANPORTATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BPUB-202-401", "path": "/courses/7423/sections/401", "id": "7423-401", "aliases": ["BPUB-202-401", "TRAN-201-401", "BPUB-664-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/7423/sections/401/reviews/210-W--BRUCE-ALLEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/210-W--BRUCE-ALLEN", "first_name": "W.
