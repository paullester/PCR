{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/198"}, "description": "This course is designed to introduce the student to the biological basis of cardiovascular and body fluid regulation. In the initial part of the course, the general principles of body fluid distribution and regulation of the circulation will be discussed. In the second part, the evolutionary origins of the physiological and behavioral controls of body fluids will be examined with particular emphasis on the transition from aquatic to land-dwelling animals. The third section of the course will investigate neural and hormonal controls of thirst and mineral appetites and their emergence from mammalian suckling. The final part will focus on disease of body fluids regulation such as hypertension, as well as critically examine therapeutic approaches to their treatment. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "BODY FLUID REGULATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1364/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58"}, "section": {"name": "BODY FLUID REGULATIONS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIBB-343-601", "path": "/courses/1364/sections/601", "id": "1364-601", "aliases": ["BIBB-343-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 50, "path": "/courses/1364/sections/601/reviews/169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY", "first_name": "STEVEN J", "last_name": "FLUHARTY", "id": "169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY", "name": "STEVEN J FLUHARTY"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "1364-601-169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-343", "path": "/courses/1364", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1364/sections", "values": [{"name": "BODY FLUID REGULATIONS", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIBB-343-601", "path": "/courses/1364/sections/601", "id": "1364-601", "aliases": ["BIBB-343-601"]}]}, "id": 1364, "aliases": ["BIBB-343"]}
