{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1701"}, "description": "This lecture course is designed to introduce the student to the functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is critically involved in the maintenance of body homeostasis through regulation of behavior and physiology. The course will begin with a review of the basic anatomy and physiology of the ANS including the sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric divisions. The mechanisms by which the ANS regulates peripheral tissues will be discussed, including reflex and regulatory functions, as will the effect of drugs which modulate ANS activity. The role of the ANS in regulating behavior will be addressed in the context of thirst, salt appetite and food intake. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "CHEMISTRY OF THE BRAIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2679/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.51", "rWorkRequired": "1.69", "rInstructorAccess": "2.76", "rReadingsValue": "1.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "3.73", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "CHEMISTRY OF THE BRAIN", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIBB-269-601", "path": "/courses/2679/sections/601", "id": "2679-601", "aliases": ["BIBB-269-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 86, "path": "/courses/2679/sections/601/reviews/169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY", "first_name": "STEVEN J", "last_name": "FLUHARTY", "id": "169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY", "name": "STEVEN J FLUHARTY"}, "num_reviewers": 68, "id": "2679-601-169-STEVEN-J-FLUHARTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-269", "path": "/courses/2679", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2679/sections", "values": [{"name": "CHEMISTRY OF THE BRAIN", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIBB-269-601", "path": "/courses/2679/sections/601", "id": "2679-601", "aliases": ["BIBB-269-601"]}]}, "id": 2679, "aliases": ["BIBB-269"]}
