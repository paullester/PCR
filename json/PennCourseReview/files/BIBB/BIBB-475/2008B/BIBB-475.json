{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3792"}, "description": "This course will familiarize students with advances in our understanding of the clinical features and pathogenesis of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, prion diseases, Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms, neurodegenerative ataxias, motoneuron diseases, degenerative diseases with chorea, iron and copper disorders, and mitochondrial diseases. Students will analyze original research reports on a range of proposed pathological cellular processes that may represent steps in cell dealth pathways leading to neuron loss seen in these diseases.Significant emphasis will be placed on the fast-expanding field exploring genetic contributions to neurodegenerative disease, as indentification of genetic mutations pathogenenic for familial neurodegenerative diseases has been a major driving force in eurodegenerative research and pointed researchers towards essential molecular process that may underlie these disorders. Strategies for therapeutic intervention in the management, prevention, and cure of neurodegenerativedisease will be addressed. \n\n", "semester": "2008B", "name": "NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEAS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19465/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.78", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEAS", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "BIBB-475-900", "path": "/courses/19465/sections/900", "id": "19465-900", "aliases": ["BIBB-475-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/19465/sections/900/reviews/171-NEDRA-LEXOW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/171-NEDRA-LEXOW", "first_name": "NEDRA", "last_name": "LEXOW", "id": "171-NEDRA-LEXOW", "name": "NEDRA LEXOW"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "19465-900-171-NEDRA-LEXOW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-475", "path": "/courses/19465", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19465/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEAS", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "BIBB-475-900", "path": "/courses/19465/sections/900", "id": "19465-900", "aliases": ["BIBB-475-900"]}]}, "id": 19465, "aliases": ["BIBB-475"]}
