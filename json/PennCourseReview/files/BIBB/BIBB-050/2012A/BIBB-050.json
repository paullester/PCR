{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5379"}, "description": "Progress in behavioral neuroscience and brain imaging techniques, such as functional and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has forced the courts to reconsider the role of behavioral sciences in courtroom decision-making. The goal of this course is to enable students understand and interpret the use of behavioral neuroscience evidence in the justice system. The course will introduce the students to the relevant behavioral neuroscience constructs, principles of brain imaging and rules of scientific evidence. Students will be asked to use this introductory knowledge to critically evaluate the use of brain imaging and other behavioral neuroscience techniques as evidence in representative legal cases. For each case, students will serve as neuroscience experts for the defense or prosecution and prepare, present and defend their testimony against the opposing team. Through this course, students will develop the ability to critically evaluate brain imaging and other neuroscience data in forensic and legal settings. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "FORENSIC NEUROSCIENCE: Forensic Neuroscience & Brain Imaging", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27029/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "1.93", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "FORENSIC NEUROSCIENCE: Forensic Neuroscience & Brain Imaging", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-050-301", "path": "/courses/27029/sections/301", "id": "27029-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-050-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/27029/sections/301/reviews/6047-DANIEL-D--LANGLEBEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6047-DANIEL-D--LANGLEBEN", "first_name": "DANIEL D.", "last_name": "LANGLEBEN", "id": "6047-DANIEL-D--LANGLEBEN", "name": "DANIEL D.
