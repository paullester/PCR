It also addresses the pathological syndromes that result from damage to these systems.\r\n\r\nStudents frequently used the same two words to describe this cognitive neuroscience course: \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cdifficult.\u201d Most students applauded the subject matter and structure of the course. The course was designed with \u201ca focus on the importance of material to our world and not its relevance to the exam.\u201d The difficulty of the material presented a considerable\u2014but, \u201cif you put in enough effort,\u201d a surmountable\u2014challenge to students as well. The fact that there were no small, periodic assignments on material presented in class to help reinforce concepts was distressing to some students.\r\n\r\nProfessor Epstein\u2019s sense humor and passion for the material made the material much more digestible. His use of \u201chelpful\u201d video clips to demonstrate particular cognitive disorders was also much appreciated by his students. However, they critiqued the pacing of the lectures and the class, saying that some sections of the course were \u201crushed\u201d and that a little too much time was spent on perception, the professor\u2019s area of expertise. Students also complained that the course often had more breadth than depth, citing the fact that too many experiments were presented in lecture without adequate explanation. In general, however, most students characterized the class as a \u201cpositive intellectual experience\u201d and characterized Professor Epstein as a \u201cgreat professor.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the Living World Sector. It is cross-listed under psychology and biology. Some psychology students in the course reported a concern about their ability to do well in the class: one student wrote \u201cone of my favorite psych lecture courses in all 4 years here, but definitely challenging.\u201d Some biology-focused students were not satisfied with the organization or approach of the class.", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/20751/sections/401/reviews/2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN", "first_name": "RUSSELL ALAN", "last_name": "EPSTEIN", "id": "2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN", "name": "RUSSELL ALAN EPSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 50, "id": "20751-401-2317-RUSSELL-ALAN-EPSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-149", "path": "/courses/20751", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20751/sections", "values": [{"name": "COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-149-401", "path": "/courses/20751/sections/401", "id": "20751-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-149-401", "BIBB-249-401"]}]}, "id": 20751, "aliases": ["PSYC-149", "BIBB-249"]}
