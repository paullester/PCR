{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/199"}, "description": "The course will begin with a review of basic concepts in pharmacology including: routes of drug administration, drug metabolism, the dose response curve, tolerance and sensitization. Following a brief overview of cellular foundations of neuropharmacology (cell biology, synaptic and receptor function), the course will focus on various classes of drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders including, among others, depression, schizophrenia and anxiety. We will additionally consider mechanisms mediating the mind-altering, addictive and neurotoxic effects of abused drugs. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "DRUGS, BRAIN AND MIND", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14150/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.47", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "1.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.95", "rCourseQuality": "2.27", "rWorkRequired": "1.73", "rInstructorAccess": "2.52", "rReadingsValue": "2.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "2.11", "rInstructorQuality": "2.08"}, "section": {"name": "DRUGS, BRAIN AND MIND", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-370-401", "path": "/courses/14150/sections/401", "id": "14150-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-370-401", "PSYC-125-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 140, "path": "/courses/14150/sections/401/reviews/170-LAURA-L-PEOPLES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/170-LAURA-L-PEOPLES", "first_name": "LAURA L", "last_name": "PEOPLES", "id": "170-LAURA-L-PEOPLES", "name": "LAURA L PEOPLES"}, "num_reviewers": 99, "id": "14150-401-170-LAURA-L-PEOPLES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-370", "path": "/courses/14150", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14150/sections", "values": [{"name": "DRUGS, BRAIN AND MIND", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-370-401", "path": "/courses/14150/sections/401", "id": "14150-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-370-401", "PSYC-125-401"]}]}, "id": 14150, "aliases": ["BIBB-370", "PSYC-125"]}
