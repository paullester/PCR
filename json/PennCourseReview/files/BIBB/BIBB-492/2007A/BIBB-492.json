{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2993"}, "description": "In this lab course, a small number of students (12-20) meet once per week to discuss topics in synaptic physiology and to become proficient at sharp electrode techniques for intracellular recording, using isolated ganglia from the snail Heliosoma. The first part of each class will consist of discussion of weekly reading from the primary literature, with the remainder of the class devoted to hands-on experiments. After learning to record from and characterize single neurons, students will study synaptic transmission by stimulating incoming nerve trunks or by recording from pairs of interconnected neurons. As a midterm assignment, students will prepare and present a short research proposal using this model system, to be evaluated by the class. For the last half of the course, the class will work together on one or two of these proposals, meeting at the end of each class to pool our data, analyze the results and discuss their significance. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "METHODS IN SYNAPTIC PHYS: Experimental Methods in Synaptic Physiology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14158/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "1.30", "rStimulateInterest": "3.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "0.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70"}, "section": {"name": "METHODS IN SYNAPTIC PHYS: Experimental Methods in Synaptic Physiology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-492-301", "path": "/courses/14158/sections/301", "id": "14158-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-492-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/14158/sections/301/reviews/2877-MICHAEL-KAPLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2877-MICHAEL-KAPLAN", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "KAPLAN", "id": "2877-MICHAEL-KAPLAN", "name": "MICHAEL KAPLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "14158-301-2877-MICHAEL-KAPLAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-492", "path": "/courses/14158", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14158/sections", "values": [{"name": "METHODS IN SYNAPTIC PHYS: Experimental Methods in Synaptic Physiology", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-492-301", "path": "/courses/14158/sections/301", "id": "14158-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-492-301"]}]}, "id": 14158, "aliases": ["BIBB-492"]}
