{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/947"}, "description": "This course focuses on evaluating the experiments that have sought to establish links between brain structure (the activity of specific brain circuits) and behavioral function (the control of particular motivated and emotional behaviors). Students are exposed to concepts from regulatory physiology, systems neuroscience, pharmacology, and endocrinology and read textbook as well as original source materials. The course focuses on the following behaviors: feeding, sex, fear, anxiety, the appetite for salt, and food aversion. The course also considers the neurochemical control of responses with an eye towards evaluating the development of drug treatments for: obesity, anorexia/cachexia, vomiting, sexual dysfunction, anxiety disorders, and depression. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PHYSIOLOGY MOTIVATED BEH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7044/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.98", "rStimulateInterest": "1.79", "rRecommendMajor": "2.93", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "2.74", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.17", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSIOLOGY MOTIVATED BEH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-127-401", "path": "/courses/7044/sections/401", "id": "7044-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-127-401", "BIBB-227-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/7044/sections/401/reviews/1021-HARVEY-J-GRILL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1021-HARVEY-J-GRILL", "first_name": "HARVEY J", "last_name": "GRILL", "id": "1021-HARVEY-J-GRILL", "name": "HARVEY J GRILL"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "7044-401-1021-HARVEY-J-GRILL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-127", "path": "/courses/7044", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7044/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSIOLOGY MOTIVATED BEH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-127-401", "path": "/courses/7044/sections/401", "id": "7044-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-127-401", "BIBB-227-401"]}]}, "id": 7044, "aliases": ["PSYC-127", "BIBB-227"]}
