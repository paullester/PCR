BIBB-109 is a prerequisite.\r\n\r\nStudents described BIBB-270 as \u201cone of the most interesting courses at Penn\u201d and \u201cinformative.\u201d Students also felt that the course was \u201cmanageable\u201d for students without a strong background in biology. In general, they liked the inclusion of group exercises; however, many felt that the three-hour lecture format made it \u201chard to concentrate.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents had mixed reviews of Professor Zach.
