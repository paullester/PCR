Following a brief overview of cellular foundations of neuropharmacology (cell biology, synaptic and receptor function), the course will focus on various classes of drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders including, among others, depression, schizophrenia,and anxiety. Mechanisms mediating the mind-altering, addictive and neurotoxic effects of abused drugs will also be covered.\r\n\r\n\tStudents really enjoyed this \u201cawesome\u201d course, describing the material as very interesting. Students appreciated the balance of drug use and drug action topics discussed in the class. Some mentioned that the class was disorganized, however, and another wrote that the content seemed to be repeated a lot and was redundant.\r\n\r\nOne student wrote that the professor \u201chas great ability in stimulating interest in her students.\u201d Another mentioned that sometimes the \u201clanguage barrier\u201d was an issue, but overall students seemed to enjoy having Dr. Zach as their professor.\r\n\r\n\tExams were described as easy, though there were multiple typos, and multiple answers to multiple choice questions. A student commented that many answers on exams differed from lectures/notes and class readings.", "num_students": 105, "path": "/courses/27032/sections/401/reviews/5292-NETA-ZACH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5292-NETA-ZACH", "first_name": "NETA", "last_name": "ZACH", "id": "5292-NETA-ZACH", "name": "NETA ZACH"}, "num_reviewers": 101, "id": "27032-401-5292-NETA-ZACH"}]
