{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4397"}, "description": "This course will review recent research that combines psychological, economic and neuroscientific approaches to study human and animal decision-making. A particular focus will be on how evidence about the neural processes associated with choices might be used to constrain economic and psychological theories of decision-making. Topics covered will include decisions involving risk and uncertainty, reinforcement learning, strategic interactions and games, and social preferences. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "NEUROECONOMICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28087/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.17", "rRecommendMajor": "2.58", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.17", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "NEUROECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-473-401", "path": "/courses/28087/sections/401", "id": "28087-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-473-401", "BIBB-473-401", "NGG-706-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/28087/sections/401/reviews/4548-JOSEPH-W--KABLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4548-JOSEPH-W--KABLE", "first_name": "JOSEPH W.", "last_name": "KABLE", "id": "4548-JOSEPH-W--KABLE", "name": "JOSEPH W.
