{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/224"}, "description": "This course considers the sorts of knowledge that animals have of their environment, their location in space, and their conspecifics. How do different animal species remember where food is located or find their way home? What is the adaptive significance of recognizing other individuals' social relationships or dominance ranks? The behavior of animals from a variety of different taxa is considered, ranging from invertebrates to apes. Emphasis is placed on animals living under natural conditions, though some research on learning and memory in captive animals is also discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "ANIMAL COGNITION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28630/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "ANIMAL COGNITION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-432-401", "path": "/courses/28630/sections/401", "id": "28630-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-432-401", "BIBB-432-401", "PSYC-431-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/28630/sections/401/reviews/204-DOROTHY-L-CHENEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/204-DOROTHY-L-CHENEY", "first_name": "DOROTHY L", "last_name": "CHENEY", "id": "204-DOROTHY-L-CHENEY", "name": "DOROTHY L CHENEY"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "28630-401-204-DOROTHY-L-CHENEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-432", "path": "/courses/28630", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28630/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANIMAL COGNITION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-432-401", "path": "/courses/28630/sections/401", "id": "28630-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-432-401", "BIBB-432-401", "PSYC-431-401"]}]}, "id": 28630, "aliases": ["BIOL-432", "BIBB-432", "PSYC-431"]}
