This course stresses independent thinking, professional responsibility, and personal accountability.\r\n\r\nThe students in this course were given extremely valuable exposure to medicine, and even though the Emergency Department has a tendency to be hectic, students felt prepared to handle the responsibilities entrusted to them. The work assigned was also very reasonable and applicable. Students believe that this class will help to make stronger future medical students. Students also learned a lot about how research is conducted in a hospital. Students felt that Professor Hollander was always available if they required assistance.\r\n\r\nThe permission of the instructor is required to enroll in this course. Students warn that this course requires a huge time commitment. The time requirement is a lot so they wouldn't recommend it for undergratuates/post-bacs with a full course load. Also, the same experience is offered to volunteers, so paying tuition for it might be something to reconsider. The true value of this course comes from the fact that someone actually lets pre-health professionals get significant exposure into clinical medicine, which is a rarity.\r\n", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/21335/sections/601/reviews/173-JUDD-E--HOLLANDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/173-JUDD-E--HOLLANDER", "first_name": "JUDD E.", "last_name": "HOLLANDER", "id": "173-JUDD-E--HOLLANDER", "name": "JUDD E.
