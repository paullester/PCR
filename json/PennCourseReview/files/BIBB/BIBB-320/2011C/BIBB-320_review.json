It highlights basic research design,\r\nresearch ethics, data collection, and good clinical practices. Students work closely with\r\nfaculty in the Emergency Department at CHOP and HUP, engaging in screening,\r\nrecruiting, and consenting patients for a variety of studies. The course also includes a\r\nsupplemental seminar series that introduces students to innovative, focused areas of\r\nmedical research. This course stresses independent thinking, professional responsibility,\r\nand personal accountability.\r\nNearly all students reported learning a lot from their experience working in the\r\nEmergency Department and found the clinical aspect of the course to be both \u201cenjoyable\u201d\r\nand \u201cvaluable.\u201d One student described it as an \u201cinteresting introduction to clinical\r\nresearch,\u201d and another reported that it was \u201crealistic\u201d to what students will encounter in\r\ntheir futures in medicine.\r\nOverall, students reported feeling frustrated with Dr. Hollander for being\r\n\u201cambiguous about grading,\u201d especially for the clinical portion, and \u201cunwilling to discuss\r\nthe class, exams, and grades.\u201d Dr. Hollander posted answers to exams but would not\r\naddress students\u2019 individual concerns. One student noted that Dr. Hollander\u2019s failure to\r\ndiscuss topics related to exams \u201cstymies full understanding and can leave students\r\nconfused.\u201d\r\nGrades for this course were determined by: two midterm exams, a final exam, and\r\na clinical portion. Students generally agreed that the midterms were \u201cdifficult.\u201d While a\r\ncouple of students thought the exams tested \u201crelevant knowledge\u201d and were\r\n\u201cstraightforward,\u201d others expressed frustration with their \u201ctricky wording.\u201d The second\r\nmidterm tested students on \u201coperational material\u201d and knowledge of hospital procedures,\r\nwhich a couple of students found difficult to prepare for and noted that students\u2019 grades\r\nwere lower for this exam compared to the others. The final seemed more \u201cfair,\u201d\r\nhowever. Overall, students found the course to be valuable, though demanding, and one\r\nstudent recommended that it be taken by \u201cevery student who is pre-health bound.\u201d The\r\npermission of the instructor is required for enrollment in this course.", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/24049/sections/601/reviews/173-JUDD-E--HOLLANDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/173-JUDD-E--HOLLANDER", "first_name": "JUDD E.", "last_name": "HOLLANDER", "id": "173-JUDD-E--HOLLANDER", "name": "JUDD E.
