{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/948"}, "description": "This course will provide an introduction to the experimental analysis of natural animal behavior, and its neurobiological basis. Behavior is examined in an evolutionary and ecological context, questions are focused on the neural processes that allow animals to carry out critical tasks such as locating prey and finding mates. The course is comparative and an effort is made to identify common principles in sensory processing and brain function. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "BRAIN, BEHAV & EVOLUTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/948/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.68", "rStimulateInterest": "2.02", "rRecommendMajor": "2.73", "rCourseQuality": "2.34", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorAccess": "2.98", "rReadingsValue": "2.66", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.23", "rCommAbility": "2.59", "rInstructorQuality": "2.82"}, "section": {"name": "BRAIN, BEHAV & EVOLUTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-133-401", "path": "/courses/948/sections/401", "id": "948-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-133-401", "BIBB-233-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 69, "path": "/courses/948/sections/401/reviews/1022-JOHN-D--CRAWFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1022-JOHN-D--CRAWFORD", "first_name": "JOHN D.", "last_name": "CRAWFORD", "id": "1022-JOHN-D--CRAWFORD", "name": "JOHN D.
