The course will study the diversity of behavior across animals of many taxa and give special focus to social interactions, mating, and communication. The main texts are Animal Behavior: An evolutionary Approach by Alcock and Exploring Animal Behavior by Sherman and Alcock. There are three midterms and no finals. \r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed the readings in this course and the additional readings were \u201cfor the most part beneficial.\u201d Most of the students enjoyed the content covered in the class but said that it was too \u201cone-sided,\u201d mostly focusing on birds and primates. \r\n\r\nA large number of students praised Professor White for his ability to make the topic interesting. He is \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201chilarious,\u201d often incorporating videos to demonstrate concepts. Some students described Professor White as their favorite teacher at Penn and the course as their best course of the semester. On the other hand, students also thought Professor White could spend his lectures \u201cmore wisely and efficiently\u201d, as he spends too much times going over examples. \r\n\r\nAlmost all of the students think the midterms and quizzes were \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d and \u201cvery poorly written\u201d. Grading is inconsistent and often contains \u201cambiguous open questions\u201d that were not mentioned in class. Students coming into this course expected easier exams and were surprised by their difficulty.\r\n", "num_students": 140, "path": "/courses/23699/sections/401/reviews/2665-DAVID-J-WHITE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2665-DAVID-J-WHITE", "first_name": "DAVID J", "last_name": "WHITE", "id": "2665-DAVID-J-WHITE", "name": "DAVID J WHITE"}, "num_reviewers": 132, "id": "23699-401-2665-DAVID-J-WHITE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSYC-131", "path": "/courses/23699", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23699/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANIMAL BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSYC-131-401", "path": "/courses/23699/sections/401", "id": "23699-401", "aliases": ["PSYC-131-401", "BIBB-231-401", "BIOL-231-401"]}]}, "id": 23699, "aliases": ["PSYC-131", "BIBB-231", "BIOL-231"]}
