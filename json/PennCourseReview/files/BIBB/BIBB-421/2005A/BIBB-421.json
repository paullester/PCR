{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2991"}, "description": "The ability to utilize different imaging techniques in disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and cognitive neurosciences is a growing field and presents many interesting problems and possibilities. This course is an upper level seminar course for individuals pursuing one of the above mentioned fields and/or premedical course work. The course would provide a detailed overview of functional brain imaging and its potential uses. Issues regarding advantages and disadvantages of different modalities, study design image analysis and interpretation, and how each of these relates to various neurological and psychological phenomena will be discussed. The classes will cover the following specific topics in this general time frame: Introduction to functional brain function, basics of nuclear medicine imaging (including instrumentation, image acquisition, and radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography), imaging of neurological disorders, imaging of psychological disorders, introduction to activation studies, image analysis and statistical problems, study design, literature review, journal article presentation, tour of Penn imaging facilities, interpretation of imaging studies, implications for clinical and research, and implications for understand the human mind and consciousness. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "HUMAN BRAIN IMAGING: Functional Imaging of the Human Brain", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10117/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.22", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "HUMAN BRAIN IMAGING: Functional Imaging of the Human Brain", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-421-301", "path": "/courses/10117/sections/301", "id": "10117-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-421-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/10117/sections/301/reviews/2675-ANDREW-B--NEWBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2675-ANDREW-B--NEWBERG", "first_name": "ANDREW B.", "last_name": "NEWBERG", "id": "2675-ANDREW-B--NEWBERG", "name": "ANDREW B.
