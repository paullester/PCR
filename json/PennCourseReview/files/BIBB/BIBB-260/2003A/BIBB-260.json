{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1234"}, "description": "This course is designed to examine the various roles played by the nervous and endocrine systems in controlling both physiological processes and behavior. First, the course will build a foundation in the concepts of neural and endocrine system function. Then, we will discuss how these mechanisms form the biological underpinnings of various behaviors and their relevant physiological correlates. We will focus on sexual and parental behaviors, stress, metabolism, neuroendocrine-immune interactions, and mental health. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1362/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.55", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.21", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.85", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-260-401", "path": "/courses/1362/sections/401", "id": "1362-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-260-401", "PSYC-139-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/1362/sections/401/reviews/1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO", "first_name": "LORETTA MARIE", "last_name": "FLANAGAN-CATO", "id": "1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO", "name": "LORETTA MARIE FLANAGAN-CATO"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "1362-401-1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-260", "path": "/courses/1362", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1362/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-260-401", "path": "/courses/1362/sections/401", "id": "1362-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-260-401", "PSYC-139-401"]}]}, "id": 1362, "aliases": ["BIBB-260", "PSYC-139"]}
