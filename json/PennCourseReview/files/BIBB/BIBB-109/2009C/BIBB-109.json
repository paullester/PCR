The main text is Bear's Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain, which many students said was extremely helpful. This course fulfills the Living World Sector requirement for Arts and Sciences students.\r\n\r\nMost students rated the course as interesting, and one in which they \u201clearned a lot,\u201d especially in the second half of the course. Other students noted how the material was \u201crelevant and important.\u201d Students disagreed about whether or not the topics should have been dealt with in greater depth: although some felt there should have been more detail covered, others felt that there was already too much material.\r\n\r\nStudents generally had a positive impression of Professor Medina, citing his \u201cconnection with the students\u201d and his ability to make material \u201cengaging and comprehensible.\u201d One senior went so far as to describe him as \u201cone of the best lecturers I've had at Penn.\u201d If students had one main criticism of Prof. Medina, it was that he encouraged competition that was \u201cnot conducive to learning.\u201d&#8232;\r\n\r\nMost students were BIBB majors or minors, though with a range of prior knowledge. Some noted that some non-majors dropped after the first exam, making the curve harder for everyone else. Most students did not find the material itself difficult, but complained about the exams, which were more abstract than reflective of readings and lectures and were longer than there was time for, turning each into a \u201ctest of endurance.\u201d Workload, however, was fairly light, consisting mostly of reading. Students who wanted study aids found reviewing the slides and lecture recordings on Blackboard particularly useful, though they also stated that material was \u201cnot hard to follow\u201d if you attended lectures.", "num_students": 142, "path": "/courses/17013/sections/401/reviews/4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA", "first_name": "JAVIER F.", "last_name": "MEDINA", "id": "4262-JAVIER-F--MEDINA", "name": "JAVIER F.
