The class begins with a description of the cellular basis of neuronal activities and then moves to a discussion of the physiological bases of motor control, sensory systems, motivated behaviors, and higher mental processes. The course is primarily targeted to students interested in neurobiology of behavior, including animal behaviors and clinical disorders.\r\n\r\nMost students seemed to enjoy the class and felt that they had learned about the brain from a detailed \u201cchemical, biological, and anatomical point of view.\u201d Although students felt they picked up on the basic concepts, many expressed frustration over there being \u201ctons of information\u201d and too many \u201cminute details,\u201d which were difficult to remember throughout the course.\r\n\r\nProfessor Muzzio overall received fairly positive reviews. Besides a few complaints on her ability to cover the comprehensive amount of course material, most students described her as \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cpassionate\u201d and able to \u201ccommunicate material very clearly especially considering [its] complexity.\u201d Students appreciated that she \u201cemphasized understanding instead of memorization.\u201d Many were also impressed by her ability to make a complex and information-heavy subject stimulating. There was a wide range of comments concerning Professor Muzzio\u2019s accessibility: some felt that she was willing and always available during office hours, while others thought that she could be impatient.\r\n\r\nStudents enrolled in this class ranged from BIBB majors to psychology majors attempting to fulfill their neural requirement, as well as students fulfilling the Living World Sector. Students should expect three midterms. The large volume of information was the largest contribution to the difficult workload.\r\n", "num_students": 135, "path": "/courses/21332/sections/401/reviews/4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO", "first_name": "ISABEL", "last_name": "MUZZIO", "id": "4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO", "name": "ISABEL MUZZIO"}, "num_reviewers": 122, "id": "21332-401-4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.87", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "2.87", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO BRAIN & BEHAV", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIBB-109-601", "path": "/courses/21332/sections/601", "id": "21332-601", "aliases": ["BIBB-109-601", "BIOL-109-601", "PSYC-109-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/21332/sections/601/reviews/5292-NETA-ZACH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5292-NETA-ZACH", "first_name": "NETA", "last_name": "ZACH", "id": "5292-NETA-ZACH", "name": "NETA ZACH"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "21332-601-5292-NETA-ZACH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-109", "path": "/courses/21332", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21332/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO BRAIN & BEHAV", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-109-401", "path": "/courses/21332/sections/401", "id": "21332-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-109-401", "BIOL-109-401", "PSYC-109-401"]}, {"name": "INTRO TO BRAIN & BEHAV", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIBB-109-601", "path": "/courses/21332/sections/601", "id": "21332-601", "aliases": ["BIBB-109-601", "BIOL-109-601", "PSYC-109-601"]}]}, "id": 21332, "aliases": ["BIBB-109", "BIOL-109", "PSYC-109"]}
