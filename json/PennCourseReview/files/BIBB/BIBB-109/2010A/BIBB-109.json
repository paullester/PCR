Starting from the cellular level, students move up to study higher levels of the nervous system. The course is intended for those interested in the neurobiology of behavior in humans and other vertebrate animals. Familiarity with introductory physics and chemistry may be helpful. This class fulfills College Sector V: Living World.\r\n\r\nMost students enjoyed the class, which \u201creally interesting.\u201d For some students, this course was the \u201cmost inspiring course\u201d they had ever taken. One student called the course an \u201cexcellent overview of current topics in neuroscience.\u201d However, a few students said that there was a lot of information to memorize, and that the lectures were often hard to follow.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Muzzio as \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and \u201cpassionate.\u201d Many students appreciated that she was very accessible and took the time to meet with students and answer their questions. Professor Muzzio \u201cwas able to stimulate interest\u201d in a wide range of topics. A few students noted that, whether because of the lecture hall\u2019s acoustics, Professor Muzzio could be hard to understand at times.\r\n\r\nPremedical students usually take this course with some College students who are fulfilling the Living World sector requirement. One student noted that the class was competitive, and a few students commented that the exam did not reflect the material learned.\r\n", "num_students": 154, "path": "/courses/25675/sections/401/reviews/4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO", "first_name": "ISABEL", "last_name": "MUZZIO", "id": "4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO", "name": "ISABEL MUZZIO"}, "num_reviewers": 137, "id": "25675-401-4254-ISABEL-MUZZIO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-109", "path": "/courses/25675", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25675/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO BRAIN & BEHAV", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-109-401", "path": "/courses/25675/sections/401", "id": "25675-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-109-401", "PSYC-109-401", "BIOL-109-401"]}]}, "id": 25675, "aliases": ["BIBB-109", "PSYC-109", "BIOL-109"]}
