{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4524"}, "description": "In this course, we will explore the development and manifestations of sleep from the simple daily rest triggered by the biological clock in the fly to the complex brain wave changes in higher mammals, especially humans. We will study our own requirements for sleep, and how it changes through the lifespan as we grow, mature, and age. We will study the impact of sleeplessness on daytime performance. We will discuss psychological and medical issues that may impact human sleep, and strategies that we may employ to insure that we get enough good quality sleep to insure that we are performing at our best during wakefulness. The course will likely include demonstrations of hypnosis, and visits to laboratories on campus that study sleep and its effects on performance. Students will be expected to prepare oral and/or written reports that will be used in their evaluation. The target audience will be students interested in biology, neuroscience, psychology, or anyone who would like to improve the quality and quantity of their own sleep. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "Sleep: What is it, why do we need it, and how can we get more?", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22701/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.76", "rDifficulty": "1.53", "rStimulateInterest": "1.59", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.28", "rWorkRequired": "1.12", "rInstructorAccess": "3.35", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "Sleep: What is it, why do we need it, and how can we get more?", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-040-301", "path": "/courses/22701/sections/301", "id": "22701-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-040-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/22701/sections/301/reviews/4754-LEE-J--BROOKS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4754-LEE-J--BROOKS", "first_name": "LEE J.", "last_name": "BROOKS", "id": "4754-LEE-J--BROOKS", "name": "LEE J.
