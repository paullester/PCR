It conentrates on the design and performance of clinical research, with emphasis on responsibility toward research subjects, data collection, analysis and medical writing. There are weekly, 90 minute lectures, supplemented by participation in an ongoing research project. Small teams of students will gather data, working closely with the clinical research staff in the Department of Neurosurgery. There are also periodic reviews of progress with faculty. At the end of the semester, each team will present its progress. Contribution to successful projects will also results in credit on ensuing publications. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "CLINICAL RES.
