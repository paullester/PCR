We will focus on sexual and parental behaviors, stress, metabolism, neuroendocrine-immune interactions, and mental health. The format will be a mixture of lectures and journal club discussions based on recent primary literature in the field of neuroendocrinology. Students will also write several short papers based on the clinical neuroendocrinology. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19831/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "2.81", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.19", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-460-401", "path": "/courses/19831/sections/401", "id": "19831-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-460-401", "PSYC-439-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/19831/sections/401/reviews/1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO", "first_name": "LORETTA MARIE", "last_name": "FLANAGAN-CATO", "id": "1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO", "name": "LORETTA MARIE FLANAGAN-CATO"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "19831-401-1281-LORETTA-MARIE-FLANAGAN-CATO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-460", "path": "/courses/19831", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19831/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIBB-460-401", "path": "/courses/19831/sections/401", "id": "19831-401", "aliases": ["BIBB-460-401", "PSYC-439-401"]}]}, "id": 19831, "aliases": ["BIBB-460", "PSYC-439"]}
