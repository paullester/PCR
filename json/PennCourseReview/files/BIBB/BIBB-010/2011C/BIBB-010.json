{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5184"}, "description": "This course will use famous case studies of patients with a variety of different types of brain damage to begin to understand brain function. Topics to be discussed include the relationship between brain activity and consciousness, the different faculties of the mind and their localization with the brain. Students will explore the diverse explanations that researchers have proposed over decades to the question of how brain activity could generate the complexities of human consciousness. Students will learn why some men think their wives are hats and how a blind man can dodge a bullet, how a psychopathic personality can develop, what are our most primitive fears and how to build a zombie using household appliances. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Understanding brain function thru famous case studies", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24045/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "Understanding brain function thru famous case studies", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-010-301", "path": "/courses/24045/sections/301", "id": "24045-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-010-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/24045/sections/301/reviews/5292-NETA-ZACH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5292-NETA-ZACH", "first_name": "NETA", "last_name": "ZACH", "id": "5292-NETA-ZACH", "name": "NETA ZACH"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "24045-301-5292-NETA-ZACH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIBB-010", "path": "/courses/24045", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24045/sections", "values": [{"name": "Understanding brain function thru famous case studies", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIBB-010-301", "path": "/courses/24045/sections/301", "id": "24045-301", "aliases": ["BIBB-010-301"]}]}, "id": 24045, "aliases": ["BIBB-010"]}
