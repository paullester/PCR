{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2240"}, "description": "The availability of new methods for studying the brain in humans and other species has resulted in a virtual explosion of studies on sex differences in neurobiology, and not all that has hit the media is based on solid grounds. However, some consistent findings indicate that sex differences in brain structure and functional activity exist in humans and other species and that they relate importantly to behavioral differences in health and disease. For example, men, who are more prone to physical aggression and sexual promiscuity, have less brain tissue in frontal brain regions implicated in the modulation of emotion. This is reversed in schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts earlier and is more severe in men. These sex differences also have implications for understanding how sexual differentiation plays a role in evolution and perhaps even permit some speculation on their societal and cultural implications. The seminar will combine lecture with discussion of empirical research results with individual and team research projects focusing on aspects of sex differences. The framework will be oriented toward neurobehavioral research, so readiness to understand biological and cognitive concepts and methodology will be needed. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "SEX DIFFS:BEHAVIOR BIOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5043/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.36", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "2.79", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "1.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.07", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.93", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "SEX DIFFS:BEHAVIOR BIOL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-007-401", "path": "/courses/5043/sections/401", "id": "5043-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-007-401", "BIBB-007-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/5043/sections/401/reviews/2412-RUBEN-GUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2412-RUBEN-GUR", "first_name": "RUBEN", "last_name": "GUR", "id": "2412-RUBEN-GUR", "name": "RUBEN GUR"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "5043-401-2412-RUBEN-GUR"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.13", "rDifficulty": "1.56", "rStimulateInterest": "2.81", "rRecommendMajor": "2.06", "rCourseQuality": "1.94", "rWorkRequired": "1.81", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.81", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "SEX DIFFS:BEHAVIOR BIOL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-007-401", "path": "/courses/5043/sections/401", "id": "5043-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-007-401", "BIBB-007-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/5043/sections/401/reviews/2413-RAQUEL-E-GUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2413-RAQUEL-E-GUR", "first_name": "RAQUEL E", "last_name": "GUR", "id": "2413-RAQUEL-E-GUR", "name": "RAQUEL E GUR"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "5043-401-2413-RAQUEL-E-GUR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-007", "path": "/courses/5043", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5043/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEX DIFFS:BEHAVIOR BIOL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-007-401", "path": "/courses/5043/sections/401", "id": "5043-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-007-401", "BIBB-007-401"]}]}, "id": 5043, "aliases": ["BIOL-007", "BIBB-007"]}
