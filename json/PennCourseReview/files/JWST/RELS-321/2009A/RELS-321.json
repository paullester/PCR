{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4404"}, "description": "While accepting \"the yoke of the commandments,\" Jewish thinkers from antiquity onward have sought to make the teachings of the revelation more meaningful in our own lives. Additional impetus has come from overtly polemical challenges to the Law, such as those leveled by Paul, Christian biblical exegetes, Spinoza and Kant. This course explores both the critiques of Jewish Law, and Jewish relections on the meaning and purpose of the commandments, by examining a range of primary sources within their intellectual, historical, and cultural contexts. Texts - in English translation - include selections from idrash, Gospels, Talmud, philosophy, biblical exegesis, kabbalah, hasidic homilies, Enlightment challenges and responses, and contemporary attempts to revalue and invent Jewish rituals. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "SPIRIT AND LAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16412/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "SPIRIT AND LAW", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-321-401", "path": "/courses/16412/sections/401", "id": "16412-401", "aliases": ["RELS-321-401", "JWST-520-401", "RELS-520-401", "JWST-320-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/16412/sections/401/reviews/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "first_name": "TALYA", "last_name": "FISHMAN", "id": "1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "name": "TALYA FISHMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "16412-401-1057-TALYA-FISHMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-321", "path": "/courses/16412", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16412/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPIRIT AND LAW", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-321-401", "path": "/courses/16412/sections/401", "id": "16412-401", "aliases": ["RELS-321-401", "JWST-520-401", "RELS-520-401", "JWST-320-401"]}]}, "id": 16412, "aliases": ["RELS-321", "JWST-520", "RELS-520", "JWST-320"]}
