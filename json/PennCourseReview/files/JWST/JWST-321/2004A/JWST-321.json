{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2864"}, "description": "This course will investigate the cultural history of the Jews of Spain (the Sephardim), from the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 until the expulsion of 1492. Medieval Spain, with its vibrant Muslim and Jewish populations, was one of the most complex and culturally rich European societies of its time. It served as a bridge for intellectual, artistic and scientific imports from the east to the European north. Its experiment with convivencia -- \"the living together\" of three different religions within the same society -- was unheard of in pre-modern Europe. With convivencia as our lens, we will examine the possibilities and limitations of multi-cultural trajectory of the Sephardim and their Christian and Muslim neighbors. This course will explore the rich intellectual and artistic heritage of the Sephardim. We will read (in translation) a wide range of Sephardic writing: the poets of the Andalusian Golden age, the neo-Aristotelian philosphers and scientists, Kabalistic visionaries, travel diaries, converso dramatists and the music of the Aljamas as preserved in Ladino ballads. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "THE SEPHARDIC EXPERIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6742/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "JWST-321", "path": "/courses/6742", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6742/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE SEPHARDIC EXPERIENCE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "JWST-321-601", "path": "/courses/6742/sections/601", "id": "6742-601", "aliases": ["JWST-321-601"]}]}, "id": 6742, "aliases": ["JWST-321"]}
