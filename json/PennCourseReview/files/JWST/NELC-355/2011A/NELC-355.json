{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5006"}, "description": "The historical books -- Joshua through Kings, Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah--constitute the largest component of the Hebrew Bible, and the questions that these compositions raise are varied and complex. The very definition of these works as \"history\" has been sometimes questioned. The questions refer to their literary nature, their sources, genres and literary structures; their chronological frameworks and their historical and theological presuppositions; their historical backgrounds and credibility, and more. These questions will be raised and discussed through the comparative study of selected texts from the major historical biblical compositions. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "TOPICS BIBLICAL STUDIES: Historical Literature in the Bible", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22143/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS BIBLICAL STUDIES: Historical Literature in the Bible", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-355-401", "path": "/courses/22143/sections/401", "id": "22143-401", "aliases": ["NELC-355-401", "RELS-355-401", "JWST-357-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/22143/sections/401/reviews/68-SARA-JAPHET", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/68-SARA-JAPHET", "first_name": "SARA", "last_name": "JAPHET", "id": "68-SARA-JAPHET", "name": "SARA JAPHET"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "22143-401-68-SARA-JAPHET"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-355", "path": "/courses/22143", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22143/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS BIBLICAL STUDIES: Historical Literature in the Bible", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-355-401", "path": "/courses/22143/sections/401", "id": "22143-401", "aliases": ["NELC-355-401", "RELS-355-401", "JWST-357-401"]}]}, "id": 22143, "aliases": ["NELC-355", "RELS-355", "JWST-357"]}
