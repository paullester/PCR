{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1459"}, "description": "This course will focus primarily on epidoes of external intervention by Great Powers in the politics of Middle Eastern states. We shall begin by examining the emergence of the Middle Eastern state system after the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire in the early part of the 20th century. This discussion will provide opportunities to develop key concepts in the study of international politics and will serve as crucial historical background. We shall then turn our attention to the primary concern of the course - a systematic consideration of the motives, operational results, and long-term implications of a number of important examples of intervention by Great Powers in the Middle East. Among the episodes to be considered will be British policies toward the end of World War I, in Palestine in the 1930s, and, along with the French, in Suez in 1956. Soviet intervention in the first Arab-Israeli war, in 1948, will be analyzed along with Soviet policies toward Egypt in the early 1970s. American intervention in Iran in 1953 and in the Gulf War in 1991 will also be examined. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "INTL POLITICS MIDD EAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8266/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.98", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.37", "rWorkRequired": "2.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.06", "rReadingsValue": "3.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.81", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "INTL POLITICS MIDD EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-253-401", "path": "/courses/8266/sections/401", "id": "8266-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-253-401", "JWST-253-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 82, "path": "/courses/8266/sections/401/reviews/1679-IAN-STEVEN-LUSTICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1679-IAN-STEVEN-LUSTICK", "first_name": "IAN STEVEN", "last_name": "LUSTICK", "id": "1679-IAN-STEVEN-LUSTICK", "name": "IAN STEVEN LUSTICK"}, "num_reviewers": 52, "id": "8266-401-1679-IAN-STEVEN-LUSTICK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-253", "path": "/courses/8266", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8266/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTL POLITICS MIDD EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-253-401", "path": "/courses/8266/sections/401", "id": "8266-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-253-401", "JWST-253-401"]}]}, "id": 8266, "aliases": ["PSCI-253", "JWST-253"]}
