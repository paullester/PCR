{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5007"}, "description": "This seminar will investigate biblical and other precedents for the idea of the messiah and the messianic age, and their interpretation and extension into both ancient Judaism and ancient Christianity. To what degree are Second Temple Jewish and early Christian ideas about the messiah an extension of ancient Israelite concepts? To what degree might they reflect a response or reaction to Hellenistic and Roman imperial ideologies? How (and when) did beliefs surrounding Jesus depart meaningfully from Jewish ideas about the messiah? How do Rabbinic Jewish traditions about the messiah and messianic age differ from their Christian counterparts, and is there evidence of any \"influence\"? These questions will be explored with a focus on primary source readings. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "SEM IN RABBINIC JUDAISM: Messianism - Early Judaism and Christianity", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22146/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.33", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SEM IN RABBINIC JUDAISM: Messianism - Early Judaism and Christianity", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-557-401", "path": "/courses/22146/sections/401", "id": "22146-401", "aliases": ["NELC-557-401", "JWST-553-401", "RELS-557-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/22146/sections/401/reviews/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/61-DAVID-M--STERN", "first_name": "DAVID M.", "last_name": "STERN", "id": "61-DAVID-M--STERN", "name": "DAVID M.
