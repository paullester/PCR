{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3236"}, "description": "The course traces reflections on rabbinic culture produced within Jewish legal literature of the classic rabbinic period - Midrash, Mishna and Talmud - and in later juridical genres - talmudic commentary, codes and responsa. Attention will be paid to the mechanics of different genres, the role played by the underlying prooftext, the inclusion or exclusion of variant opinions, the presence of non-legal information, the balance between precedent and innovation. Reading knowledge of Hebrew is required. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "RABBINIC WRITERS CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30961/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "1.86", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "RABBINIC WRITERS CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-426-401", "path": "/courses/30961/sections/401", "id": "30961-401", "aliases": ["RELS-426-401", "HEBR-486-401", "JWST-426-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/30961/sections/401/reviews/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "first_name": "TALYA", "last_name": "FISHMAN", "id": "1057-TALYA-FISHMAN", "name": "TALYA FISHMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "30961-401-1057-TALYA-FISHMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-426", "path": "/courses/30961", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30961/sections", "values": [{"name": "RABBINIC WRITERS CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-426-401", "path": "/courses/30961/sections/401", "id": "30961-401", "aliases": ["RELS-426-401", "HEBR-486-401", "JWST-426-401"]}]}, "id": 30961, "aliases": ["RELS-426", "HEBR-486", "JWST-426"]}
