{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3399"}, "description": "This course will focus on using the grammar and vocabulary learned at the introductory level to enable students to read Biblical texts independently and take advanced Bible exegesis courses. We will also work on getting comfortable with the standard dictionaries, concordances, and grammars used by scholars of the Bible. We will concentrate on prose this semester, closely reading Ruth, Jonah, and other prose selections. We will begin to translate from English into Biblical Hebrew, and there will also be a unit on the punctuation marks used in the Bible. This is a suitable entry point for students who already have strong Hebrew skills. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "INTER BIB HEBREW:PROSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11929/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "INTER BIB HEBREW:PROSE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-153-401", "path": "/courses/11929/sections/401", "id": "11929-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-153-401", "HEBR-453-401", "JWST-473-401", "JWST-173-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/11929/sections/401/reviews/29-MICHAEL-A--CARASIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/29-MICHAEL-A--CARASIK", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARASIK", "id": "29-MICHAEL-A--CARASIK", "name": "MICHAEL A.
