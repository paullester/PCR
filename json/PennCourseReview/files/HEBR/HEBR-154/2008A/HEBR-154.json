{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3107"}, "description": "This course is a continuation of the Fall semester's Intermediate Biblical Hebrew I. No one will be admitted into the course who has not taken the Fall semester. It will continue to focus on using the grammar and vocabulary learned at the introductory level to enable students to read biblical texts independently and take advanced Bible exegesis courses. We will concentrate this semester on various selections of Biblical poetry, including Exodus 15 and Job 28. We will also continue to translate English prose into Biblical Hebrew. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "INTERMED BIBL HEBREW II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20298/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HEBR-154", "path": "/courses/20298", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20298/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMED BIBL HEBREW II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HEBR-154-401", "path": "/courses/20298/sections/401", "id": "20298-401", "aliases": ["HEBR-154-401", "HEBR-454-401", "JWST-174-401", "JWST-474-401"]}]}, "id": 20298, "aliases": ["HEBR-154", "HEBR-454", "JWST-174", "JWST-474"]}
