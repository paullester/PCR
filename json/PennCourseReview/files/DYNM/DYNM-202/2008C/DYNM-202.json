{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4548"}, "description": "This course discusses the essential structures and issues of leading and operating in the modern workplace. Often these structures-including management, marketing and finance-are treated as silos in which roles and responsbilities take exclusive ownership. The strategic leader and planner,as well as participant, of any organization, whether for profit or not for profit, must develop an overall familiarity and synthesis of meaning of the areas in order to be effective. The issues of leadership will be woven into the discussion using cases. The focus is on the understanding of fundamental characteristics and operation of each area and on the integration of these areas into the strategic planning process that all organizations must go through in order to survive, grow, develop, and prosper. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ORG DYNM/MODRN WKPLCE: Organizational Dynamics in the Modern Workplace", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18501/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "0.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "0.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "ORG DYNM/MODRN WKPLCE: Organizational Dynamics in the Modern Workplace", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-202-001", "path": "/courses/18501/sections/001", "id": "18501-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-202-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/18501/sections/001/reviews/5035-JEAN-MARC-CHOUKROUN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5035-JEAN-MARC-CHOUKROUN", "first_name": "JEAN-MARC", "last_name": "CHOUKROUN", "id": "5035-JEAN-MARC-CHOUKROUN", "name": "JEAN-MARC CHOUKROUN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "18501-001-5035-JEAN-MARC-CHOUKROUN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "DYNM-202", "path": "/courses/18501", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18501/sections", "values": [{"name": "ORG DYNM/MODRN WKPLCE: Organizational Dynamics in the Modern Workplace", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-202-001", "path": "/courses/18501/sections/001", "id": "18501-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-202-001"]}]}, "id": 18501, "aliases": ["DYNM-202"]}
