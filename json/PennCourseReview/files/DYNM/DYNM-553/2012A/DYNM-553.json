{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5407"}, "description": "This course will examins both personal and professional behaviors that constitute effective followership. While the leadership literature is saturated with books on becoming better leaders, there is a dearth of awareness on finding and supporting those who follow those leaders effectively. Students will use surveys from the limited literature on effective followership to profile their own organization's dynamics on styles of followership, and stories of success and failure in confronting organization mistakes and leadership errors will be researched. The outcome of the class will be a personal profile on followership style and an organizational profile on its followership culture. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "BECOMING A COURAGEOUS FOLLOWER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27230/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "BECOMING A COURAGEOUS FOLLOWER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-553-001", "path": "/courses/27230/sections/001", "id": "27230-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-553-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/27230/sections/001/reviews/4774-JOHN-C-ELDRED", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4774-JOHN-C-ELDRED", "first_name": "JOHN C", "last_name": "ELDRED", "id": "4774-JOHN-C-ELDRED", "name": "JOHN C ELDRED"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "27230-001-4774-JOHN-C-ELDRED"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "DYNM-553", "path": "/courses/27230", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27230/sections", "values": [{"name": "BECOMING A COURAGEOUS FOLLOWER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-553-001", "path": "/courses/27230/sections/001", "id": "27230-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-553-001"]}]}, "id": 27230, "aliases": ["DYNM-553"]}
