{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4770"}, "description": "This course will examine how theory guides the effective practice of coaching. Students will be introduced to a theory and model that encompasses a multi-disciplinary approach to coaching in an organizational setting. With this framework as a basis, students will select, research, and present a theoretical model of their own choosing and design a coaching application that demonstrates theory in action. Students will leave the course with an array of theoretical frameworks and practical techniques that will enhance their own coaching capabilities as managers and consultants. Undergraduates may enroll in 500-level courses only with permission of the instructor. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THEORIES, MODELS & PRACTICES THAT INFORM COACHING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30126/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "THEORIES, MODELS & PRACTICES THAT INFORM COACHING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-542-001", "path": "/courses/30126/sections/001", "id": "30126-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-542-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/30126/sections/001/reviews/5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN", "first_name": "RUTH L", "last_name": "ORENSTEIN", "id": "5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN", "name": "RUTH L ORENSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "30126-001-5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "DYNM-542", "path": "/courses/30126", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30126/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORIES, MODELS & PRACTICES THAT INFORM COACHING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-542-001", "path": "/courses/30126/sections/001", "id": "30126-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-542-001"]}]}, "id": 30126, "aliases": ["DYNM-542"]}
