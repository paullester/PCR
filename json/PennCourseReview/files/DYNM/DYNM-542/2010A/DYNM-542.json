{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4770"}, "description": "This course will discuss the importance of theory in guiding the practice of coaching. Students will be introduced to a theory/model that explores a multiple-discipline approach to coaching in an organizational setting. With this framework as a basis, and a subsequent review of an array of theoretical orientations, students will select, research, apply and present a theoretical model of their own choosing. Their model will provide the framework that informs their coaching and/or use their thought and practice in their roles at work. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "THEORIES & MODELS COACH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25860/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "THEORIES & MODELS COACH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-542-001", "path": "/courses/25860/sections/001", "id": "25860-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-542-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/25860/sections/001/reviews/5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN", "first_name": "RUTH L", "last_name": "ORENSTEIN", "id": "5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN", "name": "RUTH L ORENSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "25860-001-5105-RUTH-L-ORENSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "DYNM-542", "path": "/courses/25860", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25860/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORIES & MODELS COACH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-542-001", "path": "/courses/25860/sections/001", "id": "25860-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-542-001"]}]}, "id": 25860, "aliases": ["DYNM-542"]}
