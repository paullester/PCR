{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4770"}, "description": "This course will discuss the importance of theory in guiding the practice of coaching. Students will be introduced to a theory/model that explores a multiple-discipline approach to coaching in an organizational setting. With this framework as a basis, and a subsequent review of an array of theoretical orientations, students will select, research, apply and present a theoretical model of their own choosing. Their model will provide the framework that informs their coaching and/or use their thought and practice in their roles at work. \n\n", "semester": "2008B", "name": "THEORIES & MODELS COACH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19498/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "DYNM-542", "path": "/courses/19498", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19498/sections", "values": [{"name": "THEORIES & MODELS COACH", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "DYNM-542-900", "path": "/courses/19498/sections/900", "id": "19498-900", "aliases": ["DYNM-542-900"]}]}, "id": 19498, "aliases": ["DYNM-542"]}
