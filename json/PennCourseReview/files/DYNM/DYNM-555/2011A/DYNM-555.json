{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4931"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to engage students in an experience of collective innovation and apply that innovation to potentially alleviate a sustainability problem in the Penn community. Students will be working on real projects that relate to the sustainability challenges within the Penn community. They will be asked to immerse themselves into the social system they will be studying through interviews and other activities to gain \"situation awareness\" then experiencing practices for reflection, after which they will look for prototype innovation solutions to emerge. These prototype solutions will then be ready for implementation subject to university review. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "LDR & SUSTAINABILITY: Leadership & Sustainability:How to Engage in Collaborative Innovation", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21519/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "2.25", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "LDR & SUSTAINABILITY: Leadership & Sustainability:How to Engage in Collaborative Innovation", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-555-001", "path": "/courses/21519/sections/001", "id": "21519-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-555-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/21519/sections/001/reviews/5331-DANIEL-K-GAROFALO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5331-DANIEL-K-GAROFALO", "first_name": "DANIEL K", "last_name": "GAROFALO", "id": "5331-DANIEL-K-GAROFALO", "name": "DANIEL K GAROFALO"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "21519-001-5331-DANIEL-K-GAROFALO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "1.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "1.25", "rInstructorQuality": "1.75"}, "section": {"name": "LDR & SUSTAINABILITY: Leadership & Sustainability:How to Engage in Collaborative Innovation", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-555-001", "path": "/courses/21519/sections/001", "id": "21519-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-555-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/21519/sections/001/reviews/5332-FRANK-E--NUESSLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5332-FRANK-E--NUESSLE", "first_name": "FRANK E.", "last_name": "NUESSLE", "id": "5332-FRANK-E--NUESSLE", "name": "FRANK E.
