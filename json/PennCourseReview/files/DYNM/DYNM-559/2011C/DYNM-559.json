Globalization, technology, and vastly improved communications have increasingly led to \"Winner Take All\" markets. Consider the local opera house: 100 years ago, Iowa alone had more than 1,500 of them. Thousands of sopranos earned adequate, if modest, livings from the live performances, but now, thanks to i-pods, the world's best soprano can be literally everywhere at once. And since it costs no more to transmit MP3s of Renee Fleming's Mozart arias than her understudy's, most opera fans listen to Fleming. Thus, Fleming earns several million dollars a year while most other sopranos, many of whom are almost as talented, struggle to get by. The same is increasingly true of other professions: Those who are recognized for being the best at what they do can sell their services anywhere and everywhere at top dollar, whereas those who lack such recognition find their services valued less and less--if they are valued at all. As graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania, you have an extraordinary opportunity to become the leading expert in a given domain in a few short years, maybe less. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "KNOWLEDGE WORK: BECOMING AN AUTHORITY IN YOUR FIELD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24237/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "KNOWLEDGE WORK: BECOMING AN AUTHORITY IN YOUR FIELD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-559-001", "path": "/courses/24237/sections/001", "id": "24237-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-559-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/24237/sections/001/reviews/5732-STEVEN-FREEMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5732-STEVEN-FREEMAN", "first_name": "STEVEN", "last_name": "FREEMAN", "id": "5732-STEVEN-FREEMAN", "name": "STEVEN FREEMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "24237-001-5732-STEVEN-FREEMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "DYNM-559", "path": "/courses/24237", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24237/sections", "values": [{"name": "KNOWLEDGE WORK: BECOMING AN AUTHORITY IN YOUR FIELD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "DYNM-559-001", "path": "/courses/24237/sections/001", "id": "24237-001", "aliases": ["DYNM-559-001"]}]}, "id": 24237, "aliases": ["DYNM-559"]}
