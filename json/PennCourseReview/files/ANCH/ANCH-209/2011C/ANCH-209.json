{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5174"}, "description": "\"They create a desert and call it peace,\" wrote Tacitus in describing the response of the conquered to Rome's power, but the Roman Peace also broughtwith it it other, less dramatic changes. In this class we will break the Roman Empire down down into a series of vignettes, using literature and archaeology to supply us us with the material for a fresh look at Roman society. Our aim isto uncover the complexity of Roman society, and to acknowledge the multiple voices that together made up the ancient Mediterranean world. We will focus upon key key structural aspects of Roman society and culture, but explore them in new ways, using texts texts that highlight dissent, conflict and tension as as they indicate cohesion and Rome's hegemony over the Mediterranean in in antiquity. Texts will be read in translation. No prerequisites, although students are encouraged to take this course after taking ANCH 027/HIST 027.
