{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5504"}, "description": "Livia, the first empress of Rome, is a critical figure for our understanding of Roman women at the transitional moment between Republic and Empire. As the most publicly celebrated woman of Augustus' household, Livia is an opportune figure through which to examine a variety of Augustan and early imperial texts and monuments. \n\nThis course will survey Livia's different literary and material representations and attempt to come to terms with the various perspectives on the first empress presented by these texts and contexts. Livia provides a key figure through whom students will be exposed to various issues surrounding the portrayal of Roman women in the early empire. Through lecture and discussion, we will relate Livia to her contemporary world, and then examine the role of imperial women through the rest of the Julio-Claudian era and beyond. We will discover Livia's influence in creating the role of the empress, and analyze the differences between her representation as an ideal and that of later imperial women. Students will write brief response papers to primary texts and present on select secondary readings that add to our understanding of the portrayal of Livia and imperial women more generally. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "WOMEN IN IMPERIAL ROME", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28503/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN IN IMPERIAL ROME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-212-401", "path": "/courses/28503/sections/401", "id": "28503-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-212-401", "CLST-213-401", "GSWS-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/28503/sections/401/reviews/4861-CAITLIN-C-GILLESPIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4861-CAITLIN-C-GILLESPIE", "first_name": "CAITLIN C", "last_name": "GILLESPIE", "id": "4861-CAITLIN-C-GILLESPIE", "name": "CAITLIN C GILLESPIE"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "28503-401-4861-CAITLIN-C-GILLESPIE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANCH-212", "path": "/courses/28503", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28503/sections", "values": [{"name": "WOMEN IN IMPERIAL ROME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-212-401", "path": "/courses/28503/sections/401", "id": "28503-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-212-401", "CLST-213-401", "GSWS-212-401"]}]}, "id": 28503, "aliases": ["ANCH-212", "CLST-213", "GSWS-212"]}
