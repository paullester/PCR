{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5505"}, "description": "In this course, we will study the rise and development of Macedonia from a tiny kingdom on the northern fringes of the Greek world to one of the major powers of the region and beyond. Regarded by the Greeks as an at least semi-barbarian culture on the periphery, Macedonia became the dominant power inthe Greek world during the fourth century BC and its king Alexander the Great set out to conquer the world. After his death, Macedonia was one of the Hellenistic kingdoms competing for power and influence in the Mediterranean until it finally came under Roman control. Topics that will be discussed include questions of ethnicity and identity, Macedonian kingship, culture and society (including the role of women) and the role of Macedonian traditions in the Hellenistic era in general. Special emphasis will be laid on the discussion of ancient texts and documents as well as archaeological evidence. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "The Rise and Decline of Macedonia", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28504/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.33", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "The Rise and Decline of Macedonia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-330-401", "path": "/courses/28504/sections/401", "id": "28504-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-330-401", "CLST-332-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/28504/sections/401/reviews/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "first_name": "JULIA L.", "last_name": "WILKER", "id": "5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "name": "JULIA L.
