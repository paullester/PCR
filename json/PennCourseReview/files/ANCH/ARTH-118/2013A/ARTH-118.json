{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5614"}, "description": "By using as its focus the famous Seven Wonders of the World, in addition to study of similar wonders which did not make this canonical list, the course will provide an overview of the history and civilizations of the ancient Near East and Greece through the Hellenistic Period (ca. 3000-200 BC). The course will explore the ancient civilizations that created the Seven Wonders: Egypt (The Great Pyramids and the Lighthouse of Alexandria), Mesopotamia (the Hanging Gardens of Babylon), and Greece (the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia). In addition, the course will examine several ancient wonders that did not make the famous list. The additional wonders include the ziggurat of Ur, the labyrinthine palace of Minos at Knossos, the tomb of King Tutankhamen, the citadel of Homeric Troy, Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, and Darius the Great's royal center at Persepolis. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "WONDERS OF THE ANC WRLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29873/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.46", "rCourseQuality": "2.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorQuality": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "WONDERS OF THE ANC WRLD", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-118-601", "path": "/courses/29873/sections/601", "id": "29873-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-118-601", "HIST-110-601", "ANCH-118-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/29873/sections/601/reviews/6251-MIRIAM-G--CLINTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6251-MIRIAM-G--CLINTON", "first_name": "MIRIAM G.", "last_name": "CLINTON", "id": "6251-MIRIAM-G--CLINTON", "name": "MIRIAM G.
