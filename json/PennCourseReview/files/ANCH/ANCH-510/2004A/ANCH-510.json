{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2720"}, "description": "The analysis of non-literary Latin texts from antiquity preserved on various types of permanent media, mainly stone and metal, is the primary concern of the discipline of Latin epigraphy. Such texts, which have been recovered in hundreds of thousands, constitute one of the most important sources of data for the modern-day historian of Rome. The student will be introduced to the conventions of editing and reading epigraphical texts, and to the major collections of Latin inscriptions. The seminar will then concentrate on different types of documents in order to understand their formatting and style, as well as the kinds of historical evidence that can be derived from them. Public and private inscriptions, from the decrees of emperors and senatorial careers to personal curse tablets and the simple tombstone epitaphs of the urban poor, will be considered as examples of the range of epigraphical texts available to the modern researcher. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "LATIN HISTORIC DOCUMENTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6129/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANCH-510", "path": "/courses/6129", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6129/sections", "values": [{"name": "LATIN HISTORIC DOCUMENTS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-510-401", "path": "/courses/6129/sections/401", "id": "6129-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-510-401", "LATN-510-401"]}]}, "id": 6129, "aliases": ["ANCH-510", "LATN-510"]}
