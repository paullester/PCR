{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3324"}, "description": "What constituted history in ancient Greece and Rome? What claims to knowledge did history make, and how did these differ from other forms of knowledge? How did historians envision their task, and how did they go about performing it? We will read the works of the major Greek and Roman historians in translation in an attempt to answer those questions. Other issues to consider include the origins and development of historical writing, the place of history within the ancient literary tradition, and the similarities and differences between the ancient and modern practice of history. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "WRTG HIST IN GREECE&ROME", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21485/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "WRTG HIST IN GREECE&ROME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-312-401", "path": "/courses/21485/sections/401", "id": "21485-401", "aliases": ["CLST-312-401", "ANCH-312-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/21485/sections/401/reviews/4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON", "first_name": "CYNTHIA", "last_name": "DAMON", "id": "4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON", "name": "CYNTHIA DAMON"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "21485-401-4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-312", "path": "/courses/21485", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21485/sections", "values": [{"name": "WRTG HIST IN GREECE&ROME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-312-401", "path": "/courses/21485/sections/401", "id": "21485-401", "aliases": ["CLST-312-401", "ANCH-312-401"]}]}, "id": 21485, "aliases": ["CLST-312", "ANCH-312"]}
