{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3269"}, "description": "The history of the ancient Mediterranean world did not finish with the emergence of the first Christian emperor, Constantine, as sole ruler of the Roman world in 324 CE. Nor did the deposition of the last western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 CE, signal the definitive decline and fall of Rome. There continued to be a Roman empire and a Roman emperor for many centuries to come. This course examines the history of the Mediterranean world in a crucial period of transformation between the political, social, and economic structures of the classical world and those of the medieval period. Our chronological boundaries, broadly speaking, are the third to the sixth centuries CE. The geographical scope of the course includes interactions with the powers of the Near East and Hunnic nomads, as well as the transformation of the Roman provinces of the western Mediterranean into the Germanic kingdoms of the early medieval world. \n\nWe explore the development of new religious, political, and socio-economic structures, new intellectual, artistic, and literary styles and concerns. Equally, we note enduring continuities and inheritances from the world of the first and second centuries CE. What emerges is a world in transition, reconstituting and reinterpreting its past with a view to the new opportunities and demands of its present. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "LATE ANTIQUE ROME", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8485/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "LATE ANTIQUE ROME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-028-401", "path": "/courses/8485/sections/401", "id": "8485-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-028-401", "HIST-028-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/8485/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "first_name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH", "last_name": "GREY", "id": "2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "8485-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANCH-028", "path": "/courses/8485", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8485/sections", "values": [{"name": "LATE ANTIQUE ROME", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-028-401", "path": "/courses/8485/sections/401", "id": "8485-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-028-401", "HIST-028-401"]}]}, "id": 8485, "aliases": ["ANCH-028", "HIST-028"]}
