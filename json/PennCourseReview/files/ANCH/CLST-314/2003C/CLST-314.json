{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2248"}, "description": "Roman magistrates, emperors, jurists, and lawyers developed many of the fundamental legal principles that have remained at the basis of our modern legal systems. This course will introduce the students to the principal sources of the Roman law, to the nature of legal actions and trial procedures (for both civil litigation and criminal prosecution), and also to the main institutions of the legal system. there will be strong emphasis on the basic principles and norms of the Roman law itself. The main areas of the civil law that will be dealt with in detail will include the law of persons, succession, obligations (including contracts and damage), delicts and 'crimes'. The application of the law in social contexts will be studied by the consideration of historically documented cases such as a murder trial, a dispute over a sale, and divorce proceedings. The analysis of model cases will also be an important part of each student's involvement in the class. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "ROMAN LAW AND SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3914/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.42", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.65", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorQuality": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "ROMAN LAW AND SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-314-401", "path": "/courses/3914/sections/401", "id": "3914-401", "aliases": ["CLST-314-401", "HIST-314-401", "ANCH-314-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/3914/sections/401/reviews/82-BRENT-D--SHAW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/82-BRENT-D--SHAW", "first_name": "BRENT D.", "last_name": "SHAW", "id": "82-BRENT-D--SHAW", "name": "BRENT D.
