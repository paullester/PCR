{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/274"}, "description": "The Elgin marbles should be returned to Greece. The Elgin marbles should stay in the British Museum. Who should have Schliemann's treasure: Russia, Germany, or Turkey? Are wealthy private collectors causing our world heritage to be dug up illicitly, thereby destroying valuable information, or are they providing a necessary service to the world by maintaining in good environments and with proper care the world's patrimony? Who has a right to own the past? These questions and related issues that are currently under heated debate among archaeologists, private collectors, ethnic groups, institutions and governments will be explored over the course of 15 meetings. Discussions will include ethical codes and professional responsibility; state, national and international legislation; the roles of the press (both academic and popular), of the individual, of universities and museums, of governments and of special interest groups. Case studies will focus on primarily on materials from the Mediterranean basin and Europe, but may expand out to the Americas, Asia, Austrailia and Africa. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "Who Owns the Past?
