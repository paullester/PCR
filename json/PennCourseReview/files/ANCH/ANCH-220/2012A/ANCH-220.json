{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5362"}, "description": "In this course, we will study the history of the Hellenistic and Roman period a Near Eastern perspective. From the conquests of Alexander the Great to the end of Roman rule in late antiquity, this region was the scene of conflicts, but also of peaceful and fruitful interactions between Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Jews, Syrians, Arabs and many other societies. What was the impact of Greek and Roman rule and how did the inhabitants of the region react to these fundamental changes? On the other hand, how did they influence the culture and worldview of their conquerors? We will use historical texts, documents and archaeological evidence to discuss the political, cultural and religious encounters that made the Near East a key region of Greco-Roman Greco-Roman history. All texts will be discussed in translation. No prerequisites, although it would be useful to have taken ANCH 026 and/or ANCH 027. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Near East in Hellenistic and Roman Times", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26934/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "Near East in Hellenistic and Roman Times", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-220-401", "path": "/courses/26934/sections/401", "id": "26934-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-220-401", "NELC-284-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/26934/sections/401/reviews/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "first_name": "JULIA L.", "last_name": "WILKER", "id": "5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "name": "JULIA L.
