The course, based on primary source readings, focused heavily on literature and details about \u201cpottery, trade, philosophy, etc,\u201d rather than actual historical events. \r\n\r\nStudent\u2019s feelings about Professor McInerney were mixed. While some students commented that it was \u201cone of the greatest teaching performances [they] have witnessed at this university,\u201d and many called Professor McInerney an \u201camazing lecturer,\u201d some students found it difficult to approach Professor McInerney with questions or comments. All students agreed that lectures were \u201cinteresting, informative, and highly entertaining\u201d but a few students interpreted his \u201ctheatrics\u201d as \u201carrogance\u201d and were turned off by his demeanor.  Many praised Professor McInerney for his \u201canimation\u201d and ability to stimulate student interest.\r\n\r\nAlthough students learned a lot in the course, many commented that the heavy workload and harsh grading of papers made the course too difficult for non-classical studies majors taking the course as a general elective. A few commented that though they worked hard in the course, they didn\u2019t feel like their progress was rewarded when it came time to receive grades.  This course was recommended for majors or students greatly interested in Greek history. The class fulfills the History & Tradition Sector and there are no prerequisites. \r\n", "num_students": 262, "path": "/courses/16919/sections/401/reviews/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "MCINERNEY", "id": "84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "name": "JEREMY MCINERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 238, "id": "16919-401-84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY"}]
