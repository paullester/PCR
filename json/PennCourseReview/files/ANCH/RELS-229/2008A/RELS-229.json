{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4840"}, "description": "This course will deal with the Jewish culture of magic in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. It will focus on two aspects: how was Jewish magic characterized within the evidence provided by \"insiders,\" namely practitioners, and how was it described and presented in \"outsider\" accounts, mainly rabbinic sources. We will examine magical artifacts such as amulets and magic bowls, as well as manuals and treatises of magic. The course explores the beliefs, practices and aims of Jewish magic activity. At the same time, we will delve into the political question of accusations of magic and their role in the struggle of the religious elites for monopoly over holiness and ritual power. All course materials will be in English. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "EARLY JEWISH MAGIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20781/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "EARLY JEWISH MAGIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-229-401", "path": "/courses/20781/sections/401", "id": "20781-401", "aliases": ["RELS-229-401", "ANCH-230-401", "NELC-289-401", "FOLK-129-401", "JWST-229-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/20781/sections/401/reviews/5181-YUVAL-HARARI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5181-YUVAL-HARARI", "first_name": "YUVAL", "last_name": "HARARI", "id": "5181-YUVAL-HARARI", "name": "YUVAL HARARI"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "20781-401-5181-YUVAL-HARARI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-229", "path": "/courses/20781", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20781/sections", "values": [{"name": "EARLY JEWISH MAGIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-229-401", "path": "/courses/20781/sections/401", "id": "20781-401", "aliases": ["RELS-229-401", "ANCH-230-401", "NELC-289-401", "FOLK-129-401", "JWST-229-401"]}]}, "id": 20781, "aliases": ["RELS-229", "ANCH-230", "NELC-289", "FOLK-129", "JWST-229"]}
