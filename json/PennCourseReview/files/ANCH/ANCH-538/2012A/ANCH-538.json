{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5363"}, "description": "The history of the Jewish people in the Greek and Roman world has often been interpreted as a history dominated by conflict and hostility. Other approaches, however, have questioned these concepts as too simplistic. In this seminar, we will discuss the social, political, cultural and religious interaction between Jews and non-Jews from the Hellenistic period until the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism. Special emphasis will be laid upon questions of identity, antagonism and coexistence in the diaspora as well as in Judea. Based upon literary, documentary and archaeological sources, topics to be covered include Jewish self-definitions in a predominantly pagan world, different modes of integration, Jewish receptions of Greco-Roman culture, and perceptions of Jews by non-Jewish authors. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Jews in the Greek and Roman World", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26935/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "Jews in the Greek and Roman World", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-538-401", "path": "/courses/26935/sections/401", "id": "26935-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-538-401", "JWST-538-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/26935/sections/401/reviews/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "first_name": "JULIA L.", "last_name": "WILKER", "id": "5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "name": "JULIA L.
