{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5190"}, "description": "For centuries the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome have been considered the \"foundation\" of Western society, and the influence of Classical Antiquities continues to be felt in central areas of modern life, from art and literature to politics and science. Yet in recent years the Greco-Roman Classics have become the center of a vibrant debate about our very definition of \"western civilization\" and the values and attitudes that this concept traditionally entails. This course will introduce students to the amazingly rich and dynamic cultures of Classical Antiquity, allowing them to experience many of the most exciting aspects of ancient culture, and to evaluate for themselves the legacy of the classical past in the West. The course will involve, among other things, the study of various aspects of Greco-Roman history, literature, art, philosophy, and politics. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ANCIENT ROME AND AMERICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24197/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "3.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.10", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ANCIENT ROME AND AMERICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-115-401", "path": "/courses/24197/sections/401", "id": "24197-401", "aliases": ["CLST-115-401", "ANCH-115-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/24197/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "first_name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH", "last_name": "GREY", "id": "2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "24197-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-115", "path": "/courses/24197", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24197/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANCIENT ROME AND AMERICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-115-401", "path": "/courses/24197/sections/401", "id": "24197-401", "aliases": ["CLST-115-401", "ANCH-115-401"]}]}, "id": 24197, "aliases": ["CLST-115", "ANCH-115"]}
