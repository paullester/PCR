{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5311"}, "description": "\"They create a desert and call it peace,\" wrote Tacitus in describing the response of the conquered to Rome's power, but the Roman Peace also brought with it other, less dramatic changes. In this class we will concentrate on the experience of Roman culture. What was it like to be a Greek ex-slave and millionaire living in Rome in the age of Nero? How were the Gallic chieftains made into Roman senators? What was the Roman governor of Asia Minor expected to do when the provincials wanted a new aqueduct? We will break the Roman Empire down into a series of vignettes, using literature and archaeology to supply us with the material for a fresh look at Roman Society. What emerges is a culture more diverse, more flexible and more tolerant than is usually recognized. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "THE ROMAN EMPIRE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25823/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.32", "rRecommendMajor": "3.68", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.59", "rInstructorAccess": "3.32", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.68", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "THE ROMAN EMPIRE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-145-401", "path": "/courses/25823/sections/401", "id": "25823-401", "aliases": ["CLST-145-401", "ANCH-145-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/25823/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "first_name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH", "last_name": "GREY", "id": "2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "25823-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-145", "path": "/courses/25823", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25823/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE ROMAN EMPIRE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CLST-145-401", "path": "/courses/25823/sections/401", "id": "25823-401", "aliases": ["CLST-145-401", "ANCH-145-401"]}]}, "id": 25823, "aliases": ["CLST-145", "ANCH-145"]}
