{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2766"}, "description": "Rhetoric and the Community is a class designed to improve the quality of students' speaking abilities. Through debates, impromptu speeches and various other types of oral reports, students will develop their skills as speakers. The emphasis here is on practical advice, constant positive criticism and an active exploration of the art of oratory. We will emphasize the role of effective oral communication in contributing to a higher level of engagement and discourse in the community. This class will particularly help those planning careers in advocacy, public service, teaching and other areas where confident, thoughtful, and articulate communication are important. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "RHETORIC & THE COMMUNITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6321/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.55", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "3.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.55", "rCommAbility": "3.91", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "RHETORIC & THE COMMUNITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-353-301", "path": "/courses/6321/sections/301", "id": "6321-301", "aliases": ["CLST-353-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/6321/sections/301/reviews/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "MCINERNEY", "id": "84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "name": "JEREMY MCINERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "6321-301-84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CLST-353", "path": "/courses/6321", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6321/sections", "values": [{"name": "RHETORIC & THE COMMUNITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "CLST-353-301", "path": "/courses/6321/sections/301", "id": "6321-301", "aliases": ["CLST-353-301"]}]}, "id": 6321, "aliases": ["CLST-353"]}
