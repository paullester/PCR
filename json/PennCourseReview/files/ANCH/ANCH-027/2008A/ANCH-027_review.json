The ancient Greeks were renowned for their accomplishments in disciplines such as democracy, philosophy, art, literature and drama. Contrastingly, the ancient Romans focused more on ruling their expansive empire and maintaining their imperialist grasp in the Mediterranean region of the world. This course examines the conquests, military campaigns, and decrees of the ancient Roman civilization from the year 300 B.C. to 0. Further topics include the socioeconomic and sociopolitical ramifications of ruling such an expansive empire as well as the transformation of the Roman Republic (Senate rule) into the Principate (emperor rule). The military, cultural, and political limits of Roman rule are also examined. Furthermore, the course examines the inception and evolution of a distinctive Roman culture, namely novel forms of literature (such as satire) and entertainment such as the gladiatorial arena.     \r\n\r\nSome students remarked that the Power Points in lecture were hard to follow and occasionally included superfluous information that made the course \u201cdry.\u201d One student mentioned that they would have liked Professor Grey to \u201ctalk more about the end of the empire.\u201d One student claimed that the course \u201cseemed to require background knowledge that was advanced for an introductory course.\u201d Similarly, another student mentioned \u201cfor an introductory history course, I felt that there was too much time spent analyzing literary tradition.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents praised Professor Grey for his \u201carticulate\u201d communication style and engaging lectures.
