Some felt that the class wasn\u2019t very coherent as it, \u201cwandered aimlessly through Roman history.\u201d Some others mentioned that the readings were \u201cexcessively dry\u201d and that there was simply too much reading to keep up on. Still, many of the students loved the class, saying that Professor McInerney\u2019s lectures \u201cblend the witty and provocative, the ancient and modern, to spur the interest of both classics majors and engineers. \u201c\r\n\r\nWhile some students had mixed feelings about the class, everyone agreed that Professor McInerney was an amazing teacher. Many said he was a \u201cdamn good professor\u201d and is \u201cone of the best at Penn\u201d. Many students remarked that he constantly seemed to be in a good mood and that he was always ready to spice up the lectures with a joke or two.

Still, another student said that \u201cas long as you stay on top of the readings and do the few papers that there are (one response paper, a term paper and a midterm in class essay) and do well on the final, it\u2019s a really enjoyable class.\u201d", "num_students": 236, "path": "/courses/15302/sections/401/reviews/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "first_name": "JEREMY", "last_name": "MCINERNEY", "id": "84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY", "name": "JEREMY MCINERNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 221, "id": "15302-401-84-JEREMY-MCINERNEY"}]
