The subject matter includes the social, economic, and political structure of the empire. The course will also discuss the conquest, warfare, administration, and law that made the empire possible and the military, cultural, and religious challenges that threatened it. The timeline of the course material stretches from the creation of the Roman Empire to the last three centuries BC. Focus is placed on the political structure of the Roman Empire and its transition from Republic to Principate. This course will also explore the creation of a single Roman culture through its forms of literature (such as satire), entertainment (such as gladiatorial arenas), and other aspects that contributed to the creation of a Roman social order. \r\n\r\nStudents found this course very informative. Many summed up the course as \u201cwonderful,\u201d \u201cgreat course,\u201d or \u201cinteresting and fun.\u201d However, the material was very overwhelming to some students as the course covers \u201c500 years of Roman history while still attempting to focus on themes and culture rather than events.\u201d Therefore, many students found the course to contain a great deal of information in a short period of time, and was a \u201crigorous survey of Ancient Rome\u201d as not as introductory as the course name suggests. \r\n\r\nProfessor Grey received mixed reviews from students. Many found the Powerpoint slides to be confusing out of context and also found the professor himself to be confusing at times. However, many students agreed that \u201cDr. Grey is an outstanding teacher\u201d and cited his \u201cwonderful\u201d lectures and \u201centhusiasm for the material.\u201d Students were similarly impressed by the Professor\u2019s preparation for class and energy throughout the lecture. Although some commented that the lectures were \u201cnot helpful at all,\u201d many students disagreed and found his lectures to be extremely entertaining and engaging, and said that the course was \u201cpretty easy...[and Grey is] funny, comfortable, and a great storyteller.\u201d \r\n\r\nAlthough many students took this course to fulfill the History and Tradition Sector (and a majority were freshman), many commented that the course should not be directed at non-majors due to the extensive course material and readings. The vast majority of students noted that the readings were quite extensive and the material covered was \u201ctoo much for an introductory course.\u201d Many students even questioned the importance of the readings because they did not understand their connection to the material presented during lecture. Some students even went so far as to state that the \u201ccourse required an unrealistic amount of reading, some of which was not entirely necessary to do well in the class [but instead] hinder[ed] students\u2019 ability to focus on subject matter.\u201d However, overall students found Professor Grey\u2019s tests and assignments \u201cfair\u201d and the expectations \u201creasonable and clearly stated.\u201d Some students were displeased with their grades, as there is no curve. Some also found the \u201cexam grading was a little bit arbitrary.\u201d However, many students found that this course was \u201ca great intro to Roman history.\u201d In addition, students were pleased with what they learned and felt prepared for their exams.", "num_students": 154, "path": "/courses/25574/sections/401/reviews/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "first_name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH", "last_name": "GREY", "id": "2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY", "name": "CAMPBELL AINSWORTH GREY"}, "num_reviewers": 140, "id": "25574-401-2844-CAMPBELL-AINSWORTH-GREY"}]
