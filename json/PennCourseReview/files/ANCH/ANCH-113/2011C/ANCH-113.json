{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5067"}, "description": "The neat, comforting narratives that we construct of the histories of ancient Greece and Rome cover up a collection of controversies and debates that continue to rage in contemporary scholarship. Can we use the Homeric epics as sources of early Greek history? Who was responsible for the Peloponnesian War? How can we best explain Rome's acquisition of empire? How new was the political revolution of Augustus? What were the main reasons for the rise of Christianity? In this course, we explore these and other controversies, focusing on both modern scholarship and the ancient sources. All texts will be discussed in translation. No prior knowledge of Ancient History is required, although it would be useful to have taken ANCH 026 and/or ANCH 027. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Introduction to Greek and Roman History", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23952/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "Introduction to Greek and Roman History", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANCH-113-401", "path": "/courses/23952/sections/401", "id": "23952-401", "aliases": ["ANCH-113-401", "CLST-113-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/23952/sections/401/reviews/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "first_name": "JULIA L.", "last_name": "WILKER", "id": "5702-JULIA-L--WILKER", "name": "JULIA L.
