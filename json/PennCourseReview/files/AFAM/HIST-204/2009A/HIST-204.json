The creation of this website is the basis of the seminar. Students will engage in research and contribute critical texts to the website which is intended to be a virtual heritage museum for members of the West Philadelphia community as well as and educational resource.\r\nStudents were generally disappointed with \u201cWest Philadelphia Community History.\u201d While a few praised the valuable research skills they gained and a solid number expressed satisfaction with their outside-the-classroom experience, most felt the class did not meet its potential. Some students observed that their classmates did not take the course seriously, noting a lot of absences and lack of preparation for discussions. One student said it was \u201cby far the most lax\u201d of the history seminars taken. Students appreciate that they learned a lot about researching and interviewing. Most students felt the work they did outside of class \u2014 such as \u201cgetting out in West Philadelphia and meeting community leaders\u201d \u2014 was most valuable and enjoyable. One student noted that the majority of things learned from the course happened outside of the classroom.&#8232;&#8232;\r\nIn general the reviews of Professor Lloyd and Professor Engs were not positive. Students noted that both professors seemed to come to class unprepared, without having much to talk about or have students discuss. They did not feel that class time was used productively; even a student who called the class \u201cgreat\u201d thought class time should be cut in half. One said that \u201cgoing to class was a complete waste of my time.\u201d\r\nSome students complained about the lack of direction for the course, such as not getting a proper syllabus and not receiving clear instructions for the final paper. &#8232;While students say the class is not hard, it does involve time commitment outside of class for research and interviewing.
