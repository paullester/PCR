{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1156"}, "description": "Despite advances in social justice engendered by Civil Rights legislation of the 1960s and 1970s, institutional racism persists. Public and scholarly works identify contemporary institutional discrimination in racial profiling by law enforcement officials, unequal access to health care institutions, and continued housing segregation and its byproducts of unequal educational opportunity and community resources. The purpose of this course is for students to learn about the complexity of racism in America: the construction of racial and ethnic categories, the impact of racism and discrimination on individuals and social institutions, and the influence of oppressive policies and practices on social welfare systems and clients. Students learn about forms and patterns of social and economic injustice based on race, ethnicity, and other ascribed group characteristics that impact American social systems at individual and, particularly, institutional levels. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "AMERICAN RACISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1165/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.65", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.76", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "3.81", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "3.81", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "AMERICAN RACISM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "AFAM-097-001", "path": "/courses/1165/sections/001", "id": "1165-001", "aliases": ["AFAM-097-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/1165/sections/001/reviews/1218-WALTER-D-PALMER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1218-WALTER-D-PALMER", "first_name": "WALTER D", "last_name": "PALMER", "id": "1218-WALTER-D-PALMER", "name": "WALTER D PALMER"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "1165-001-1218-WALTER-D-PALMER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFAM-097", "path": "/courses/1165", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1165/sections", "values": [{"name": "AMERICAN RACISM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "AFAM-097-001", "path": "/courses/1165/sections/001", "id": "1165-001", "aliases": ["AFAM-097-001"]}]}, "id": 1165, "aliases": ["AFAM-097"]}
