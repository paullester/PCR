It examines the way people reflect on and represent various aspects and issues in their daily lives, in public media, and through a diverse range of performative and creative outlets. It explores the way cultural traditions are created, promulgated, and perpetuated. It looks at the way popular culture deals with pleasure and pain; identity difference and diversity; wealth and power; modernity and history; gender relations; suppression, resistance, and violence; and local versus global processes. In short, popular culture will serve as a window through which to observe contemporary life. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "POP CULTURE IN AFRICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15307/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "POP CULTURE IN AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-018-401", "path": "/courses/15307/sections/401", "id": "15307-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-018-401", "AFRC-018-401", "AFST-018-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/15307/sections/401/reviews/96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES", "first_name": "SANDRA THEIS", "last_name": "BARNES", "id": "96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES", "name": "SANDRA THEIS BARNES"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "15307-401-96-SANDRA-THEIS-BARNES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-018", "path": "/courses/15307", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15307/sections", "values": [{"name": "POP CULTURE IN AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-018-401", "path": "/courses/15307/sections/401", "id": "15307-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-018-401", "AFRC-018-401", "AFST-018-401"]}]}, "id": 15307, "aliases": ["ANTH-018", "AFRC-018", "AFST-018"]}
