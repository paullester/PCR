{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1138"}, "description": "Urban development has been influenced by religious conceptions of social and economic justice. Progressive traditions within various evolving traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Humanism, have yielded powerful critiques of oppression and hierarchy as well as alternative economic frameworks for ownership, governance, production, labor, and community.
