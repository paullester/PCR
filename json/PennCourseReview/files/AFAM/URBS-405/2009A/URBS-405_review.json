Progressive traditions within Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Humanism have yielded: (1) powerful critiques of oppression and hierarchy as well as (2) alternative economic frameworks for ownership, governance, production, labor, and community. Historical and contemporary case studies from the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East will be considered, as we examine the ways in which religious responses to poverty, inequality, and ecological destruction have generated new forms of urban development.\r\n\r\nIn general, students thoroughly enjoyed Professor Lamas\u2019s class.
