{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1138"}, "description": "Urban development has been influenced by religious conceptions of social and economic justice. Progressive traditions within various evolving traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Humanism, have yielded powerful critiques of oppression and hierarchy as well as alternative economic frameworks for ownership, governance, production, labor, and community. Historical and contemporary case studies from the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East will be considered, as we examine the ways in which religiously and philosophically informed responses topoverty, inequality, and ecological destruction have generated new forms of urban development. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "RELIG,SOC JUST & URB DEV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1138/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.89", "rDifficulty": "2.61", "rStimulateInterest": "3.93", "rRecommendMajor": "3.96", "rCourseQuality": "3.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.61", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.89", "rCommAbility": "3.85", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "RELIG,SOC JUST & URB DEV", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-405-601", "path": "/courses/1138/sections/601", "id": "1138-601", "aliases": ["URBS-405-601", "RELS-439-601", "HIST-405-601", "AFAM-405-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/1138/sections/601/reviews/1202-ANDREW-T--LAMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1202-ANDREW-T--LAMAS", "first_name": "ANDREW T.", "last_name": "LAMAS", "id": "1202-ANDREW-T--LAMAS", "name": "ANDREW T.
