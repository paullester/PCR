{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2913"}, "description": "This seminar will examine the interseciton of religious belief and thought; racial structures, struggles and identities; and critical and cultural theories. We will take up questions of how religion impacts racial identity, how ethnic and religious identity interacts with, and inspires, political struggle; how critical and cultural theory is used to interrogate religious belief, and how social struggle and philosophical and religious reflection is informed by religious thought and critical and cultural theory. We will read, among others, Foucault, Hall, Derrida, Said, Asad, West, Dyson, Hart and Anderson. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "RACE, RELIG/CRIT THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7088/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "RACE, RELIG/CRIT THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-518-401", "path": "/courses/7088/sections/401", "id": "7088-401", "aliases": ["RELS-518-401", "AFAM-519-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/7088/sections/401/reviews/1952-MICHAEL-ERIC-DYSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1952-MICHAEL-ERIC-DYSON", "first_name": "MICHAEL ERIC", "last_name": "DYSON", "id": "1952-MICHAEL-ERIC-DYSON", "name": "MICHAEL ERIC DYSON"}, "num_reviewers": 1, "id": "7088-401-1952-MICHAEL-ERIC-DYSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-518", "path": "/courses/7088", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7088/sections", "values": [{"name": "RACE, RELIG/CRIT THEORY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-518-401", "path": "/courses/7088/sections/401", "id": "7088-401", "aliases": ["RELS-518-401", "AFAM-519-401"]}]}, "id": 7088, "aliases": ["RELS-518", "AFAM-519"]}
