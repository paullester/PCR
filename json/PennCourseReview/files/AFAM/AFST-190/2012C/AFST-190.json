{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1602"}, "description": "During the semester we will focus on people and communities of sub-Saharan Africa and on the ways people represent, reflect on, and react to various aspects and issues in their lives and the institutions which dominate their communities. We will focus particularly on the history, contemporary expression, and inter-relationships among politics, religion, and aesthetic practice. Members of Penn's African Studies community will share their expertise with the class and introduce the University's Africa resources. Texts consist of weekly readings, films, and recordings; and class members will be expected to attend several lectures outside of class. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28487/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.95", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.19", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFST-190-401", "path": "/courses/28487/sections/401", "id": "28487-401", "aliases": ["AFST-190-401", "AFRC-190-401", "ANTH-190-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/28487/sections/401/reviews/5127-MARY-JENNIFER-HASTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5127-MARY-JENNIFER-HASTY", "first_name": "MARY JENNIFER", "last_name": "HASTY", "id": "5127-MARY-JENNIFER-HASTY", "name": "MARY JENNIFER HASTY"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "28487-401-5127-MARY-JENNIFER-HASTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFST-190", "path": "/courses/28487", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28487/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFST-190-401", "path": "/courses/28487/sections/401", "id": "28487-401", "aliases": ["AFST-190-401", "AFRC-190-401", "ANTH-190-401"]}]}, "id": 28487, "aliases": ["AFST-190", "AFRC-190", "ANTH-190"]}
