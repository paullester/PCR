We will focus particularly on the history, contemporary expression, and inter-relationships among politics, religion, and aesthetic practice. Members of Penn's African Studies community will share their expertise with the class and introduce the University's Africa resources. Texts consist of weekly readings, films, and recordings; and class members will be expected to attend several lectures outside of class. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8468/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.66", "rWorkRequired": "3.23", "rInstructorAccess": "2.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.23", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFST-190-401", "path": "/courses/8468/sections/401", "id": "8468-401", "aliases": ["AFST-190-401", "HIST-190-401", "AFRC-190-401", "ANTH-190-401"]}, "comments": "In general, Professor Barnes\u2019 students enjoyed the course material, but many of them felt the reading assignments far too extensive.
