{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/617"}, "description": "This seminar will examine the experiences of recent emigrants and refugees from Africa, including many now living in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding region. In addition to reading some of the historical and comparative literature on migration, ethnic diasporas, and transnationalism, students will have the opportunity to conduct research on specific African communities in Philadelphia or elsewhere in North America, Europe, or the Middle East. African emigres' relations with both their home and host societies will be explored and compared with the experience of other immigrant groups over the past century. Topics include reasons for leaving Africa, patterns of economic and educational adaptation abroad, changes in gender and generational roles, issues of cultural and political identity, and the impact of national immigration policies. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "AFRICANS ABROAD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14666/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-489", "path": "/courses/14666", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14666/sections", "values": [{"name": "AFRICANS ABROAD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-489-401", "path": "/courses/14666/sections/401", "id": "14666-401", "aliases": ["HIST-489-401", "AFST-489-401"]}]}, "id": 14666, "aliases": ["HIST-489", "AFST-489"]}
