Readings included research reports, statutes and cases.\r\n\r\nStudents had very mixed opinions on this course. Some described it as \u201cenjoyable\u201d with \u201cdynamic discussion\u201d whereby they \u201clearned quite a bit.\u201d The other half of the reviewers had negative responses, with the consensus being, \u201cnot enough class participation \u2014 just [the] professor talking at the students about his opinions.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral students had strong negative reactions to Professor Fetni. More than one complained of his strong \u201cliberal bias\u201d and another described him as \u201crude and condescending.\u201d Students mostly seemed to agree that much of Fetni\u2019s lecturing was simply him delivering his own political views. Still, some students did like the professor, praising his enthusiasm and describing him as \u201ceasygoing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe workload for the course seemed acceptable, as there was reportedly a \u201cmanageable amount of reading.\u201d However, a student did complain about the specificity of the exam questions, claiming one would need a \u201cphotographic memory\u201d to answer some of them. Fetni also apparently included material on his exams not found in the book. This class is open to all classes and has no prerequisites. *This review is based on the 7 student comments that were submitted.
