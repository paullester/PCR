{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2879"}, "description": "This survey course considers Latin American musics within a broad cultural and historical framework. Latin American musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics, ritual, communication, religion, and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Latin American contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism, migration, ethnicity, and globalization. Throughout the course, we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music and then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relation to our own, North American contexts of music consumption and production. (Formerly Music 158). \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "CARIBBEAN MUS & DIASPORA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20541/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "CARIBBEAN MUS & DIASPORA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-258-401", "path": "/courses/20541/sections/401", "id": "20541-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-258-401", "FOLK-259-401", "AFRC-258-401", "LALS-258-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/20541/sections/401/reviews/1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "first_name": "TIMOTHY", "last_name": "ROMMEN", "id": "1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "name": "TIMOTHY ROMMEN"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "20541-401-1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-258", "path": "/courses/20541", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20541/sections", "values": [{"name": "CARIBBEAN MUS & DIASPORA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-258-401", "path": "/courses/20541/sections/401", "id": "20541-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-258-401", "FOLK-259-401", "AFRC-258-401", "LALS-258-401"]}]}, "id": 20541, "aliases": ["MUSC-258", "FOLK-259", "AFRC-258", "LALS-258"]}
