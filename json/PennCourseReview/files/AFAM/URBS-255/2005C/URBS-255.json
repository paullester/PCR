{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2434"}, "description": "The last several decades have witnessed a dramatic acceleration in the interconnection of cities around the world. The globalization of the economy, the spread of communications technology, major migrations between urban locations, increasing disparities between rich and poor, the dramatic growth of the \"culture industries\", and the increasingly popular quest for \"place making\" through urban design have all contributed to this process. This course will examine urban neighborhoods in the United States and elsewhere in the world. In particular, class readings and discussions will explore the wide range of ways (political, social, cultural; organized and informal) that individuals and institutions in urban neighborhoods have reacted to global transformations and what effects and consequences those reactions have precipitated. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12508/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.35", "rRecommendMajor": "3.35", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.65", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-255-401", "path": "/courses/12508/sections/401", "id": "12508-401", "aliases": ["URBS-255-401", "HIST-255-401", "AFRC-255-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/12508/sections/401/reviews/2047-ELIZABETH-L-GREENSPAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2047-ELIZABETH-L-GREENSPAN", "first_name": "ELIZABETH L", "last_name": "GREENSPAN", "id": "2047-ELIZABETH-L-GREENSPAN", "name": "ELIZABETH L GREENSPAN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "12508-401-2047-ELIZABETH-L-GREENSPAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-255", "path": "/courses/12508", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12508/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-255-401", "path": "/courses/12508/sections/401", "id": "12508-401", "aliases": ["URBS-255-401", "HIST-255-401", "AFRC-255-401"]}]}, "id": 12508, "aliases": ["URBS-255", "HIST-255", "AFRC-255"]}
