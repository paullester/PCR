{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2174"}, "description": "Immigration is among the most important yet controversial forces shaping cities, regions, and neighborhoods. The diversity of immigrant and receiving communities means that the dynamics and impacts of migration are varied and complex. This course examines the development of immigrant and receiving communities in the US. It surveys public policy and community and economic development practices related to migration at the local, regional, national, and trans-national scale. Class readings, discussions, and visits to Philadelphia's immigrant neighborhoods explore themes including labor markets, housing experiences, local and state policy, civil society, and the built environment. \n\nThe first half of the course surveys migration and community formation among a broad range of ethnic groups in different parts of the city and suburbs, mainly through history, sociology, and geography; the second half focuses on specific policy and community and economic development initiatives. The class aims to provide students with 1) a broad knowledge of immigration and its impacts on cities and regions; 2) an in-depth understanding of urban policies and institutions working on immigration in U.S. cities; and 3) familiarity with community and economic development strategies for migrant and receiving communities. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ETHNICITY: THE IMMIGRANT CITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16553/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "3.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "ETHNICITY: THE IMMIGRANT CITY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-270-401", "path": "/courses/16553/sections/401", "id": "16553-401", "aliases": ["URBS-270-401", "CPLN-670-401", "SOCI-270-401", "URBS-670-401", "AFRC-272-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/16553/sections/401/reviews/2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "first_name": "DOMENIC", "last_name": "VITIELLO", "id": "2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO", "name": "DOMENIC VITIELLO"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "16553-401-2719-DOMENIC-VITIELLO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-270", "path": "/courses/16553", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16553/sections", "values": [{"name": "ETHNICITY: THE IMMIGRANT CITY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-270-401", "path": "/courses/16553/sections/401", "id": "16553-401", "aliases": ["URBS-270-401", "CPLN-670-401", "SOCI-270-401", "URBS-670-401", "AFRC-272-401"]}]}, "id": 16553, "aliases": ["URBS-270", "CPLN-670", "SOCI-270", "URBS-670", "AFRC-272"]}
