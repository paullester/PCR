What's at stake in these debates? What does immigration mean for cities and regions? And what roles should policy makers, planners, and community organizations play in shaping migration and its impacts? This course examines these questions in the context of immigrant, refugee, and receiving communities in the United States. It surveys public policy and community and economic development practices related to migration, at the local, regional, and trans-national scale. Class readings, discussions, and regular visits to a variety of Philadelphia's immigrant neighborhoods explore themes including labor markets, political mobilization, social and cultural policy, and the built environment.\r\nThe first half of the course surveys migration and community development among a broad range of ethnic groups in different parts of the city and suburbs while the second half focuses on specific policy and development initiatives. Assignments include an opportunity to work with immigrant-serving organizations.\r\nStudents raved about this class.
