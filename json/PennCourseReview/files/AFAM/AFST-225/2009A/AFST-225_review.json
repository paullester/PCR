Some remarked that she was a \u201cfun professor who really enjoys teaching.\u201d Other students said that \u201cProfessor Mbeje is clearly very passionate about the topic and tries to get us interested in it.\u201d However, some others thought that the pace Professor Mbeje set for the class was too slow, complaining that she would spend \u201ctwo or more classes on a presentation that was nine slides long.\u201d Others said that she didn\u2019t express the information clearly enough and the students often had trouble understanding it.\r\n\r\nStudents complained that the final project, which was a presentation and final essay, was changed at the last minute from a 12-page paper with a group of 6 to a 15-page paper with a group of 3. Others complained about the pop quizzes that were sprung on the class to make sure people were showing up for the lectures. Still some other students noted that \u201cthere was not much work throughout the course of the semester, and the readings were usually interesting.\u201d", "num_students": 110, "path": "/courses/15291/sections/401/reviews/1223-AUDREY-N--MBEJE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1223-AUDREY-N--MBEJE", "first_name": "AUDREY N.", "last_name": "MBEJE", "id": "1223-AUDREY-N--MBEJE", "name": "AUDREY N.
