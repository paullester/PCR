{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1159"}, "description": "The aim of the course is to provide a general perspective on African languages and African linguistics. No background in linguistics is necessary. Students will be introduced to theoretical linguistics-its concepts, theories, ways of argumentation, data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation. The focus will be on the languages and linguistics of Africa to provide you with the knowledge and skills required to handle the language and language-related issues typical of African conditions. We will cover topics related to formal linguistics (phonology/phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics), aspects of pragmatics as well as the general socio-linguistic character of African countries. We will also cover language in context, language and culture, borrowing, multilingualism, and cross-cultural communication in Africa. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "AFRICAN LANG. & CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21231/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.67", "rDifficulty": "1.56", "rStimulateInterest": "1.84", "rRecommendMajor": "2.59", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "1.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.59", "rReadingsValue": "1.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.52", "rCommAbility": "2.14", "rInstructorQuality": "2.45"}, "section": {"name": "AFRICAN LANG. & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFST-225-401", "path": "/courses/21231/sections/401", "id": "21231-401", "aliases": ["AFST-225-401", "AFRC-225-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 85, "path": "/courses/21231/sections/401/reviews/1223-AUDREY-N--MBEJE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1223-AUDREY-N--MBEJE", "first_name": "AUDREY N.", "last_name": "MBEJE", "id": "1223-AUDREY-N--MBEJE", "name": "AUDREY N.
