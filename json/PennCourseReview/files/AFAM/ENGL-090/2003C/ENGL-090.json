{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/391"}, "description": "This course will focus on questions of gender difference and of sexual desire in a range of literary works, paying special attention to works by women and treatments of same-sex desire. More fundamentally, the course will introduce students to questions about the relation between identity and representation. We will attend in particular to intersections between gender, sexuality, race, class, and nation, and will choose from a rich vein of authors: Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, the Brontes, Christina Rossetti, George Eliot, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Gertrude Stein, Zora Neale Hurston, E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Nella Larsen, Radclyffe Hall, Willa Cather, Elizabeth Bishop, Jean Rhys, James Baldwin, Sylvia Plath, Bessie Head, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Cherr?e Moraga, Toni Morrison, Michael Cunningham, Dorothy Allison, Jeanette Winterson, and Leslie Feinberg. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "WOMEN & LIT: Women, Sex, and Power:  Literature and the Rise of Feminism", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4038/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.62", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.92", "rReadingsValue": "3.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.23", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN & LIT: Women, Sex, and Power:  Literature and the Rise of Feminism", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-090-401", "path": "/courses/4038/sections/401", "id": "4038-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-090-401", "WSTD-090-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/4038/sections/401/reviews/389-ASELDA-J-THOMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/389-ASELDA-J-THOMPSON", "first_name": "ASELDA J", "last_name": "THOMPSON", "id": "389-ASELDA-J-THOMPSON", "name": "ASELDA J THOMPSON"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "4038-401-389-ASELDA-J-THOMPSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-090", "path": "/courses/4038", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4038/sections", "values": [{"name": "WOMEN & LIT: Women, Sex, and Power:  Literature and the Rise of Feminism", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-090-401", "path": "/courses/4038/sections/401", "id": "4038-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-090-401", "WSTD-090-401"]}]}, "id": 4038, "aliases": ["ENGL-090", "WSTD-090"]}
