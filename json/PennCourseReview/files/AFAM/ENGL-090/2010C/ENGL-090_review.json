It considers the diverse ways these women addressed issues of national and gender identity. It examines how women negotiated between the two, particularly during periods in which women were legally excluded from certain kinds of participation in the national and political spheres due to their gender and/or race. Though the class has a longer historical sweep, it focuses primarily on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and includes poetry, novels, short stories, and some selected journalism and critical texts. Class requirements include three short (2-3 pages) essays, a final 5-7 page essay, and a final exam.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents had a \u201cmutual respect and interest for what is being taught.\u201d Overall, they agreed that the class was \u201cfantastic.\u201d Students found the course and texts unique and interesting.
