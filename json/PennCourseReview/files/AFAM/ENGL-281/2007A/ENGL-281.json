The course will present an assortment of emphases, some of them focused on geography (for example, the Harlem Renaissance), others focused on genre (autobiography, poetry or drama), the politics of gender and class, or a particular grouping of authors. Previous versions of this course have included \"African American Autobiography,\" \"Backgrounds of African American Literature,\" \"The Black Narrative\" (beginning with eighteenth century slave narratives and working toward contemporary literature), as well as seminars on urban spaces, jazz, migration, oral narratives, black Christianity, and African-American music. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "TPCS AFRICAN-AMER LIT: SLAVERY AND NARRATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14408/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "TPCS AFRICAN-AMER LIT: SLAVERY AND NARRATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ENGL-281-401", "path": "/courses/14408/sections/401", "id": "14408-401", "aliases": ["ENGL-281-401", "AFRC-281-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/14408/sections/401/reviews/2943-GABRIEL-A--CERVANTES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2943-GABRIEL-A--CERVANTES", "first_name": "GABRIEL A.", "last_name": "CERVANTES", "id": "2943-GABRIEL-A--CERVANTES", "name": "GABRIEL A.
