We will consider musicians as wide-ranging as Sarah Vaughn, Nina Simone, Esperanza Spalding, and the all-woman jazz bands of the 1940s to artistic interpretations of the jazz singer in Ann Petry\u2019s novel The Street (1947) and Amiri Baraka\u2019s Billie Holiday poems, and the films, Stormy Weather (1943) and Cadillac Blues (2008). \u00a0By blending literary analysis with the history of jazz studies, our course will emphasize how women uniquely shaped the production, reception, and criticism of jazz culture.\r\n\r\nStudents had universally excellent reviews of this course.  Several students described it as among their \u201cfavorite courses taken at Penn.\u201d  The course matter was considered \u201cfascinating\u201d and \u201crefreshing.\u201d  Participants found the co-taught lectures informative, and the work outside the classroom \u201cstimulating.\u201d  One student noted, \u201cit is one of those classes that changes the way you look at the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course was co-taught by Professor Tillet and Professor Ramsey.  Students appreciated their \u201cunique collaboration.\u201d  Class members found the lecturers \u201cquite knowledgeable\u201d and \u201ceffective teachers.\u201d  Moreover, the pair was praised for being approachable and helpful to students on \u201can individual level.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs this course has a variety of cross-listings, a diversity of majors were represented in the course.  Students evidently found the assignments and workload manageable, seeing as there were no complaints about either whatsoever.
