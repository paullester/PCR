It analyzes the stylistic flux of jazz, such as the progression from dance music to bebop and the emergence of the avant-garde and jazz-rock. Attention is given to both the artists who generated the changes and the cultural and social conditions that often provided the impetus.\r\n\r\nStudents who have taken the course have reported that it was \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cstimulated interest regardless of the students\u2019 musical background.\u201d The subject matter was described as \u201cfascinating,\u201d and students voiced their excitement over the musical performances throughout the semester, which they said set this class apart from other music history courses.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsey \u201cwent above and beyond\u201d to engage his students and make the material understandable. Several students did note, however, that he was at times very self-promoting, requiring students to attend his performances and those of his friends. Overall, the opinion of Professor Ramsey was positive and students really appreciated his ability to demonstrate relevant musical terms by playing examples during the lecture. \r\n\r\nThe course has a small workload, consisting mostly of \u201cinteresting readings,\u201d and the exams were reported by most to be fairly easy. Students who have taken the course recommend it to \u201cany student with even the slightest interest in jazz.\u201d \r\n", "num_students": 96, "path": "/courses/17767/sections/401/reviews/1900-GUTHRIE-P--RAMSEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1900-GUTHRIE-P--RAMSEY", "first_name": "GUTHRIE P.", "last_name": "RAMSEY", "id": "1900-GUTHRIE-P--RAMSEY", "name": "GUTHRIE P.
