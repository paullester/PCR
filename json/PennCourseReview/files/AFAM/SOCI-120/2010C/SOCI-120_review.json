The course familiarizes students with how to describe groups and generalize relationships between groups using statistics. Students learn how to calculate statistical relationships by hand and with the help of computer programs.\r\n\r\nMost students felt that the course material did not meet their expectations. Some students were concerned that the class relied too heavily on the \u201csystem for running statistical data (SPSS) instead of [teaching] how to do everything.\u201d Other students were disappointed that \u201cthere is no concrete application of the material, so it's really hard to learn it.\u201d Several students noted that their TA provided the most valuable resource for course materials, rather than using assigned readings or lecture notes.\r\n\r\nMany students criticized Professor Koppel\u2019s lectures. Regarding Professor Koppel\u2019s description of course content, one student noted how \u201chis form of explaining things often ended up confusing me more than helping me.\u201d Other students noted that Professor Koppel seemed \u201call over the place in lectures\u201d and had difficulty communicating the concepts in \u201ca non-math, non-statistics oriented class.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course caters mainly to students with some background in sociology. Students commented that lectures, readings, and assignments seemed disjointed, but the course could prove \u201cvery easy\u201d with help from the TAs.\r\n", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/23789/sections/401/reviews/659-ROSS-KOPPEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/659-ROSS-KOPPEL", "first_name": "ROSS", "last_name": "KOPPEL", "id": "659-ROSS-KOPPEL", "name": "ROSS KOPPEL"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "23789-401-659-ROSS-KOPPEL"}]
