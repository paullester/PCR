Upon completion, you shoud be familiar with a variety of basic statistical techniques that allow examination of interesting social questions. We begin by learning to describe the characteristics of groups, followed by a discussion of how to examine and generalize about relationships between the characteristics of groups. Emphasis is placed on the understanding/interpretation of statistics used to describe and make generalizations about group characteristics. In addition to hand calculations, you will also become familiar with using PCs to run statistical tests. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "SOCIAL STATISTICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16459/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.16", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "0.81", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "1.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.48", "rInstructorAccess": "1.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.91", "rCommAbility": "1.13", "rInstructorQuality": "1.51"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIAL STATISTICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SOCI-120-001", "path": "/courses/16459/sections/001", "id": "16459-001", "aliases": ["SOCI-120-001"]}, "comments": "Social Statistics aims to provide a basic introduction to the application and interpretation of statistical analysis in sociology.

Students felt time in class was not well spent and what they were doing was not well explained, leaving them to figure out most of the material by themselves from their textbooks. They also agreed that class was boring. One student called lectures \u201cconsistently uninteresting and even bordering on useless.\u201d Inability to stimulate student interest was illustrated by another student\u2019s observation that the class was half empty for each lecture. &#8232;\r\n&#8232;Students found Professor Parrado difficult to understand and felt class material was rushed through. Their frustration was compounded by Professor Parrado\u2019s choice not to post lecture slides online, meaning they couldn\u2019t catch up or review material on their own. A few students noted they were left in the dark by the professor and TA, whom they felt were not very accessible or helpful: \u201cI was thrown into the subject matter and was forced to fend for myself\u2026rather than being taught the material.\u201d Another student, however, called Professor Parrado \u201creally nice and very approachable.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;\r\nMany students found the workload exacerbated by lack of coordination between lectures and recitation and not being taught what their homework covered. One student summarized, \u201cI found the class to be challenging, not because the material was difficult, but rather because of the lack of guidance.\u201d", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/16459/sections/001/reviews/4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO", "first_name": "EMILIO ALBERTO", "last_name": "PARRADO", "id": "4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO", "name": "EMILIO ALBERTO PARRADO"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "16459-001-4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-120", "path": "/courses/16459", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16459/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOCIAL STATISTICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SOCI-120-001", "path": "/courses/16459/sections/001", "id": "16459-001", "aliases": ["SOCI-120-001"]}]}, "id": 16459, "aliases": ["SOCI-120"]}
