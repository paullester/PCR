With some background reading in Cervantes and other precursors (such as Henry Fielding), the class looks at Dickens and Joyce as figures in a spectacular, even phantasmagoric, history of the urban novel that resists the more sober conventions of domestic or psychological realism. Students concentrate on Dickens's epic of 19th-century London, Our Mutual Friend, and Joyce's epic of 20th-century Dublin, Ulysses. Readings include a fairly substantial set of critical and historical essays chosen to elaborate the social contexts and interpretive possibilities associated with the two main novels. Written requirements include two essays and several short response papers.&#8232;&#8232;\r\nStudents really enjoyed the class and its material. The students especially emphasized the level of intellectual engagement in the class. One student wrote, \u201cevery single class, I come out of the classroom, brain literally hurting, filled with new thoughts and ideas.\u201d Other students also expressed their enjoyment of the intellectual level of the course.
