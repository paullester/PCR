Contemporary issues such as racial profiling, affirmative action, and diversity will all be covered in their social and legal context. The basis for discussion will be assigned texts, articles, editorials and cases. In addition, interactive videos will also be used to aid class discussion. Course requirements will include examinations and class discussions.\r\n\r\nStudents overall felt the class was \u201ceasy and understandable,\u201d with a fair amount of emphasis on the readings and valuable learning experience.\r\n\r\nMost students described Anderson as \u201cinteresting and hilarious,\u201d though some characterized the humor in the class to be \u201cdry\u201d at times. Some felt the lectures were \u201ca little too messy,\u201d but most found Anderson capable of conveying the subject matter and being able to meet outside of class.\r\n\r\nThis course requires some readings which are used in lectures. The course comes fairly recommended to both majors and non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/15991/sections/401/reviews/1883-JOSE-F--ANDERSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1883-JOSE-F--ANDERSON", "first_name": "JOSE F.", "last_name": "ANDERSON", "id": "1883-JOSE-F--ANDERSON", "name": "JOSE F.
