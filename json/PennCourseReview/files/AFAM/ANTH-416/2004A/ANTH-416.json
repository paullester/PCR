{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/139"}, "description": "ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class, gender, religion, ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking, highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it), one which demands careful attention to culture and biology, mythology and history, science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it, using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6164/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-416", "path": "/courses/6164", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6164/sections", "values": [{"name": "PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-416-401", "path": "/courses/6164/sections/401", "id": "6164-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-416-401", "WSTD-416-401", "AFAM-416-401"]}]}, "id": 6164, "aliases": ["ANTH-416", "WSTD-416", "AFAM-416"]}
