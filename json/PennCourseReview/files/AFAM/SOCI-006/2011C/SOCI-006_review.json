This course pays close attention to how social scientists have defined and measured racial inequality and progress in the last century. It considers how dramatic demographic shifts, the growing number of interracial families and individuals who identify as mixed-race, trans-racial adoptions, and the increased visibility of people of color in media, positions of influence, and as celebrities, inform scholarly and popular debates about racial progress. Along with some classic works, students will also read literature regarding the class versus race debate and color-blind racism. In the process, students will become familiar with sociological data often drawn from in debates about racial progress and will also develop analytical and critical thinking skills. \r\n\r\nOverall this course was very highly thought of.
