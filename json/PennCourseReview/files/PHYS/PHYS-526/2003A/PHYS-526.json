{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1447"}, "description": "This is a course on the theory of the interaction of light and matter designed primarily for graduate and advanced undergraduate students to build the basic tools required to do research in astrophysics. Topics to be discussed include structure of single- and multi-electron atoms, radiative and collisional processes, spectral line formation, opacity, radiation transfer, analytical and numerical methods, and a selection of applications in astrophysics based on student research interest. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ASTROPHYSICAL RADIATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2081/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "ASTROPHYSICAL RADIATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-526-001", "path": "/courses/2081/sections/001", "id": "2081-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-526-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/2081/sections/001/reviews/1931-RAUL-JIMENEZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1931-RAUL-JIMENEZ", "first_name": "RAUL", "last_name": "JIMENEZ", "id": "1931-RAUL-JIMENEZ", "name": "RAUL JIMENEZ"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "2081-001-1931-RAUL-JIMENEZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-526", "path": "/courses/2081", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2081/sections", "values": [{"name": "ASTROPHYSICAL RADIATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-526-001", "path": "/courses/2081/sections/001", "id": "2081-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-526-001"]}]}, "id": 2081, "aliases": ["PHYS-526"]}
