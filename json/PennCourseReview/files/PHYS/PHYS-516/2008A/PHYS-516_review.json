The course emphasizes a mathematical approach to topics such as optical manipulation, astrophysical phenomena, and the generalizations from Maxwell\u2019s theory to other fundamental interactions, such as strong, electroweak and gravitational forces. \r\n\r\nThis course was rated as very challenging. One student said it was a \u201cdifficult but valuable class.\u201d Students wished notes on the board were clearer due to the heavy focus on mathematics in lecture. \r\n\r\nMany students agreed that one of Professor\u2019s Nelsons strengths was his approach to teaching. His lectures would focus on the big picture and \u201cshow you how to think about the material like a true physicist.\u201d Others added that he is a \u201cbrilliant lecturer\u201d and that his \u201cteaching style is a nice change from other [professors].\u201d \r\n\r\nHowever, some students noted that the focus on math was too intense, and that lectures were very fast-paced, making it difficult to take notes. But Professor Nelson was more than willing to meet with students after class and was rated high on accessibility by students.", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/20704/sections/001/reviews/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "first_name": "PHILIP", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "name": "PHILIP NELSON"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "20704-001-1675-PHILIP-NELSON"}]
