{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/907"}, "description": "Survey of electrodynamics, focusing on applications to research done in the Department. Topics include mathematical structure and relativistic invariance properties of Maxwell equations, tensor methods, and the generation and scattering of radiation, in vacuum and in materials. Applications vary from year to year but include optical manipulation, astrophysical phenomena, and the generalizations from Maxwell's theory to those of other fundamental interactions (strong, electroweak, and gravitational forces). \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMEN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26636/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.77", "rDifficulty": "1.64", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.18", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "2.55", "rReadingsValue": "1.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.32", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09"}, "section": {"name": "ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMEN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-516-001", "path": "/courses/26636/sections/001", "id": "26636-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-516-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/26636/sections/001/reviews/3147-BURT-A--OVRUT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3147-BURT-A--OVRUT", "first_name": "BURT A.", "last_name": "OVRUT", "id": "3147-BURT-A--OVRUT", "name": "BURT A.
