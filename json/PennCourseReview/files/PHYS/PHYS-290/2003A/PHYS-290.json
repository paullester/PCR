{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1445"}, "description": "The goal of this class is to teach students to use computers as a tool in solving physics problems. The focus will be on actual hands on computational solutions rather than the computational of physical theory. You will be writing code and solving physics problems from the very beginning. By the end of the semester you should be able to solve a variety of physics/scientific problems. The techniques learned in this course will be useful for physics and other topics and should provide a useful foundation for your future career. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "PHYSINTHEINFORMATIONAGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2071/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "2.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.14", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSINTHEINFORMATIONAGE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-290-401", "path": "/courses/2071/sections/401", "id": "2071-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-290-401", "PHYS-509-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/2071/sections/401/reviews/1930-PAVLOS--PROTOPAPAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1930-PAVLOS--PROTOPAPAS", "first_name": "PAVLOS.", "last_name": "PROTOPAPAS", "id": "1930-PAVLOS--PROTOPAPAS", "name": "PAVLOS.
