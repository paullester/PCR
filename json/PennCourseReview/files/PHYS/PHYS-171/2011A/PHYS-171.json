One student wished the class had a TA and recitation.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gladney \u201cwas a good instructor who effectively taught the material.\u201d He was \u201cvery good at detailing the underlying physics and mathematical reasoning behind everything and ultimately uniting almost everything we did in a single model and theory.\u201d\r\n\r\nPHYS 171 is \u201can incredibly difficult and in-depth course,\u201d described by one student in one word: \u201cintense.\u201d One student wrote that the homework was very difficult, time consuming, and graded harshly. The course is recommended for well-prepared students in engineering and the physical sciences, and particularly for those planning to major in physics. It fulfills the Physical World Sector. Pre-requisites include Math 114 and PHYS 150 or 170 and co-requisite of Math 240. Note: Fewer than eight students reviewed this course.\r\n", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/22291/sections/301/reviews/975-LARRY-GLADNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/975-LARRY-GLADNEY", "first_name": "LARRY", "last_name": "GLADNEY", "id": "975-LARRY-GLADNEY", "name": "LARRY GLADNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "22291-301-975-LARRY-GLADNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-171", "path": "/courses/22291", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22291/sections", "values": [{"name": "HONORS PHYSICS II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHYS-171-301", "path": "/courses/22291/sections/301", "id": "22291-301", "aliases": ["PHYS-171-301"]}]}, "id": 22291, "aliases": ["PHYS-171"]}
