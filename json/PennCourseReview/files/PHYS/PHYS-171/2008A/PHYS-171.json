Prerequisites for this course include Math 114 and either Physics 150 or 170.  According to the course description, the course is recommended \u201cfor well-prepared students in engineering and the physical sciences, and particularly for those planning to major in physics.\u201d  It also fulfills the Physical World Sector requirement.\r\n\r\nThe course covers electric and magnetic fields; Coulomb\\'s, Ampere\\'s, and Faraday\\'s laws; special relativity; Maxwell\\'s equations, and electromagnetic radiation, according to the course description.  Students found the course to be extremely difficult; one wrote that it was the \u201cmost rigorous course this year, with the most amount of work required.\u201d  They especially thought the homework problem sets were extremely challenging and at times \u201coverwhelming.\u201d  Many students requested that, in the future, a TA be provided to assist them.\r\n\r\nDespite the difficult nature of the course, students described it as \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cworthwhile.\u201d  One student commented, \u201cDr. Mele is an excellent lecturer, although he sometimes can be a bit dry.\u201d Overall, they were pleased with Professor Mele\u2019s teaching style, and thought that he did a good job of presenting the material.
