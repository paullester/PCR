Topics include\r\nelectrostatics, static potential theory, multi-pole expansions, Laplace\u2019s equation, image\r\nsolutions, fields in polarized matter, and magneto-statics.\r\nStudents across the board greatly enjoyed the class calling it \u201cfulfilling\u201d and one\r\nof the best they have ever taken. Because of the depth and complexity of the material,\r\nmost students felt that they grew from the experience. One student remarked, \u201cI am\r\nsmarter and better at physics as a result of this course.\u201d\r\nProfessor Mele received superlative reviews from all of his students.
