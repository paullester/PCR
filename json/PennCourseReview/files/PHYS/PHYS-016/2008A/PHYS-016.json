{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3487"}, "description": "The developed world's dependence on fossil fuels for energy production has extremely undesirable economic, environmental, and political consequences, and is likely to be mankind's greatest challenge in the 21st century. We describe the physical principles of energy, its production and consumption, and environmental consequences, including the greenhouse effect. We will examine a number of alternative modes of energy generation - fossil fuels, biomass, wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear - and study the physical and technological aspects of each, and their societal, environmental and economic impacts over the construction and operational lifetimes. No previous study of physics is assumed. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "ENERGY,OIL&GLOBAL WARMIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20687/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.06", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "1.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.02", "rCourseQuality": "1.94", "rWorkRequired": "1.56", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "1.52", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.15", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "ENERGY,OIL&GLOBAL WARMIN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-016-001", "path": "/courses/20687/sections/001", "id": "20687-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-016-001"]}, "comments": "Physics 016 looks at energy production in the 21st century, considering the environmental consequences of global dependence on fossil fuels. Students are exposed to the physical principles of energy production and consumption, as well as the physics and technology behind alternative energy sources, including biomass, solar, hydro and nuclear power. The course may involve field trips to power plants.\r\n\r\nMany students said they enjoyed the class but felt it was highly disorganized. A few students thought the class was excellent and that the professor was an awesome lecturer. Many complained about the lack of syllabus in the class and thought that the two 10-page papers assigned in the last two weeks of school were \u201cnot fair.\u201d Some students also felt that grades were \u201carbitrarily assigned,\u201d and that there was \u201cvery little feedback\u201d on student performance even in the last weeks of the course. Assignments and grades were not returned until very late in the course.\r\n\r\nThis course is designed for students hailing from non-science backgrounds. No previous experience with physics or science is assumed. The class fulfills the Natural Science and Mathematics requirement in the College curriculum.", "num_students": 84, "path": "/courses/20687/sections/001/reviews/1672-KENNETH-LANDE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1672-KENNETH-LANDE", "first_name": "KENNETH", "last_name": "LANDE", "id": "1672-KENNETH-LANDE", "name": "KENNETH LANDE"}, "num_reviewers": 52, "id": "20687-001-1672-KENNETH-LANDE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-016", "path": "/courses/20687", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20687/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENERGY,OIL&GLOBAL WARMIN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-016-001", "path": "/courses/20687/sections/001", "id": "20687-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-016-001"]}]}, "id": 20687, "aliases": ["PHYS-016"]}
