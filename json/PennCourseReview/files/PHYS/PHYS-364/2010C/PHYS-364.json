{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2075"}, "description": "A laboratory-intensive survey of analog and digital electronics, intended to teach students of physics or related fields enough electronics to be comfortable learning additional topics on their own from a reference such as Horowitz and Hill. Specific topics will vary from year to year from the selection of topics listed below. Analog topics may include voltage dividers, impedance, filters, operational amplifier circuits, and transistor circuits. Digital topics may include logic gates, finite-state machines, programmable logic devices, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion, and microcomputer concepts. Recommended for students planning to do experimental work in physical science. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MEASUREMENTS LAB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23644/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.82", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "3.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.45", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.73", "rCommAbility": "2.09", "rInstructorQuality": "2.45"}, "section": {"name": "MEASUREMENTS LAB", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-364-401", "path": "/courses/23644/sections/401", "id": "23644-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-364-401", "PHYS-564-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/23644/sections/401/reviews/5511-WILLIAM-ASHMANSKAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5511-WILLIAM-ASHMANSKAS", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "ASHMANSKAS", "id": "5511-WILLIAM-ASHMANSKAS", "name": "WILLIAM ASHMANSKAS"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "23644-401-5511-WILLIAM-ASHMANSKAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-364", "path": "/courses/23644", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23644/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEASUREMENTS LAB", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PHYS-364-401", "path": "/courses/23644/sections/401", "id": "23644-401", "aliases": ["PHYS-364-401", "PHYS-564-401"]}]}, "id": 23644, "aliases": ["PHYS-364", "PHYS-564"]}
