Subjects include Lagrangian dynamics, central forces, non-inertial reference frames, and rigid bodies.\r\n\r\nStudents seemed to enjoy the class and described it as a good follow-up \u201cto fill in gaps from freshmen mechanics,\u201d though more difficult. Many appreciated the fact that the textbook was clear and easy to \u201cabsorb.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson received positive reviews from all of his students. Students described him as \u201cengaging and personable\u201d and willing to help during office hours. Some students felt that lectures were an exact repetition of what was covered in the textbook, which may have decreased incentive to attend class. \r\n\r\nThe course covers a great deal of material, and the majority of work stems from weekly homework problem sets, which were apparently inconsistent. These sets ranged from having 12+ to only three problems of equal difficulty. Though exam difficulty varied greatly, most felt that an in-depth understanding of problem sets was sufficient for preparation. \r\n*This review was based on less than 8 comments\r\n", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22294/sections/001/reviews/974--ALAN-T--JOHNSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/974--ALAN-T--JOHNSON", "first_name": ",ALAN T.", "last_name": "JOHNSON", "id": "974--ALAN-T--JOHNSON", "name": ",ALAN T.
