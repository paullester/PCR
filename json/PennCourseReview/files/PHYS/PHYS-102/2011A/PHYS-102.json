Because the class is not rigorously calculus-based, it is generally suggested for pre-medical or pre-health students.\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that the class was rewarding and offered an intuitive introduction to complex physical concepts. Because the course was designed for pre-health students, the class tested overall concepts as opposed to the rigorous math used in the course.\r\n\r\nStudents praised Professor Kikkawa as a \u201cfantastic\u201d instructor, and they valued his ability to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d complex E&M concepts into more intuitive forms. Most felt that he had \u201ceffective teaching methods\u201d and seemed to genuinely care about the class. A number of students called him the \u201cbest professor [they] have ever had at Penn.\u201d However, some wrote that the lecture, textbook, and homework problems did not fully prepare them for the quizzes and exams.\r\n\r\nThe course demands a great deal of work as weekly quizzes force students to keep up with the material. Grades depend on performance on: one midterm; weekly quizzes that add up to the point equivalent of a midterm; and a final exam. Because the class is mostly composed of pre-health students, the curve is highly competitive.\r\n", "num_students": 134, "path": "/courses/22286/sections/001/reviews/2305-JAY-KIKKAWA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2305-JAY-KIKKAWA", "first_name": "JAY", "last_name": "KIKKAWA", "id": "2305-JAY-KIKKAWA", "name": "JAY KIKKAWA"}, "num_reviewers": 115, "id": "22286-001-2305-JAY-KIKKAWA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.13", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.03", "rRecommendMajor": "1.97", "rCourseQuality": "1.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.95", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "1.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "1.66", "rInstructorQuality": "1.93"}, "section": {"name": "General Physics: Electromagnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PHYS-102-601", "path": "/courses/22286/sections/601", "id": "22286-601", "aliases": ["PHYS-102-601"]}, "comments": "General Physics: Electromagnetism, Optics, and Modern Physics is a continuation of PHYS 101 emphasizing an introduction to classical electricity and magnetism, relativity theory, optics, and the quantum theory of matter, requiring a background in calculus.

One student wrote that his teaching style \u201cimproves dramatically\u201d when he is genuinely interested in the subject matter, while another complained that he focuses too much on theoretical knowledge rather than applications. Some thought he did not relay the material effectively and that he just repeated the textbook.\r\n\r\nOne student wrote that the course was \u201cvery difficult, mainly because it was self taught.\u201d A prerequisite for this course is PHYS 101. Corequisites include PHYS 102 LAB. Credit is awarded for only one of the following courses: PHYS 102, PHYS 151, or PHYS 171. Students with AP or Transfer Credit for PHYS 92 or PHYS 94 who complete PHYS 102 will thereby surrender the AP or Transfer Credit. The course fulfills the Physical World Sector requirement.\r\n", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/22286/sections/601/reviews/5255-MATTHEW-C--MARTINO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5255-MATTHEW-C--MARTINO", "first_name": "MATTHEW C.", "last_name": "MARTINO", "id": "5255-MATTHEW-C--MARTINO", "name": "MATTHEW C.
