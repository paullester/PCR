This course is suggested for pre-health students and also fulfills the Physical World Sector requirement.\r\n\r\nIn Spring 2008, the course was taught 4 lectures a week by Professor Kikkawa and was taken with a co-requisite of the PHYS 120 lab.  Students raved about Professor Kikkawa\u2019s teaching style, which they found to be straightforward and on-topic.  As one student wrote, Professor Kikkawa \u201cis able to explain this difficult subject so that it is clear and understandable.\u201d  Several students commented on the professor\u2019s accessibility and willingness to talk to students outside of class.\r\n\r\nStudents were also pleased with the weekly quizzes, which they felt kept them on top of the material.
