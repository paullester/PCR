Many students, however, acknowledged that he taught with enthusiasm and truly cared about his students by making himself available during office hours. Some students liked how professor Allen brought in models and problems from readings in his lecture. One grad student even ranked professor Allen as one of best he had. Opinions were definitely strong on both sides.\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the physical world sector requirement.
