{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3580"}, "description": "This course forms the foundation for a \"physics-first\" approach to learning integrated science. The curriculum will promote active mental engagement of the learner, improvement and confidence in physical intuition, and provide applications of physics principles in real-world situations. Topics include multi-dimensional motion, Newton's Laws, concepts of energy conservation, thermodynamics, and wave motion. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "PHYSICS:THE FOUND OF SCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9851/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "3.35", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.41", "rCourseQuality": "3.35", "rWorkRequired": "3.59", "rInstructorAccess": "3.76", "rReadingsValue": "1.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS:THE FOUND OF SCI", "sectionnum": "931", "primary_alias": "PHYS-590-931", "path": "/courses/9851/sections/931", "id": "9851-931", "aliases": ["PHYS-590-931"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/9851/sections/931/reviews/975-LARRY-GLADNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/975-LARRY-GLADNEY", "first_name": "LARRY", "last_name": "GLADNEY", "id": "975-LARRY-GLADNEY", "name": "LARRY GLADNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "9851-931-975-LARRY-GLADNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-590", "path": "/courses/9851", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9851/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS:THE FOUND OF SCI", "sectionnum": "931", "primary_alias": "PHYS-590-931", "path": "/courses/9851/sections/931", "id": "9851-931", "aliases": ["PHYS-590-931"]}]}, "id": 9851, "aliases": ["PHYS-590"]}
