{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2079"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "GENERAL RELA.& COSMOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22298/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.08", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.58", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "GENERAL RELA.& COSMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/22298/sections/001", "id": "22298-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/22298/sections/001/reviews/4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "first_name": "MARK", "last_name": "TRODDEN", "id": "4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "name": "MARK TRODDEN"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "22298-001-4960-MARK-TRODDEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-503", "path": "/courses/22298", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22298/sections", "values": [{"name": "GENERAL RELA.& COSMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/22298/sections/001", "id": "22298-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}]}, "id": 22298, "aliases": ["PHYS-503"]}
