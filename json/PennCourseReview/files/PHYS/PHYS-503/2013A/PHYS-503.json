{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2079"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding the mathematical background, the construction of the theory, and applications to the solar system, black holes, gravitational waves and cosmology. The latter part of the course will cover some of the basic modern topics in modern cosmology, including the current cosmological model, the accelerating universe, and open questions driving current research. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "GENERAL RELATIVITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30882/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.50", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80", "rCommAbility": "3.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "GENERAL RELATIVITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/30882/sections/001", "id": "30882-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/30882/sections/001/reviews/4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "first_name": "MARK", "last_name": "TRODDEN", "id": "4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "name": "MARK TRODDEN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "30882-001-4960-MARK-TRODDEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-503", "path": "/courses/30882", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30882/sections", "values": [{"name": "GENERAL RELATIVITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/30882/sections/001", "id": "30882-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}]}, "id": 30882, "aliases": ["PHYS-503"]}
