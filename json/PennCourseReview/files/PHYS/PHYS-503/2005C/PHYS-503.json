{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2079"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "GEOMETRY/RELATIVITY/GRAV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12303/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.20", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "GEOMETRY/RELATIVITY/GRAV", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/12303/sections/001", "id": "12303-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/12303/sections/001/reviews/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "first_name": "PHILIP", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "name": "PHILIP NELSON"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "12303-001-1675-PHILIP-NELSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-503", "path": "/courses/12303", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12303/sections", "values": [{"name": "GEOMETRY/RELATIVITY/GRAV", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/12303/sections/001", "id": "12303-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}]}, "id": 12303, "aliases": ["PHYS-503"]}
