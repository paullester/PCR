{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2079"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "GEOMETRY/RELATIVITY/GRAV: General Relativity and Cosmology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19174/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "GEOMETRY/RELATIVITY/GRAV: General Relativity and Cosmology", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/19174/sections/001", "id": "19174-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/19174/sections/001/reviews/5073-JACEK-GUZIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5073-JACEK-GUZIK", "first_name": "JACEK", "last_name": "GUZIK", "id": "5073-JACEK-GUZIK", "name": "JACEK GUZIK"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "19174-001-5073-JACEK-GUZIK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-503", "path": "/courses/19174", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19174/sections", "values": [{"name": "GEOMETRY/RELATIVITY/GRAV: General Relativity and Cosmology", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/19174/sections/001", "id": "19174-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}]}, "id": 19174, "aliases": ["PHYS-503"]}
