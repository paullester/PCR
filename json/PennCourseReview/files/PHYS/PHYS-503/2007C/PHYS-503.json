{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2079"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "GEN. RELA.
