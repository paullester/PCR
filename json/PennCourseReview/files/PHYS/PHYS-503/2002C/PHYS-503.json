{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2079"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "GEN RELATIVITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3388/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "3.82", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "3.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.64", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "GEN RELATIVITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/3388/sections/001", "id": "3388-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/3388/sections/001/reviews/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "first_name": "PHILIP", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "1675-PHILIP-NELSON", "name": "PHILIP NELSON"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "3388-001-1675-PHILIP-NELSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-503", "path": "/courses/3388", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3388/sections", "values": [{"name": "GEN RELATIVITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-503-001", "path": "/courses/3388/sections/001", "id": "3388-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-503-001"]}]}, "id": 3388, "aliases": ["PHYS-503"]}
