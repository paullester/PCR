{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3215"}, "description": "This course will provide an introduction to current research performed by faculty in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. It will be particularly appropriate for sophomore or junior physics majors interested in participating in physics research; it will also be of interest to other science- or engineering-oriented students who want to learn more about current topics in physics. Grading will be based on attendance at seminars presented by faculty, homework assignments, and a term paper. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "INTRO PHYS/ASTR RESEARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8224/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO PHYS/ASTR RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHYS-295-301", "path": "/courses/8224/sections/301", "id": "8224-301", "aliases": ["PHYS-295-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/8224/sections/301/reviews/272-PAUL-A-HEINEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/272-PAUL-A-HEINEY", "first_name": "PAUL A", "last_name": "HEINEY", "id": "272-PAUL-A-HEINEY", "name": "PAUL A HEINEY"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "8224-301-272-PAUL-A-HEINEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-295", "path": "/courses/8224", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8224/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO PHYS/ASTR RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHYS-295-301", "path": "/courses/8224/sections/301", "id": "8224-301", "aliases": ["PHYS-295-301"]}]}, "id": 8224, "aliases": ["PHYS-295"]}
