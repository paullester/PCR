A smaller number felt they could not follow the concepts very well.\r\n\r\nStudents said Professor Cvetic was one of the best physics teachers. She was enthusiastic, really cared about the students, and was always willing to help. She made an effort to know students even though it was a large lecture class. Her lectures were engaging and informative. One student did note that her accent made understanding her difficult at times.\r\n\r\nStudents found the weekly quizzes to be a pain but acknowledged they helped them understand material.
