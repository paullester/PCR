Though some found the information to be interesting, many were taking the course just to fulfill a requirement. The material was considered difficult and the lectures unhelpful.\r\n\r\n\tProfessor Reese was generally regarded by the students as inexperienced and ineffective at teaching a big lecture. This was widely attributed to Professor Reese being a new postdoc teaching a big lecture for the first time. Professor Reese was described by several students as \u201ca good guy\u201d and \u201cvery friendly,\u201d as well as possessing an obvious command of the subject matter. Students said that Professor Reese taught verbatim from the book and often lacked confidence in his teaching, though this improved somewhat over time. Several students remarked on Professor Reese\u2019s trouble communicating the ideas to the class.

Students said that they were expected to \u201chave a high understanding of E&M\u201d and found it difficult to compete with those who had previously taken similar classes. The pace of topics covered was found to be challenging, with a pace of about one chapter per week.
