Nonetheless, students\r\nreported learning a lot and found the physics labs to be meaningful.\r\nStudents unanimously loved Professor Johnson, consistently describing him as\r\n\u201camazing,\u201d \u201cphenomenal,\u201d and the \u201cbest professor\u201d they have ever had. Students could\r\nnot say enough good about him in every area of teaching, including his \u201cengaging\u201d and\r\nfunny lecture style, availability to students for extra help, fair grading, clear and concise\r\ncommunication of the material, and assignment of relevant homework. Students noted\r\nthat he \u201creally cares about his students;\u201d he wants them to understand and succeed; and\r\nhe is \u201copen to questions and fun.\u201d He had a great ability to interact with his students on a\r\npersonal level and regularly asked for feedback on his course. Several students also\r\nnoted that he \u201cmake[s] physics relevant\u201d and \u201cclarif[ies] concepts by conveying intuition\r\nrather than implying them from math equations.\u201d He uses multimedia, demonstrations,\r\nand actively encourages participation during lectures. Professor Johnson posts his class\r\nnotes online, which was an \u201cexcellent study aid.\u201d\r\nThis course fulfills the Physical World Sector Requirement. Prerequisites for this\r\ncourse are PHYS 150 or PHYS 170, and corequisites are MATH 114 and PHYS 151\r\nLAB. Exams were described as \u201cchallenging yet fair,\u201d and students felt well prepared for\r\nthem. Weekly quizzes were also given, and students found that this helped them \u201cstay on\r\ntop of the work.\u201d Students recommended this course to anyone considering taking\r\nintroductory physics, whether they be a physics major or a non-major taking this course\r\nfor a pre-health requirement.", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/24978/sections/001/reviews/5510-ROBERT-R-JOHNSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5510-ROBERT-R-JOHNSON", "first_name": "ROBERT R", "last_name": "JOHNSON", "id": "5510-ROBERT-R-JOHNSON", "name": "ROBERT R JOHNSON"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "24978-001-5510-ROBERT-R-JOHNSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-151", "path": "/courses/24978", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24978/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRINCIPLES II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-151-001", "path": "/courses/24978/sections/001", "id": "24978-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-151-001"]}]}, "id": 24978, "aliases": ["PHYS-151"]}
