This course requires a stronger background in calculus that its predecessor. Grades are based mainly on quizzes, midterms, and a final exam. Weekly problem sets are highly recommended but not submitted for a grade.\r\n\r\nStudents thought the professor was knowledgeable but \u201cnot clear in communicating subject matter.\u201d Many said he lectured too quickly during class. Students described the quality of lectures to be very poor due to brevity and pacing. Several students said they would have liked more explanation in class as to theory and derivation of formulae. Many suggested that it was pointless to attend the lectures and that most help came from doing the homework problems.\r\n\r\nDespite numerous negative comments, some thought that the professor was \u201cgood.\u201d Many said he was willing to meet with students and explain concepts in more detail outside the classroom. Students also found him to be \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cgenuine.\\\"", "num_students": 77, "path": "/courses/20693/sections/003/reviews/968-H-TERRY-FORTUNE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/968-H-TERRY-FORTUNE", "first_name": "H TERRY", "last_name": "FORTUNE", "id": "968-H-TERRY-FORTUNE", "name": "H TERRY FORTUNE"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "20693-003-968-H-TERRY-FORTUNE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "3.08", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.12", "rCourseQuality": "2.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.42", "rCommAbility": "2.58", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES II", "sectionnum": "004", "primary_alias": "PHYS-151-004", "path": "/courses/20693/sections/004", "id": "20693-004", "aliases": ["PHYS-151-004"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/20693/sections/004/reviews/1674-ROBERT-JOHN-HOLLEBEEK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1674-ROBERT-JOHN-HOLLEBEEK", "first_name": "ROBERT JOHN", "last_name": "HOLLEBEEK", "id": "1674-ROBERT-JOHN-HOLLEBEEK", "name": "ROBERT JOHN HOLLEBEEK"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "20693-004-1674-ROBERT-JOHN-HOLLEBEEK"}]
