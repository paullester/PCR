The class is focused on\r\nincreasing your general knowledge of all things physics and architecture.\r\nProfessor Ashmanskas was described as one of the hardest working professors\r\nstudents have ever met at Penn. Every week he held study sessions on the material\r\ncovered that week and assisted the students in doing homework problems. His\r\naccessibility and willingness to help his students went well beyond what was expected of\r\nan instructor. His experiments were also very entertaining and a great way to see the\r\nmaterial in application.\r\nThis course fulfills the Physical World Sector requirement.
