It explores magnetic fields and potentials, electromagnetic induction, Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, and radiation.\r\n\r\nThe course was described as very difficult and challenging, though one commented that it was \u201cexcellent\u201d and another said it was his \u201cfavorite physics course to date.\u201d One student remarked that there was a greater focus on Electromagnetism rather than Electrodynamics.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mele was described as very knowledgeable and approachable. Students described him as \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cone of the best teachers\u201d they\u2019ve had. The main complaint was that his lectures were too quick and hard to follow. However, his lectures were available to students since they were recorded. Regardless, students felt that most of the exam came from the textbook rather than lectures and homework. \r\n\r\nOne student wrote that the difficulties of the exams were quite variable, though they were still fair. Many thought it was a challenging course requiring \u201ca lot of effort.\u201d A prerequisite for this course is PHYS 361.\r\n", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/22295/sections/401/reviews/982-EUGENE-J-MELE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/982-EUGENE-J-MELE", "first_name": "EUGENE J", "last_name": "MELE", "id": "982-EUGENE-J-MELE", "name": "EUGENE J MELE"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "22295-401-982-EUGENE-J-MELE"}]
