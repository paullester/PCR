Prerequisites are entrance credits in algebra and trigonometry, as well as a background in calculus. It must be taken with the Phys-101 lab. This course is a prerequisite for Physics 102, and is suggested for pre-health students.\r\n\r\nThe course generally covers kinematics, Newton\u2019s laws of motion, momentum, rotational motion, fluids, vibrations, and sound. Students didn\u2019t have much to say about the course content, though one described it as \u201cgood for an intro course.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Klein as \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201csuperb,\u201d and \u201camazing.\u201d As one student wrote, Klein \u201cis quite stimulating and makes the lectures something to look forward to.\u201d Several students commented on Klein\u2019s interactive teaching style, which encouraged class participation even in the large lecture. Students felt that Klein made the difficult topics \u201ceasy to understand\u201d and that he was very accessible for help before exams.\r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 one complaint was exam difficulty. Exams were multiple-choice, non-calculator, and without partial credit, so \u201ca simple mistake could have meant the difference between getting a good grade and failing.\u201d There also was no curve applied, and \u201ctest averages were around 70.\u201d", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/16315/sections/001/reviews/149-JOSHUA-R--KLEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/149-JOSHUA-R--KLEIN", "first_name": "JOSHUA R.", "last_name": "KLEIN", "id": "149-JOSHUA-R--KLEIN", "name": "JOSHUA R.
