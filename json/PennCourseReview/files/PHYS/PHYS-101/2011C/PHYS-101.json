Students who master classical mechanics\r\noften report that, in addition to acquiring some of the tools they will need for future\r\nstudies in science, mathematics, medicine, or engineering, they have also gained a new\r\nappreciation for the beauty of everyday phenomena and have substantially developed\r\ntheir reasoning skills. Physics 101 lab is a co-requisite.\r\nSome students thought that this course was the \u201cbest science course\u201d they took at\r\nPenn. However, others thought that this course required too much memorization and\r\ndidn\u2019t focus enough on actually understanding the material in an applicable manner.\r\nStudents overall thought that Professor Drndic was an extremely fair professor.\r\nShe was \u201capproachable\u201d and willing to alter the class schedule \u201cbased on what students\r\nfelt worked and didn\u2019t work.\u201d Professor Drndic was quick to respond to emails which\r\nmade it easier for students to get extra help. However, some students felt that the course\r\nwas disorganized and that Professor Drndic \u201clacked the ability to stimulate\u201d the students.\r\nShe spent too much time on the first half of the course and had to speed through the\r\nsecond half of the course, which made it difficult for some students to keep up.\r\nOverall, students thought that this was an easy course. They found Professor\r\nDrndic\u2019s grading to be extremely fair. This course is suggested for students in a prehealth\r\nprogram.
