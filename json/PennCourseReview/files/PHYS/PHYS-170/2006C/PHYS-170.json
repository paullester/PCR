{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2071"}, "description": "This course parallels and extends the content of PHYS 150, at a significantly higher mathematical level. Recommended for well-prepared students in engineering and the physical sciences, and particularly for those planning to major in physics. Classical laws of motion: interaction between particles; conservation laws and symmetry principles; rigid body motion; noninertial reference frames; oscillations. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "HONORS PHYSICS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9418/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.85", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.65", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.95"}, "section": {"name": "HONORS PHYSICS I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHYS-170-301", "path": "/courses/9418/sections/301", "id": "9418-301", "aliases": ["PHYS-170-301"]}, "comments": "Evaluators said Dr. Mele was an excellent instructor, but many students felt the assigned problem sets, while helpful and interesting, were also difficult.", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/9418/sections/301/reviews/982-EUGENE-J-MELE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/982-EUGENE-J-MELE", "first_name": "EUGENE J", "last_name": "MELE", "id": "982-EUGENE-J-MELE", "name": "EUGENE J MELE"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "9418-301-982-EUGENE-J-MELE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-170", "path": "/courses/9418", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9418/sections", "values": [{"name": "HONORS PHYSICS I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PHYS-170-301", "path": "/courses/9418/sections/301", "id": "9418-301", "aliases": ["PHYS-170-301"]}]}, "id": 9418, "aliases": ["PHYS-170"]}
