{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4385"}, "description": "This introduction to cosmology will cover standard big bang cosmology, formation of large-scale structure, theories of the early universe and their observational predictions, and models of dark energy. It is intended for graduate students or advanced undergraduates. No prior knowledge of general relativity or field theory will be assumed, although aspects of each will be introduced as part of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PARTICLE COSMOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16329/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.87", "rRecommendMajor": "3.93", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.93", "rReadingsValue": "2.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.64", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.93"}, "section": {"name": "PARTICLE COSMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-517-001", "path": "/courses/16329/sections/001", "id": "16329-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-517-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/16329/sections/001/reviews/4530-JUSTIN-KHOURY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4530-JUSTIN-KHOURY", "first_name": "JUSTIN", "last_name": "KHOURY", "id": "4530-JUSTIN-KHOURY", "name": "JUSTIN KHOURY"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "16329-001-4530-JUSTIN-KHOURY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PHYS-517", "path": "/courses/16329", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16329/sections", "values": [{"name": "PARTICLE COSMOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PHYS-517-001", "path": "/courses/16329/sections/001", "id": "16329-001", "aliases": ["PHYS-517-001"]}]}, "id": 16329, "aliases": ["PHYS-517"]}
