It explores competing contemporary social science theories and related empirical research on \u201cleadership.\u201d It involves intensive case-based analysis, interviews with \u201cleaders\u201d from diverse sectors, and site-based projects conducted by student task groups.\r\n\r\nStudents had very positive feelings about the course, describing it as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cfantastic.\u201d Students generally seemed to view the course content as interesting and applicable to their own lives. Time was reportedly equally split between discussion and lecture. One student gushes: \u201cI can honestly say that [this] class fundamentally changed my outlook for the better.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents repeatedly described Professor DiIulio as one of the best professors at Penn, praising him for his passionate lectures and empathy for students. Nearly all of the reviews that were submitted heaped praise upon DiIulio. He is reportedly a \u201ccaptivating\u201d and \u201cunbelievable\u201d lecturer. A student claims the following: \u201cStories of John DiIulio\u2019s teaching prowess are not exaggerated.\u201d\r\n\r\nVery few complaints were registered about the workload. The course seemed to be regarded as not too difficult, with a reasonable amount of work. The class features guest speakers and is heavy on personal development. One student reported that the course was a \u201cbit reading intensive\u201d but goes on to say that the readings were both interesting and useful. There are no prerequisites for the course.
