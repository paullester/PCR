In order to grasp the usefulness of the theoretical ideas presented in readings and lectures, abstract concepts are linked with a study of the national security policies states have adopted in the decades following World War II. Topics include the fundamental distinctions among the alternative strategies available to states, the various strategies the U.S. and other countries have adopted, the links between military forces and strategy, the lessons one might draw from the history of international security relations during the Cold War, and the new sources of conflict and the prospects for continued international peace in the post-Cold War world.\r\n\r\nStudents thoroughly enjoyed this class and found it highly interesting. Many reported learning a lot and felt that each class covered a significant amount of information. While students appreciated the overall structure of the course, some noted that they \u201cwish there was more integration of current events\u201d and others believed that the material became mildly repetitive at certain points during the semester.  Countless students declared that this was the best class they have taken at Penn.\r\n\r\nStudents regarded Professor Goldstein as being \u201cfantastic, engaging and magical.\u201d They enjoyed his teaching style, organization and communication skills, although a few noted that Professor Goldstein talks too quickly at times. Most agreed that \u201cProfessor Goldstein brings an exciting atmosphere to lecture that makes it worthwhile to attend,\u201d and many looked forward to taking another class of his in upcoming semesters. \r\n\r\nSome were overwhelmed by the amount of assigned reading each week and found the midterm to be a bit long. However, the majority believed that it was well worth it to take this course. Students commented that both Political Science majors and non-majors would benefit from taking this class.
