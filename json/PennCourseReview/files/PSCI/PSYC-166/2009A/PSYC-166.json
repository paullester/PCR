{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1469"}, "description": "An introduction to the study of positive emotions, positive character traits, and positive institutions. The positive emotions consist of emotions about the past (e.g., serenity, satisfaction, pride), about the future (e.g., hope, optimism, faith), and emotions about the present (pleasure and gratification). The distinction among the pleasant life, the good life, and the meaningful life is drawn. The positive traits include wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and spirituality, and the classification of these virtues is explored. The positive institutions are exemplified by extended families, free press, humane leadership, and representative government. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "INTRO.POSITIVE PSYCH.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16379/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.40", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.04", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "2.96", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO.POSITIVE PSYCH.", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSYC-166-001", "path": "/courses/16379/sections/001", "id": "16379-001", "aliases": ["PSYC-166-001"]}, "comments": "Positive psychology is the scientific study of happiness, meaning, engagement, accomplishment, and virtue.

However, students concurred that Professor Duckworth\u2019s \u201cdynamic,\u201d \u201capproachable,\u201d and \u201cexuberant\u201d teaching style made her class worth taking.\r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 biggest criticism were the \u201cextremely challenging multiple choice exams\u201d which \u201cdidn\u2019t adequately reflect what\u201d students knew based on lectures alone. Many found that the \u201creadings were overwhelming at times\u201d but pointed out that Professor Duckworth decreased the reading burden late in the semester. One student recommended taking a statistics course before enrolling, but most suggested the class to anyone truly interested in \u201clearning about happiness and how to improve your own well-being.\u201d", "num_students": 123, "path": "/courses/16379/sections/001/reviews/3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH", "first_name": "ANGELA LEE", "last_name": "DUCKWORTH", "id": "3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH", "name": "ANGELA LEE DUCKWORTH"}, "num_reviewers": 118, "id": "16379-001-3612-ANGELA-LEE-DUCKWORTH"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.46", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO.POSITIVE PSYCH.", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PSYC-166-601", "path": "/courses/16379/sections/601", "id": "16379-601", "aliases": ["PSYC-166-601"]}, "comments": "Positive psychology is the scientific study of happiness, meaning, engagement, accomplishment, and virtue.
