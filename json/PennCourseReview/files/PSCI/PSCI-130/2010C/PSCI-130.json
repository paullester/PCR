{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/920"}, "description": "This course is intended to introduce students to the national institutions and political processes of American government. What are the historical and philosophical foundations of the American Republic? How does American public policy get made, who makes it, and who benefits? Is a constitutional fabric woven in 1787 good enough for today? How, if at all, should American government be changed, and why? What is politics and why bother to study it? If these sorts of questions interest you, then this course will be a congenial home. It is designed to explore such questions while teaching students the basics of American politics and government. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "INTRO TO AMER POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23662/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.99", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.65", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.03", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "2.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.96", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO AMER POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-130-001", "path": "/courses/23662/sections/001", "id": "23662-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-130-001"]}, "comments": "This course is intended to introduce students to the national institutions and political processes of American government: the historical and philosophical foundations of the American Republic: the significance of politics; how American public policy is made, who makes it, and who benefits; the modern application of the constitutional fabric woven in 1787; how, if at all, should American government be changed. \r\n\r\nOverall, students felt generally positive about the course material, calling the class \u201cthought-provoking\u201d and \u201cvaluable.\u201d One student wrote that it was \u201ca perfect starting point for anyone interested in American politics.\u201d Several, however, expressed their dissatisfaction that the course did not live up to their high expectations. \u201cThis class is a lot of hype,\u201d wrote one student, calling the lectures \u201cforgettable.\u201d Many complained that \u201cthe two-hour lecture was too long\u201d to hold their attention, despite their interest in the material.\r\n\r\nReactions to Professor DiIulio were overwhelmingly positive.
