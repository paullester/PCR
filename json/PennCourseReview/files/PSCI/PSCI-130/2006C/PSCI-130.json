{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/920"}, "description": "This course is intended to introduce students to the national institutions and political processes of American government. What are the historical and philosophical foundations of the American Republic? How does American public policy get made, who makes it, and who benefits? Is a constitutional fabric woven in 1787 good enough for today? How, if at all, should American government be changed, and why? What is politics and why bother to study it? If these sorts of questions interest you, then this course will be a congenial home. It is designed to explore such questions while teaching students the basics of American politics and government. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "INTRO TO AMER POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9437/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "2.61", "rReadingsValue": "3.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.07", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO AMER POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-130-001", "path": "/courses/9437/sections/001", "id": "9437-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-130-001"]}, "comments": "Students had overwhelming praise for Dr. DiIulio, including many students stating that he is the best professor they have taken at Penn.  Evaluators noted that his passion for the material clearly shows and that he is genuinely excited about teaching it to students.  \u201cImpressive\u201d guest speakers were appreciated by the students.  Two major complaints were issued about the course.  The first was that the tests were strictly multiple choice and did not give students an opportunity to fully demonstrate their knowledge.  The second was that without a recitation students never had an opportunity to think critically and discuss/argue about course concepts.  \r\n*Note:  Less than 25% of students submitted written evaluations for this class\r\n", "num_students": 213, "path": "/courses/9437/sections/001/reviews/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "first_name": "JOHN J.", "last_name": "DIIULIO", "id": "994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "name": "JOHN J.
