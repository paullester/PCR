{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/920"}, "description": "This course is intended to introduce students to the national institutions and political processes of American government. What are the historical and philosophical foundations of the American Republic? How does American public policy get made, who makes it, and who benefits? Is a constitutional fabric woven in 1787 good enough for today? How, if at all, should American government be changed, and why? What is politics and why bother to study it? If these sorts of questions interest you, then this course will be a congenial home. It is designed to explore such questions while teaching students the basics of American politics and government. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "LECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/920/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.64", "rInstructorAccess": "2.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "LECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-130-001", "path": "/courses/920/sections/001", "id": "920-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 123, "path": "/courses/920/sections/001/reviews/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "first_name": "JOHN J.", "last_name": "DIIULIO", "id": "994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "name": "JOHN J.
