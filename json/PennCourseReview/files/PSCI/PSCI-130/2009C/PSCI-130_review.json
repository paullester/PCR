Some of the fundamental questions that this class grapples with are: what are the historical and philosophical foundations of the American Republic; how does American public policy get made, who makes it, and who benefits; is a constitutional fabric woven in 1787 good enough for today; and what is politics and why bother to study it? Readings include The Federalist Papers, \u201cThe Wilson Text,\u201d \u201cThe Bose Reader,\u201d Get Out the Vote: How to Increase Voter Turnout, and Politics Lost: How American Democracy was Trivialized by People Who Think You\u2019re Stupid. \r\n\r\nMany students found this class \u201cinteresting\u201d and a great introductory class. One student even claimed he/she believed this class should be a college requirement because \u201cthough concepts are probably basic from the perspective of a political scientist, it would be a good thing for our country if more people understood even these basic concepts.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents highly praised Professor DiIulio \u2013 they commonly reported he was \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201chad good stories,\u201d and \u201centertaining;\u201d many students claimed Professor DiIulio was one of the best teachers they have ever had. Students also said that Professor DiIulio was very accessible and able to stimulate interest in the material very well. \r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the Society sector and is highly recommended for freshmen considering a Political Science or another humanities major. Many students complained about the somewhat excessive amounts of reading. While some students found the exams to be challenging and heavily focused on the readings, the majority of students believed that it was a fairly easy introductory class. \r\n", "num_students": 202, "path": "/courses/17949/sections/001/reviews/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "first_name": "JOHN J.", "last_name": "DIIULIO", "id": "994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "name": "JOHN J.
