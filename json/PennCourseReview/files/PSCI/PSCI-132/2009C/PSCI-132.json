Students really liked that the class forced \u201cintrospection,\u201d claiming that they learned a lot about themselves. Many students claimed it was the best class they had every taken. One student explained, \u201cwhile you may not learn \u2018real world skills,\u2019 I learned some far more valuable things about myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students were very impressed that Professor DiIulio made time for his students outside of class and found it useful to have him as a recitation instructor. One student said, \u201cDr. DiIulio was able to spark interest in subjects that would otherwise seem somewhat boring,\u201d and another declared, \u201cUnlike most famous or brilliant professors, he actually cares for his students, and will make the effort to ensure you get the most out of the course.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are no prerequisites for this class, and it is recommended for both majors and non-majors. Some found the workload to be challenging in terms of length of reading and writing assignments required, but overall, students really enjoyed the class. \r\n", "num_students": 54, "path": "/courses/17950/sections/601/reviews/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "first_name": "JOHN J.", "last_name": "DIIULIO", "id": "994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "name": "JOHN J.
