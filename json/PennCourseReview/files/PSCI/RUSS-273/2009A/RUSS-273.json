{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4410"}, "description": "Fiscal, administrative, and political decentralization have become the centerpiece of governance reforms throughout both the developed and developing worlds. The main arguments for adoption of these governance practices include the demand driven nature, greater openness and economic effectiveness of local administrations. Are these expectations getting empirical confirmations? The course will examine the pros and cons of the increasing power of the local against the existing evidence of actual decentralization reforms, putting both theory and practice into specific political, historical, and economic contexts. National case studies of successes and failures of the main recent decentralization reforms and arrangements will be presented; special attention will be paid to the role of international agencies in rendering decentralization more or less effective and sustainable. Case studies will be drawn primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe; the main other recent cases of dramatic decentralization (e.g. India, Indonesia) will be examined as well. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "Development,Democracy&Postsoc:Processes&Outcomes of Decentralizat.
