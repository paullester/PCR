Complementing offerings in other departments, this course emphasizes events in the period since the Chinese Communist Party established its regime in 1949. In addition to surveying the political history of contemporary China, we will assess the meaning of these events by drawing upon theories about the nature and significance of ideology and organization in communist regimes, factionalism and its relationship to policy formulation and implementation, and general issues of political and economic development. Although the principal focus is on the domestic politics of the PRC, the course includes several lectures examining Chinas international relations. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "CONTEMP CHINESE POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5789/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.51", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.02", "rCommAbility": "3.81", "rInstructorQuality": "3.81"}, "section": {"name": "CONTEMP CHINESE POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-219-001", "path": "/courses/5789/sections/001", "id": "5789-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-219-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 55, "path": "/courses/5789/sections/001/reviews/996-AVERY-M--GOLDSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/996-AVERY-M--GOLDSTEIN", "first_name": "AVERY M.", "last_name": "GOLDSTEIN", "id": "996-AVERY-M--GOLDSTEIN", "name": "AVERY M.
