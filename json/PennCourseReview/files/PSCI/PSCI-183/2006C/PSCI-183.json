{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2385"}, "description": "Whether America begins with the Puritans and the Mayflower Compact, or with the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution, it is founded in resistance to empire. In the generations between, Americans have desired, dreaded and debated empire. This course will focus on empire and imperialism in American political thought. We will read primary texts addressing empire: from the departure and dissent of the Puritans, and Burke's Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies, to twentieth and twenty-first century debates over America's role in the world. These texts will include political pamphlets and speeches, poetry, novels, policy papers and film. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "AMERICAN POLIT THOUGHT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9443/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.12", "rDifficulty": "2.49", "rStimulateInterest": "3.12", "rRecommendMajor": "3.41", "rCourseQuality": "3.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.49", "rInstructorAccess": "2.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.49", "rInstructorQuality": "3.39"}, "section": {"name": "AMERICAN POLIT THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-183-001", "path": "/courses/9443/sections/001", "id": "9443-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-183-001"]}, "comments": "Students almost unanimously claimed Dr. Norton to be an \u201cexcellent professor,\u201d although few specifics were given on her teaching style.\r\n<br>*Note:  Less than 25% of students submitted written evaluations for this class\r\n", "num_students": 95, "path": "/courses/9443/sections/001/reviews/264-ANNE-NORTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/264-ANNE-NORTON", "first_name": "ANNE", "last_name": "NORTON", "id": "264-ANNE-NORTON", "name": "ANNE NORTON"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "9443-001-264-ANNE-NORTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-183", "path": "/courses/9443", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9443/sections", "values": [{"name": "AMERICAN POLIT THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-183-001", "path": "/courses/9443/sections/001", "id": "9443-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-183-001"]}]}, "id": 9443, "aliases": ["PSCI-183"]}
