{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2385"}, "description": "Whether America begins with the Puritans and the Mayflower Compact, or with the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution, it is founded in resistance to empire. In the generations between, Americans have desired, dreaded and debated empire. This course will focus on empire and imperialism in American political thought. We will read primary texts addressing empire: from the departure and dissent of the Puritans, and Burke's Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies, to twentieth and twenty-first century debates over America's role in the world. These texts will include political pamphlets and speeches, poetry, novels, policy papers and film. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "AMERICAN POL THOUGHT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17956/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.40", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "2.78", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "2.55", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "AMERICAN POL THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-183-001", "path": "/courses/17956/sections/001", "id": "17956-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-183-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 103, "path": "/courses/17956/sections/001/reviews/264-ANNE-NORTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/264-ANNE-NORTON", "first_name": "ANNE", "last_name": "NORTON", "id": "264-ANNE-NORTON", "name": "ANNE NORTON"}, "num_reviewers": 90, "id": "17956-001-264-ANNE-NORTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-183", "path": "/courses/17956", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17956/sections", "values": [{"name": "AMERICAN POL THOUGHT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-183-001", "path": "/courses/17956/sections/001", "id": "17956-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-183-001"]}]}, "id": 17956, "aliases": ["PSCI-183"]}
