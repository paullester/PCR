An underlying theme of the course is the tension between the presidency, leadership, and democracy.\r\n\r\nStudents generally had positive feelings about the content of the course. For the most part, they agreed that both the lecture and readings were interesting and relevant. Many students mentioned that they \u201clearned a lot\u201d from the course. However, a few students expressed discontent with the consistent slant of the readings. One stated the following: \u201cReadings could have been more balanced, since most [came] blatantly from the left wing.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Gottschalk was relatively well-liked by the students, being described as a \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cdevoted\u201d lecturer. Students praised the fact that she was \u201calways willing to stop and answer student questions.\u201d One student relates that Gottschalk is one of the \u201cnicest professors\u201d at Penn, while another lauds her sharp sense of humor.\r\n\r\nStudents considered the course to be somewhat difficult, with a decent workload. One student complained that the two large papers were \u201cgraded rather harshly.\u201d Another student registered a complaint about being forced to buy and carry a bulk pack of books, saying this \u201cmade the reading more of a chore.\u201d On the other hand, most other students had no such complaints, and the level of difficulty appears reasonable. The course was open to all students, with no prerequisites.
