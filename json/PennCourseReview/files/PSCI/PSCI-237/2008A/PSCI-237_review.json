The course focuses on contemporary politics in India and Pakistan. The greater part of the course analyzes the social and political dynamics of democracy in India, but the material is also relevant to better understanding the difficulties encountered by Pakistan in defining a core identity and a stable form of government.\r\n\r\nOverall, students enjoyed this class calling it \u201ca joy to take\u201d and \u201cvery informative.\u201d They also liked how Professor Frankel integrated films, readings, and lectures to give students a better understanding of the subject. However, students did have grievances with the class structure and content, saying they wished the class would also include information on other South Asian countries.   \u201cA course on contemporary South Asian politics should not ignore the larger dynamics of the region,\u201d said one student. \r\n\r\nStudents liked Professor Frankel, commenting that it was \u201ca privilege to learn from such a renowned professor\u201d and that she was always \u201cvery helpful during office hours.\u201d However they wished she had given better feedback on paper topics.\r\n\r\nStudents found the hardest part of the course were the papers as the assigned subject was often very broad and it was hard to know what the professor was looking for. They also mentioned that there were too many assigned readings and that it was difficult to keep up with the pace of the class. \u201cAt a certain point the value of so many readings greatly diminishes and becomes incredibly difficult to analyze and comprehend.\u201d Students commented that there was not enough time between paper assignments, as papers were not handed back before the next one was due.", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/20734/sections/001/reviews/1938-MARIE-GOTTSCHALK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1938-MARIE-GOTTSCHALK", "first_name": "MARIE", "last_name": "GOTTSCHALK", "id": "1938-MARIE-GOTTSCHALK", "name": "MARIE GOTTSCHALK"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "20734-001-1938-MARIE-GOTTSCHALK"}]
