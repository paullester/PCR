Human rights are part of a wide range of academic disciplines, engineering, history, law, philosophy, and religion being among the obvious. These disciplinary perspectives will be touched upon; politics will be the central one. Some of the main topics include justifications; cross-cultural perspectives; global and international institutional developments and foreign policy. Selected topics will include war, hunger, life, reproduction, servitude, consent, information and the environment.\r\n\r\nA vast majority of students really loved this \u201cstraightforward\u201d and \u201cthought-provoking\u201d class, even if they had no previously experience or interest in global human rights issues. Even though there is a lot of reading for this course, students felt everything was fresh, as the class used lecture, discussion, video clips, and films to help supplement the material. Overall, students believed this course was not very challenging, yet very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nProfessor Doherty-Sil received unanimously positive reviews from students, being described as \u201cpassionate, engaging, friendly, funny, and dedicated.\u201d Furthermore, students believed she was extremely approachable and willing to help if necessary. This \u201cinspiring\u201d professor expects a lot from her students, but students are \u201chappy to do the work\u201d because they believe she \u201cworks as hard as her students.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course was described as \u201crelatively basic, but fun\u201d and students would recommend it to anyone interested in human rights.\r\n\r\n*This review was based on 8 student reviews. \r\n", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/25016/sections/001/reviews/3336-EILEEN-M--DOHERTY-SIL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3336-EILEEN-M--DOHERTY-SIL", "first_name": "EILEEN M.", "last_name": "DOHERTY-SIL", "id": "3336-EILEEN-M--DOHERTY-SIL", "name": "EILEEN M.
