{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1456"}, "description": "This course will present an in-depth examination of political, economic and social change in post-Soviet Russia within a historical context. After a brief discussion of contemporary problems in Russia, the first half of the course will delve into the rise of communism in 1917, the evolution of the Soviet regime, and the tensions between ideology and practice over the seventy years of communist rule up until 1985. The second part of the course will begin with an examination of the Gorbachev period and the competing interpretations of how the events between 1985 and 1991 may have contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will then proceed to make sense of the continuities and changes in politics, economics and society in contemporary Russia. Important topics will include the confrontations accompanying the adoption of a new constitution, the emergence of competing ideologies and parties, the struggle over economic privatization, the question of federalism and nationalism, social and political implicatons of economic reform, and prospects for Russia's future in the Putin and post-Putin era. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "RUSSIAN POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17959/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "3.03", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.58"}, "section": {"name": "RUSSIAN POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-217-001", "path": "/courses/17959/sections/001", "id": "17959-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-217-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/17959/sections/001/reviews/988-RUDRA-SIL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/988-RUDRA-SIL", "first_name": "RUDRA", "last_name": "SIL", "id": "988-RUDRA-SIL", "name": "RUDRA SIL"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "17959-001-988-RUDRA-SIL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-217", "path": "/courses/17959", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17959/sections", "values": [{"name": "RUSSIAN POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-217-001", "path": "/courses/17959/sections/001", "id": "17959-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-217-001"]}]}, "id": 17959, "aliases": ["PSCI-217"]}
