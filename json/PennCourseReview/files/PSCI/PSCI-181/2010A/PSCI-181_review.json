The course considers the political forms that emerged out of the struggles of this relationship, as well as the changed and distinctly \"modern\" conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom, responsibility, justice, rights and obligations, as central categories for organizing moral and political life.\r\nMany students commented that although this class was interesting, the lectures were often \u201cdisjointed, disorganized, and freewheeling.\u201d The recitations for this class, however, were found to be not only informative, but also very helpful.\r\nProf. Norton was described by students as an \u201canimated lecturer\u201d, exuding \u201can energy that is inspiring.\u201d Nevertheless, even her biggest fans agreed that she \u201ctended to go on tangents minimally related to the topic.\u201d Although some students thought that these extra anecdotes gave the class a \u201cbroader relevance,\u201d most objected to the musings.\r\nStudents recommended this course as an excellent foundational class for all political science majors, but warned that the reading assignments were extensive and time-consuming. PSCI 181 fulfills the History and Tradition Sector.
