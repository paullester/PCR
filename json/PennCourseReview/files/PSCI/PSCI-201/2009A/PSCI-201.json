Often their respective answers or \"theories\" differ widely; and sometimes even their most widely agreed-upon answers seem to defy common sense or ask us to believe in highly improbable findings. This new lecture course familiarizes students with different approaches to understanding politics, society, and social science in relation to everyday questions, intriguing puzzles, and improbable findings about human behavior. It focuses on contemporary American politics and society, and draws mainly on literatures featuring work by leading U.S. social scientists.
