{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4391"}, "description": "Everyday human behavior poses puzzles that political scientists, economists, sociologists, and other social scientists have attempted to answer. Often their respective answers or \"theories\" differ widely; and sometimes even their most widely agreed-upon answers seem to defy common sense or ask us to believe in highly improbable findings. This new lecture course familiarizes students with different approaches to understanding politics, society, and social science in relation to everyday questions, intriguing puzzles, and improbable findings about human behavior. It focuses on contemporary American politics and society, and draws mainly on literatures featuring work by leading U.S. social scientists. In addition, the course explores the conceptual boundaries between the political, social, and economic domains in which people interact with one another; the differences among and between different much-acclaimed models for understanding human behavior; and the philosophical underpinnings and moral implications associated with schools of thought about how best to describe, analyze, and evaluate what people do--and why they do it! \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "Politics, Society, and Social Science", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16826/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.46", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "Politics, Society, and Social Science", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "PSCI-201-910", "path": "/courses/16826/sections/910", "id": "16826-910", "aliases": ["PSCI-201-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/16826/sections/910/reviews/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "first_name": "JOHN J.", "last_name": "DIIULIO", "id": "994-JOHN-J--DIIULIO", "name": "JOHN J.
