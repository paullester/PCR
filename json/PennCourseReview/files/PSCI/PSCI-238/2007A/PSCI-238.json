{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/931"}, "description": "This course is designed to introduce students to the study of Congress and of legislative behavior generally. The course will examine legislative procedures, congressional institutions (committees, subcommittees, leadership structure), campaigns and elections, legistative behavior (voting, constituency service, policy leadership), and the policymaking environment (interest groups, executive branch, media). Particular emphasis will be placed on consideration of whether and how electoral concerns affect legislative behavior and the structure of congressional institutions. In addition, the course will consider congressional behavior within the broader context of representation. There are no prerequisites for this class, but students are expected to have at least a rudimentary understanding of American politics and government. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "THE AMER LEGIS PROCESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15055/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "2.03", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.69", "rReadingsValue": "1.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.51", "rCommAbility": "2.47", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "THE AMER LEGIS PROCESS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-238-001", "path": "/courses/15055/sections/001", "id": "15055-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-238-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/15055/sections/001/reviews/4082-JOHN-S--LAPINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4082-JOHN-S--LAPINSKI", "first_name": "JOHN S.", "last_name": "LAPINSKI", "id": "4082-JOHN-S--LAPINSKI", "name": "JOHN S.
