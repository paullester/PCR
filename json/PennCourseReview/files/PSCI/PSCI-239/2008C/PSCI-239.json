{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1458"}, "description": "This class focuses on explaining voters' behavior in elections. Throughout the term, we will take up a variety of questions related to this theme, such as: What factors are most influential when voters select a candidate? How much does the economy matter to election outcomes, and why is this important? Why do some Americans turn out to vote while others do not? Do campaign events actually influence voters? Do advertisements (and media coverage of elections in general) inform or mislead the public? This course will explore these and other related questions to give students a comprehensive understanding of what drives elections in the United States. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ELECTIONS IN THE U.S.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19207/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "3.28", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.41", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.03"}, "section": {"name": "ELECTIONS IN THE U.S.", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-239-001", "path": "/courses/19207/sections/001", "id": "19207-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-239-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/19207/sections/001/reviews/4536-MATTHEW-STEPHEN-LEVENDUSKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4536-MATTHEW-STEPHEN-LEVENDUSKY", "first_name": "MATTHEW STEPHEN", "last_name": "LEVENDUSKY", "id": "4536-MATTHEW-STEPHEN-LEVENDUSKY", "name": "MATTHEW STEPHEN LEVENDUSKY"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "19207-001-4536-MATTHEW-STEPHEN-LEVENDUSKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-239", "path": "/courses/19207", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19207/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELECTIONS IN THE U.S.", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-239-001", "path": "/courses/19207/sections/001", "id": "19207-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-239-001"]}]}, "id": 19207, "aliases": ["PSCI-239"]}
