{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2902"}, "description": "This course explores the political economy of European integration. It is organized in three parts: First, we analyze the political and economic forces that have driven the process of European integration since World War II. We review the milestones of European integration in historical perspective and discuss different theoretical perspectives explaining the path and outcome of European integration. Second, the course takes an in-depth look at the institutions and decision-making processes of the European Union (EU). It analyzes the structure and operation of the Council of Ministers, the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Court of Justice, and explores how these institutions interact to shape EU policy. Third, we examine EU policymaking in key policy areas, including regulatory policies, redistributive politics, economic and monetary affairs, and external relations. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "POL.
