The course will analyze the interplay between politics and economics in three broad areas: international trade, international finance, and economic development. In each section, we will first discuss economic theories that explain the causes and consequences of international commerce, capital flows, and economic growth. We will then explore how political interests, institutions, and ideas alter these predictions, examining both historical examples and current policy debates.\r\n\tStudents felt that the powerpoint slides and the textbook made the material \u201cvery clear,\u201d and also felt that the course material was interesting unto itself. However, some students felt that the exams were too focused on \u201cminutia from the assigned readings\u201d and did not accurately test knowledge of the course material. The course was overall described as \u201cinteresting but a little boring,\u201d a sentiment that many students seemed to share.  Another student noted that only \u201c1/3 of the class attends lecture.\u201d\r\n\tProfessor Gray was criticized as a below-average professor: students felt that she \u201cmakes the material less interesting than it actually is.\u201d Other students noted that Professor Gray seemed to \u201ccare more about her research than her students,\u201d and some faulted her for not being flexible enough when it came to student requests.\r\n \tStudents were interested by the course material, but not thrilled with Professor Gray. The exams were described as somewhat difficult, but otherwise the workload was not commented upon.", "num_students": 97, "path": "/courses/28041/sections/001/reviews/5862-JULIA-GRAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5862-JULIA-GRAY", "first_name": "JULIA", "last_name": "GRAY", "id": "5862-JULIA-GRAY", "name": "JULIA GRAY"}, "num_reviewers": 88, "id": "28041-001-5862-JULIA-GRAY"}]
