{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4389"}, "description": "This course examines the politics of international economic relations. The course will analyze the interplay between politics and economics in three broad areas: international trade, international finance, and economic development. In each section, we will first discuss economic theories that explain the causes and consequences of international commerce, capital flows, and economic growth. We will then explore how political interests, institutions, and ideas alter these predictions, examining both historical examples and current policy debates. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "INTERNATIONAL POL ECON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26656/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.16", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.81", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorQuality": "3.51"}, "section": {"name": "INTERNATIONAL POL ECON", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-152-001", "path": "/courses/26656/sections/001", "id": "26656-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-152-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/26656/sections/001/reviews/4084-MARK-A-POLLACK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4084-MARK-A-POLLACK", "first_name": "MARK A", "last_name": "POLLACK", "id": "4084-MARK-A-POLLACK", "name": "MARK A POLLACK"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "26656-001-4084-MARK-A-POLLACK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-152", "path": "/courses/26656", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26656/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERNATIONAL POL ECON", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-152-001", "path": "/courses/26656/sections/001", "id": "26656-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-152-001"]}]}, "id": 26656, "aliases": ["PSCI-152"]}
