The course will be divided into three segments: the \"democratic citizen\" (in which we will explore ethical issues pertaining to the experience of democracy as a way of life); the \"democratic People\" (in which we investigate some of the best and most recent attempts to come to grips with the exceedingly difficult, yet fundamental, notion of the People); and the \"democratic world\" (in which we examine various issues pertaining to democratization and development, including the problems of group rights and representation, wars on behalf of democracy, and the impact of recent technological trends on the practice of democracy. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "INTRO TO DEMOCRATIC THRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19214/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.92", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.92", "rWorkRequired": "3.08", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.08", "rCommAbility": "3.92", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO DEMOCRATIC THRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-281-001", "path": "/courses/19214/sections/001", "id": "19214-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-281-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/19214/sections/001/reviews/4538-JEFFREY-E--GREEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4538-JEFFREY-E--GREEN", "first_name": "JEFFREY E.", "last_name": "GREEN", "id": "4538-JEFFREY-E--GREEN", "name": "JEFFREY E.
