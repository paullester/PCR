Students were encouraged to think outside of the box. The class focused on comparing between Israel and South Africa and was able to stimulate an interesting discussion. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;There are mixed comments for Professor Vitalis. Some students thought the professor was \u201cintellectually demanding\u201d and \u201cprovocative\u201d. The class is taught in a seminar style to a class of over 100 people. As such, some students thought the class was very disorganized and Professor Vitalis did not come with a prepared set of notes. Students that enjoyed the class learned a lot from the discussions. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;There are no quizzes, homework assignments, tests nor midterms for the class. Students read 5 books and wrote book reports. The class format did not allow for any lazy academic work.
