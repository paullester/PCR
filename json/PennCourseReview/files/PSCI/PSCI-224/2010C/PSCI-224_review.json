A broader social science approach is adopted, one which emphasizes the need to understand the social structures and cultures of the developing countries, the capabilities of weak versus strong states, and the links with the international system that influence transformative processes to which industrializing economies are subjected. The readings offer an overview of the most influential theories of development and underdevelopment that structured debate from the 1960's through the 1990's,and focus on the elements of these approaches that advance understanding of development and stagnation in several key countries, including Brazil, Mexico, India and selected countries in East and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that the course material was \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cinformative.\u201d Despite their appreciation of the content, however, many felt that the presentation was \u201cslightly chaotic\u201d and \u201cunstructured.\u201d\r\n\r\nReactions to Professor Kapur were quite mixed.
