{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3923"}, "description": "The course surveys some of the principal themes in the political economies of lower income countries. The questions we shall seek to address cover a broad terrain. Who are the key actors? What are their beliefs, interests and motivations? What are their constraints? How are these being affected by closer economic linkages between national economies? While there is no single integrative framework or paradigm into which these themes neatly fit, a common thread is the changing dynamics and interplay between the local, the national, and the global. A familiarity with basic economic concepts will be helpful, but is not necessary. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "POL ECON OF DEVELOPMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17960/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "2.66", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.10", "rInstructorAccess": "2.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.74", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "2.87", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "POL ECON OF DEVELOPMENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-224-001", "path": "/courses/17960/sections/001", "id": "17960-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-224-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/17960/sections/001/reviews/4081-DEVESH-KAPUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4081-DEVESH-KAPUR", "first_name": "DEVESH", "last_name": "KAPUR", "id": "4081-DEVESH-KAPUR", "name": "DEVESH KAPUR"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "17960-001-4081-DEVESH-KAPUR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-224", "path": "/courses/17960", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17960/sections", "values": [{"name": "POL ECON OF DEVELOPMENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-224-001", "path": "/courses/17960/sections/001", "id": "17960-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-224-001"]}]}, "id": 17960, "aliases": ["PSCI-224"]}
