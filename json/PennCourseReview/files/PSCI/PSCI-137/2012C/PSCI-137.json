This course provides students with a framework for understanding the policy-making process that allows them to answer this question. Specifically, the course considers how interests, ideas, and institutions all come together to generate public policy. The capstone of the course is a final project, where students work collaboratively to apply the framework from the course to a contemporary public policy area. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "Policymaking in American Politics", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29538/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "Policymaking in American Politics", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PSCI-137-601", "path": "/courses/29538/sections/601", "id": "29538-601", "aliases": ["PSCI-137-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/29538/sections/601/reviews/3315-DEIRDRE-MARTINEZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3315-DEIRDRE-MARTINEZ", "first_name": "DEIRDRE", "last_name": "MARTINEZ", "id": "3315-DEIRDRE-MARTINEZ", "name": "DEIRDRE MARTINEZ"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "29538-601-3315-DEIRDRE-MARTINEZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-137", "path": "/courses/29538", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29538/sections", "values": [{"name": "Policymaking in American Politics", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "PSCI-137-601", "path": "/courses/29538/sections/601", "id": "29538-601", "aliases": ["PSCI-137-601"]}]}, "id": 29538, "aliases": ["PSCI-137"]}
