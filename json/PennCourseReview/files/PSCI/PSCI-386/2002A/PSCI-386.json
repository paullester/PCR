{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/940"}, "description": "The words \"constitutional\" and \"democratic\" represent the gold standard of the contemporary policial lexicon. This course will elaborate a political theory of rule-of-law government by the people. Using classical works of policial theory, it sets out a systematic, multi-level picture of constitutional democracy as: a reflection of nature, an aspiration of humanity, a movement in civilization, a way of civic life for a people, a form of polity, an institutionalization of government, and a design for citizenship. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "THE CONST OF DEMOCRACY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/940/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "3.59", "rStimulateInterest": "3.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.68", "rCourseQuality": "3.59", "rWorkRequired": "3.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "3.48", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "THE CONST OF DEMOCRACY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-386-001", "path": "/courses/940/sections/001", "id": "940-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-386-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/940/sections/001/reviews/1012-WILLIAM-F-HARRIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1012-WILLIAM-F-HARRIS", "first_name": "WILLIAM F", "last_name": "HARRIS", "id": "1012-WILLIAM-F-HARRIS", "name": "WILLIAM F HARRIS"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "940-001-1012-WILLIAM-F-HARRIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-386", "path": "/courses/940", "sections": {"path": "/courses/940/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE CONST OF DEMOCRACY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-386-001", "path": "/courses/940/sections/001", "id": "940-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-386-001"]}]}, "id": 940, "aliases": ["PSCI-386"]}
