{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2084"}, "description": "This course will provide an overview of politics and society in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The first five weeks will focus on such questions as: What are the effects of the \"colonial legacy\" inherited by most countries in the \"Third World?\" Why have certain countries been able to maintain stable and effective government institutions while others have experienced revolutions, civil wars and rampant corruption? What are some of the obstacles to economic development? The second part of the course will focus on the experiences of several countries, including Brazil, India, Iran, and Nigeria. The last part of the course will attempt to locate politics and society in \"Third World\"countries within the context of larger global issues such as North-South relations, the recent waves of democratization and privatization, internationalenvironmental concerns, and the role of women in \"Third World\" development. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "POL CHG IN 3RD WRLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25000/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.27", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "3.51", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "POL CHG IN 3RD WRLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-116-001", "path": "/courses/25000/sections/001", "id": "25000-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-116-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 159, "path": "/courses/25000/sections/001/reviews/988-RUDRA-SIL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/988-RUDRA-SIL", "first_name": "RUDRA", "last_name": "SIL", "id": "988-RUDRA-SIL", "name": "RUDRA SIL"}, "num_reviewers": 140, "id": "25000-001-988-RUDRA-SIL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-116", "path": "/courses/25000", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25000/sections", "values": [{"name": "POL CHG IN 3RD WRLD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-116-001", "path": "/courses/25000/sections/001", "id": "25000-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-116-001"]}]}, "id": 25000, "aliases": ["PSCI-116"]}
