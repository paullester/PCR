It is an interdisciplinary seminar with the participation of faculty from around the university. The primary assignments will be data analyses and written reports on research done both individually and in research groups. Students will be taught to use appropriate software programs. The results of the seminar will be disseminated to faculty/student seminars in other countries that are collaborating in a global rsearch program on Universities as Sites of Citizenship. This research program is also involved with the Council of Europe and has collected pilot data in Australia, Korea, and South Africa as well as 15 university sites in Council of Europe countries and in the United State. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "CITIZENSHIP/DEMOCRAT DEV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17969/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.29", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.14", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.57", "rCommAbility": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "CITIZENSHIP/DEMOCRAT DEV", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSCI-291-301", "path": "/courses/17969/sections/301", "id": "17969-301", "aliases": ["PSCI-291-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/17969/sections/301/reviews/989-HENRY-J-TEUNE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/989-HENRY-J-TEUNE", "first_name": "HENRY J", "last_name": "TEUNE", "id": "989-HENRY-J-TEUNE", "name": "HENRY J TEUNE"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "17969-301-989-HENRY-J-TEUNE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-291", "path": "/courses/17969", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17969/sections", "values": [{"name": "CITIZENSHIP/DEMOCRAT DEV", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "PSCI-291-301", "path": "/courses/17969/sections/301", "id": "17969-301", "aliases": ["PSCI-291-301"]}]}, "id": 17969, "aliases": ["PSCI-291"]}
