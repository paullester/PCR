Many also noted its resemblance to Introduction to American Political Thought. Multiple other students, however, described the class as \u201cgreat.\u201d Opinions on the course were mixed.   \r\n\r\nStudents agreed for the most part that Professor Lapinski was very knowledgeable. A majority of students commented on how quickly he delivered his lectures. A few students labeled his lectures as \u201cdry\u201d and felt that his PowerPoint presentations were a little sparse. One student commented on his insertion of his personal politics into lectures.\r\n\r\nPPE considers this class an intermediate course. Some students felt that the readings were either too long or too dense.  There is no final, which led one student to remark that the class felt over two thirds of the way through the semester.  \r\n", "num_students": 115, "path": "/courses/24992/sections/401/reviews/4082-JOHN-S--LAPINSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4082-JOHN-S--LAPINSKI", "first_name": "JOHN S.", "last_name": "LAPINSKI", "id": "4082-JOHN-S--LAPINSKI", "name": "JOHN S.
