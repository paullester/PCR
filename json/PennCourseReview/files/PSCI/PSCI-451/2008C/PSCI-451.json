{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4753"}, "description": "This course provides an introduction to non-cooperative game theory and its applications to political science. The goal of the course is to provide students with the background and understanding necessary to read published game-theoretic work in political science journals. To that end, the course covers the basic concepts of game theory, including Nash equilibrium and its main refinements, simultaneous and sequential games, repeated games, evolutionary game theory, and games of incomplete and private information. In addition, we will cover some of the central models used in political science, notably models of public choice (such as the median voter theorem) and models of bargaining. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "GAME THEORY AND PSCI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19218/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.56", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.90", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.70", "rCommAbility": "2.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "GAME THEORY AND PSCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-451-001", "path": "/courses/19218/sections/001", "id": "19218-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-451-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/19218/sections/001/reviews/4540-ALEX-WEISIGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4540-ALEX-WEISIGER", "first_name": "ALEX", "last_name": "WEISIGER", "id": "4540-ALEX-WEISIGER", "name": "ALEX WEISIGER"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "19218-001-4540-ALEX-WEISIGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-451", "path": "/courses/19218", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19218/sections", "values": [{"name": "GAME THEORY AND PSCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-451-001", "path": "/courses/19218/sections/001", "id": "19218-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-451-001"]}]}, "id": 19218, "aliases": ["PSCI-451"]}
