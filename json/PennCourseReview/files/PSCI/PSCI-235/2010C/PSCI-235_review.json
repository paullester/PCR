You are expected to take charge of your learning, engaging with each other and the instructor in a process of knowledge creation through practice, inquiry, deliberation, criticism, and problem solving. You will produce three pieces of analytical writing. These are complementary and cumulative assignments that, combined, will enhance your understanding of the nature, purpose, and future of U.S. hegemony or global dominance. This is the issue, arguably, at the core of debate today about US foreign policy or grand strategy. \r\n\r\nThe class reads the \u201cfive most recent books on American Foreign Policy,\u201d a choice which one student calls a \u201cstroke of genius.\u201d One of the major assignments includes writing book reviews. Students were generally pleased with the course, describing it as \u201cinteresting\u201d and one of the \u201cbest [courses] I have taken at Penn.\u201d One student remarked that his \u201cfavorite part of class was the material\u201d and it consisted of books that he \u201cwould read on [his] own.\u201d Other students were enthused by the opportunity to discuss and debate \u201ccontroversial issues.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students raved about Professor Vitalis\u2019 \u201cunconventional teaching style\u201d which \u201cchallenges you\u201d to \u201cthink in completely new ways.\u201d He is described as a \u201cdynamic\u201d and \u201cenergetic\u201d speaker, as well as being noted for contributing a sense of humor to the class. One student did complain that he brought a \u201cliberal/progressive agenda\u201d to his teaching; though others remarked that he was able to bring up controversial issues without \u201cimposing or even hinting at his own views.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents claimed that there was \u201clots of reading\u201d and that the \u201cmethod of evaluation \u2013 series of critical book reviews\u201d was valuable and enjoyable. The course has no official prerequisites, but it is recommended that a student has taken either PSCI 130 (American Foreign Policy) or PSCI 150 (Introduction to International Relations).\r\n", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/23673/sections/001/reviews/1014-ROBERT-VITALIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1014-ROBERT-VITALIS", "first_name": "ROBERT", "last_name": "VITALIS", "id": "1014-ROBERT-VITALIS", "name": "ROBERT VITALIS"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "23673-001-1014-ROBERT-VITALIS"}]
