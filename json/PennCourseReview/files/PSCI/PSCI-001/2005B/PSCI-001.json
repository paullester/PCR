{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/915"}, "description": "What does politics mean and how does it work? \n\nThis course introduces fundamental political questions, including the nature of political authority and political rights, the relationship between power and values, variation in the role and quality of government, origins of political institutions, and dynamics of international politics. Substantial consideration is given to contributions by classical political thinkers as well as contemporary political scientists. Attention is also paid to how the systematic study of politics--American politics, comparative politics, international politics, and political philosophy--can deepen our understanding of complex public policy questions. \n\n", "semester": "2005B", "name": "INTRO TO STUDY OF POL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11304/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.26", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.95", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "3.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.16", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO STUDY OF POL", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "PSCI-001-920", "path": "/courses/11304/sections/920", "id": "11304-920", "aliases": ["PSCI-001-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/11304/sections/920/reviews/1941-AMAL-A-JAMAL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1941-AMAL-A-JAMAL", "first_name": "AMAL A", "last_name": "JAMAL", "id": "1941-AMAL-A-JAMAL", "name": "AMAL A JAMAL"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "11304-920-1941-AMAL-A-JAMAL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-001", "path": "/courses/11304", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11304/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO STUDY OF POL", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "PSCI-001-920", "path": "/courses/11304/sections/920", "id": "11304-920", "aliases": ["PSCI-001-920"]}]}, "id": 11304, "aliases": ["PSCI-001"]}
