{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4967"}, "description": "This course is designed as a continuation of beginning Gujarati. The course objectives are to expand the mastery of sentence patterns and augment vocabulary and its usage through intensive grammar and comprehension exercises. A special emphasis will be placed on greater cultural awareness. Upon completion of this course students should be able to interact socially with added confidence and greater expressiveness. Students should also experience a great improvement in their comprehension of spoken and written language. During the second year of Gujarati, students are introduced to progressively more difficult reading selections, along with additional instructions in the formal grammar of the language. To maintain and develop oral and aural command of the language, readings are discussed in Gujarati. To develop their writing abilities, students are also expected to compose short essays on their readings. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE GUJARATI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24511/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "4.00", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "3.50", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "0.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "4.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE GUJARATI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GUJR-422-001", "path": "/courses/24511/sections/001", "id": "24511-001", "aliases": ["GUJR-422-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/24511/sections/001/reviews/1075-BABUBHAI-K--SUTHAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1075-BABUBHAI-K--SUTHAR", "first_name": "BABUBHAI K.", "last_name": "SUTHAR", "id": "1075-BABUBHAI-K--SUTHAR", "name": "BABUBHAI K.
