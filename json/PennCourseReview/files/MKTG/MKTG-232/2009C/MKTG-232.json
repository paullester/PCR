{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4616"}, "description": "The development of new products (goods or services) is an intensively cross-functional process. This course examines that process from the marketing perspective and identifies the key points of contact with operations, finance, organizational policy, and strategic planning. Although an overview of the entire process is provided in the course, special emphasis is placed on the evaluation of concepts early in the process. Thus, this course is very much concerned with ideas and how to select the best ideas and make them a reality. The main objectives of the course are (1) to familiarize students with the strategies, frameworks, conceptual tools, and types of marketing research that are considered best practices in the development of new products and (2) to give students the opportunity to apply these ideas and methods in the evaluation of a specific product concept, customizing the learning experience to their own needs and interests. \n\nMKTG 232 is an expanded version of the mini-course on this topic (MKTG 221). The added time allows for (1) increased depth for the topics normally covered in MKTG 221 (especially in the area of marketing research methods for NPD), (2) the addition of more topics (such as social implications of innovation and new product portfolio management), (3) increased depth for the term project, and (4) guest speakers. It is recommended for students who are considering careers (1) in product management, (2) that involve the evaluation of new products and the ability of companies to produce successful new products, or (3) that focus on developing scientific or artistic ideas in to commercially viable goods and services. Also, the course will meet once a week for 3 hours. Typically, there are two sessions with a break in the middle. One session is lecture; one session is discussion or an in-class event (e.g., guest speaker, simulation game, student presentations, etc.) \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17722/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.11", "rDifficulty": "2.39", "rStimulateInterest": "2.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "1.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.78", "rCommAbility": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MKTG-232-301", "path": "/courses/17722/sections/301", "id": "17722-301", "aliases": ["MKTG-232-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/17722/sections/301/reviews/828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON", "first_name": "JOHN W", "last_name": "HUTCHINSON", "id": "828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON", "name": "JOHN W HUTCHINSON"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "17722-301-828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-232", "path": "/courses/17722", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17722/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MKTG-232-301", "path": "/courses/17722/sections/301", "id": "17722-301", "aliases": ["MKTG-232-301"]}]}, "id": 17722, "aliases": ["MKTG-232"]}
