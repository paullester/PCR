{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/767"}, "description": "The effect of the Internet and related technologies on business and social institutions is more profound than that of any prior invention, including the printing press and the internal combustion engine. Furthermore, marketing plays a key role in shaping the modern consumption-led economies fueled by these technologies. MKTG 227 provides a research-based and framework-driven approach to understanding digital marketing and electronic commerce. \n\nThe course is organized around three sections and utilizes relevant theory, empirical analysis, and practical examples to develop the key learning points. Guests from the entrepreneur and investor communities participate, as appropriate. Part I presents the behavioral foundations for understanding electronic commerce, and covers the relevant phenomena and theory from economics, marketing, and related fields. Part II examines ecommerce business models and institutions including Internet retail, subscription commerce, curated commerce, and so on. Part III focuses on how digital marketing fosters ecommerce business growth. In particular, we survey, critique, and evaluate common digital marketing methods and tactics. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "MKTG AND ELECTRONIC COMM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4424/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rStimulateInterest": "3.59", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.35", "rWorkRequired": "2.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.94", "rCommAbility": "3.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "MKTG AND ELECTRONIC COMM", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-227-002", "path": "/courses/4424/sections/002", "id": "4424-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-227-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/4424/sections/002/reviews/1617-PATTI-WILLIAMS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1617-PATTI-WILLIAMS", "first_name": "PATTI", "last_name": "WILLIAMS", "id": "1617-PATTI-WILLIAMS", "name": "PATTI WILLIAMS"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "4424-002-1617-PATTI-WILLIAMS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-227", "path": "/courses/4424", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4424/sections", "values": [{"name": "MKTG AND ELECTRONIC COMM", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-227-002", "path": "/courses/4424/sections/002", "id": "4424-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-227-002"]}]}, "id": 4424, "aliases": ["MKTG-227"]}
