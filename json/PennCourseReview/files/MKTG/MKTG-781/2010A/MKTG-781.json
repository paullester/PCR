{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4999"}, "description": "This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular, it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan), as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design, assessment of market potential, creation of successful distribution relationships, and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course, the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research, successful strategic alternatives for small business, alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g., direct marketing, alternative media and personal selling), segmentation, and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice, possibly for a new venture they are considering. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26432/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.67", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "1.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.56", "rCourseQuality": "1.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "1.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "1.67", "rInstructorQuality": "1.50"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "MKTG-781-751", "path": "/courses/26432/sections/751", "id": "26432-751", "aliases": ["MKTG-781-751"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/26432/sections/751/reviews/5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH", "first_name": "LEONARD M", "last_name": "LODISH", "id": "5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH", "name": "LEONARD M LODISH"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "26432-751-5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-781", "path": "/courses/26432", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26432/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "MKTG-781-751", "path": "/courses/26432/sections/751", "id": "26432-751", "aliases": ["MKTG-781-751"]}]}, "id": 26432, "aliases": ["MKTG-781"]}
