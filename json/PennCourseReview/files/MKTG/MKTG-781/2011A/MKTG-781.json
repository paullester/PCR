{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4999"}, "description": "This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular, it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan), as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design, assessment of market potential, creation of successful distribution relationships, and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course, the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research, successful strategic alternatives for small business, alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g., direct marketing, alternative media and personal selling), segmentation, and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice, possibly for a new venture they are considering. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22093/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.82", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.76", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "MKTG-781-751", "path": "/courses/22093/sections/751", "id": "22093-751", "aliases": ["MKTG-781-751"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/22093/sections/751/reviews/5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH", "first_name": "LEONARD M", "last_name": "LODISH", "id": "5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH", "name": "LEONARD M LODISH"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "22093-751-5439-LEONARD-M-LODISH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-781", "path": "/courses/22093", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22093/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "MKTG-781-751", "path": "/courses/22093/sections/751", "id": "22093-751", "aliases": ["MKTG-781-751"]}]}, "id": 22093, "aliases": ["MKTG-781"]}
