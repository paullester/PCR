{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/769"}, "description": "This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular, it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan), as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design, assessment of market potential, creation of successful distribution relationships, and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course, the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research, successful strategic alternatives for small business, alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g., direct marketing, alternative media, and personal selling) segmentation, and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice, possibly for a new venture they are considering. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16751/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.03", "rDifficulty": "2.12", "rStimulateInterest": "3.03", "rRecommendMajor": "2.91", "rCourseQuality": "3.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "921", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-921", "path": "/courses/16751/sections/921", "id": "16751-921", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-921"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/16751/sections/921/reviews/4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "MADWAY", "id": "4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY", "name": "WILLIAM MADWAY"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "16751-921-4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-281", "path": "/courses/16751", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16751/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "921", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-921", "path": "/courses/16751/sections/921", "id": "16751-921", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-921"]}]}, "id": 16751, "aliases": ["MKTG-281"]}
