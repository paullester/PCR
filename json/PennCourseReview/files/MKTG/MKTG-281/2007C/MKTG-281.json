{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/769"}, "description": "This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular, it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan), as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design, assessment of market potential, creation of successful distribution relationships, and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course, the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research, successful strategic alternatives for small business, alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g., direct marketing, alternative media, and personal selling) segmentation, and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice, possibly for a new venture they are considering. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13586/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "1.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.03", "rWorkRequired": "1.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.66", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-002", "path": "/courses/13586/sections/002", "id": "13586-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/13586/sections/002/reviews/812-C-ANTHONY-DI-BENEDETTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/812-C-ANTHONY-DI-BENEDETTO", "first_name": "C ANTHONY", "last_name": "DI BENEDETTO", "id": "812-C-ANTHONY-DI-BENEDETTO", "name": "C ANTHONY DI BENEDETTO"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "13586-002-812-C-ANTHONY-DI-BENEDETTO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-281", "path": "/courses/13586", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13586/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-002", "path": "/courses/13586/sections/002", "id": "13586-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-002"]}]}, "id": 13586, "aliases": ["MKTG-281"]}
