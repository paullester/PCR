{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/769"}, "description": "This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular, it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan), as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design, assessment of market potential, creation of successful distribution relationships, and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course, the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research, successful strategic alternatives for small business, alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g., direct marketing, alternative media, and personal selling) segmentation, and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice, possibly for a new venture they are considering. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/769/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "1.53", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "1.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-002", "path": "/courses/769/sections/002", "id": "769-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/769/sections/002/reviews/833-GAVAN-FITZSIMONS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/833-GAVAN-FITZSIMONS", "first_name": "GAVAN", "last_name": "FITZSIMONS", "id": "833-GAVAN-FITZSIMONS", "name": "GAVAN FITZSIMONS"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "769-002-833-GAVAN-FITZSIMONS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-281", "path": "/courses/769", "sections": {"path": "/courses/769/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-002", "path": "/courses/769/sections/002", "id": "769-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-002"]}]}, "id": 769, "aliases": ["MKTG-281"]}
