{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/769"}, "description": "This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular, it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan), as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design, assessment of market potential, creation of successful distribution relationships, and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course, the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research, successful strategic alternatives for small business, alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g., direct marketing, alternative media, and personal selling) segmentation, and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice, possibly for a new venture they are considering. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6850/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.22", "rWorkRequired": "1.94", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.12", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "2.28", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-002", "path": "/courses/6850/sections/002", "id": "6850-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/6850/sections/002/reviews/832-CATHERINE-SCHAFFER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/832-CATHERINE-SCHAFFER", "first_name": "CATHERINE", "last_name": "SCHAFFER", "id": "832-CATHERINE-SCHAFFER", "name": "CATHERINE SCHAFFER"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "6850-002-832-CATHERINE-SCHAFFER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-281", "path": "/courses/6850", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6850/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURIAL MKTG", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-281-002", "path": "/courses/6850/sections/002", "id": "6850-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-281-002"]}]}, "id": 6850, "aliases": ["MKTG-281"]}
