This course examines that process from the marketing perspective and identifies the key points of contact with operations, finance, organizational policy, and strategic planning. Thus, this course is very much concerned with ideas and how to select the best ideas and make them a reality. The main objectives of the course are (1) to familiarize students with the strategies, frameworks, conceptual tools, and types of marketing research that are considered best practices in the development of new products and (2) to give students the opportunity to apply some of these ideas and methods in the evaluation of a specific product concept, customizing the learning experience to their own needs and interests. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "NEW PRODUCT MANAGEMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23452/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.92", "rDifficulty": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "1.75", "rRecommendMajor": "1.83", "rCourseQuality": "1.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.58", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.15"}, "section": {"name": "NEW PRODUCT MANAGEMENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-753-001", "path": "/courses/23452/sections/001", "id": "23452-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-753-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/23452/sections/001/reviews/5644-RAVINDRA-CHITTURI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5644-RAVINDRA-CHITTURI", "first_name": "RAVINDRA", "last_name": "CHITTURI", "id": "5644-RAVINDRA-CHITTURI", "name": "RAVINDRA CHITTURI"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "23452-001-5644-RAVINDRA-CHITTURI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-753", "path": "/courses/23452", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23452/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEW PRODUCT MANAGEMENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-753-001", "path": "/courses/23452/sections/001", "id": "23452-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-753-001"]}]}, "id": 23452, "aliases": ["MKTG-753"]}
