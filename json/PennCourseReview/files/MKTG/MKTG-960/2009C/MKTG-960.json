{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4621"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide a solid foundation for critical thinking and research on the judgment, decision-making and choice aspects of consumer behavior. There is a focus on how people process information when making judgments and choices and how the processes of judgment and choice might be improved. Topics of discussion include rationality, judgment under uncertainty, judgment heuristics and biases, risk taking, dealing with conflicting values, framing effects, prospect theory, inter-temporal choice, preference formation, and the psychology of utility. The focus will be on the individual decision-maker, although the topics will also have some applicability to group and organizational decision-making and behavioral research methodologies. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "JDGMNT & DEC MAKING CB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17740/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "2.79", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.93", "rCourseQuality": "3.64", "rWorkRequired": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "JDGMNT & DEC MAKING CB", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MKTG-960-301", "path": "/courses/17740/sections/301", "id": "17740-301", "aliases": ["MKTG-960-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/17740/sections/301/reviews/3391-GAL-ZAUBERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3391-GAL-ZAUBERMAN", "first_name": "GAL", "last_name": "ZAUBERMAN", "id": "3391-GAL-ZAUBERMAN", "name": "GAL ZAUBERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "17740-301-3391-GAL-ZAUBERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-960", "path": "/courses/17740", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17740/sections", "values": [{"name": "JDGMNT & DEC MAKING CB", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MKTG-960-301", "path": "/courses/17740/sections/301", "id": "17740-301", "aliases": ["MKTG-960-301"]}]}, "id": 17740, "aliases": ["MKTG-960"]}
