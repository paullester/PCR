{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5345"}, "description": "This course is designed to generate awareness and appreciation of the way several substantive topics in marketing have been studied empirically using quantitative models. This seminar reviews empirical models of marketing phenomena including consumer choice, adoption of new products, sales response to marketing mix elements, and competitive interaction. Applies methods and concepts developed in econometrics and statistics but focuses on substantive issues of model structure and interpretation, rather than on estimation techniques. Ultimately, the goals are a) to prepare students to read and understand the literature and b) to stimulate new research interests. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with the key issues and approaches in empirical marketing modeling. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "Empirical Models in Marketing", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26437/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "Empirical Models in Marketing", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MKTG-964-301", "path": "/courses/26437/sections/301", "id": "26437-301", "aliases": ["MKTG-964-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/26437/sections/301/reviews/4903-MARIA-ANA-VITORINO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4903-MARIA-ANA-VITORINO", "first_name": "MARIA ANA", "last_name": "VITORINO", "id": "4903-MARIA-ANA-VITORINO", "name": "MARIA ANA VITORINO"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "26437-301-4903-MARIA-ANA-VITORINO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "Empirical Models in Marketing", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MKTG-964-301", "path": "/courses/26437/sections/301", "id": "26437-301", "aliases": ["MKTG-964-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/26437/sections/301/reviews/5810-DAVID-R--BELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5810-DAVID-R--BELL", "first_name": "DAVID R.", "last_name": "BELL", "id": "5810-DAVID-R--BELL", "name": "DAVID R.
