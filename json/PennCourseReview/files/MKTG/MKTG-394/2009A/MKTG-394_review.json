It is highly recommended to both majors and non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/16114/sections/301/reviews/3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "first_name": "SUZANNE E", "last_name": "DIAMOND", "id": "3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "name": "SUZANNE E DIAMOND"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "16114-301-3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND"}]
