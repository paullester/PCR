The course was fast-paced but packed with plenty of real-life knowledge applicable to students\u2019 lives.\r\n\r\nStudents were generally very pleased with Professor Diamond\u2019s seminar-styled lecture. Some described Professor Diamond as \u201cincredibly engaging\u201d to listen to and able to convey course material in a \u201cclear and exciting way.\u201d One thing to note is that Professor Diamond was seldom available in forms apart from email due to her intense traveling schedule.\r\n\r\nSome students thought the grading on cases and especially exams was subjective and not representative of material taught in class. Even though the course was loosely structured by nature of its seminar style, students who found the course material interesting said the three hours always passed by quickly. This class is recommended to majors and non-majors alike.\r\n", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/23445/sections/301/reviews/3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "first_name": "SUZANNE E", "last_name": "DIAMOND", "id": "3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "name": "SUZANNE E DIAMOND"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "23445-301-3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND"}]
