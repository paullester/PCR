{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4617"}, "description": "Technology has created a completely new and ever-changing marketing and media economy. Hundreds of millions of interactive media users have migrated to various digital platforms and spend hours a day engaged in media behaviors that barely existed a short time ago. Hundreds of millions of marketing dollars have followed, usually in search of one-to-one marketing on a global scale. But few standards exist in buying and selling of emerging media, and traditional marketing concepts like ROI and POP are pulled in directions as varied as the platforms. Additionally, with every emerging platform and every new user connection, one critical question persists: how is it monetized? This class will examine the business of emerging platforms and, through case studies, class speakers and real world examples, examine how digital currency is taking control of the business conversation. By the end of this class, students will be expected to answer the monetization question across a variety of emerging media platforms. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MON EMERG INTERACT MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22083/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "0.59", "rDifficulty": "1.37", "rStimulateInterest": "0.50", "rRecommendMajor": "0.41", "rCourseQuality": "0.46", "rWorkRequired": "1.85", "rInstructorAccess": "0.44", "rReadingsValue": "1.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.29", "rCommAbility": "0.54", "rInstructorQuality": "0.29"}, "section": {"name": "MON EMERG INTERACT MEDIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-668-001", "path": "/courses/22083/sections/001", "id": "22083-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-668-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/22083/sections/001/reviews/3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "first_name": "SUZANNE E", "last_name": "DIAMOND", "id": "3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND", "name": "SUZANNE E DIAMOND"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "22083-001-3086-SUZANNE-E-DIAMOND"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-668", "path": "/courses/22083", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22083/sections", "values": [{"name": "MON EMERG INTERACT MEDIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-668-001", "path": "/courses/22083/sections/001", "id": "22083-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-668-001"]}]}, "id": 22083, "aliases": ["MKTG-668"]}
