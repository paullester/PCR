{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5566"}, "description": "Building upon Marketing 611, the goal of this course is to develop skills in formulating and implementing marketing strategies for brands and businesses. The course will focus on issues such as the selection of which businesses and segments to compete in, how to allocate resources across businesses, segments, and elements of the marketing mix, as well as other significant strategic issues facing today's managers in a dynamic competitive environment. \n\nA central theme of the course is that the answer to these strategic problems varies over time depending on the stage of the product life cycle at which marketing decisions are being made. As such, the PLC serves as the central organizing vehicle of the course. We will explore such issues as how to design optimal strategies for the launch of new products and services that arise during the introductory phase, how to maximize the acceleration of revenue during the growth phase, how to sustain and extend profitability during the mature phase, and how to manage a business during the inevitable decline phase. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DYNAMIC MKTG STRATEGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29314/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.82", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.59", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.59", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "DYNAMIC MKTG STRATEGY", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-612-002", "path": "/courses/29314/sections/002", "id": "29314-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-612-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/29314/sections/002/reviews/6343-DAVID-J--REIBSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6343-DAVID-J--REIBSTEIN", "first_name": "DAVID J.", "last_name": "REIBSTEIN", "id": "6343-DAVID-J--REIBSTEIN", "name": "DAVID J.
