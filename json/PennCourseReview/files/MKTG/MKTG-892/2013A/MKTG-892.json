The course includes: (1) Interaction with creative guest lecturers from diverse fields; (2) A review of the literature on creativity, creative people, innovation, and design as well as the leadership and management of creative people and innovation; (3) Hands on learning of approaches for generating creative new products/services and business ideas; and (4) Applications of creativity tools to selected management domains. Approaches to the generation of creative options are not limited to the development of products and services or businesses, but can be applied to all areas of management, business, and life. The purpose of these sessions is to explore the applications of creative approaches to marketing, advertising, cost reduction efforts, M&A and strategic alliances, organizational design, and management challenges. Given the current global financial crisis and economic recession, much of the applications are going to focus on what corporations (and public policy decision makers) should do to creatively address their challenges. \n\n(5) Integration - Both via individual assignments and a group project in which interdisciplinary teams of students generate a creative project/ service/ business/ strategy. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "CREATIVITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30670/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.30", "rDifficulty": "1.59", "rTAQuality": "1.15", "rStimulateInterest": "1.14", "rRecommendMajor": "1.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "2.59", "rReadingsValue": "1.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.83", "rCommAbility": "1.41", "rInstructorQuality": "1.42"}, "section": {"name": "CREATIVITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-892-001", "path": "/courses/30670/sections/001", "id": "30670-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-892-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/30670/sections/001/reviews/4454-YORAM--JERRY--WIND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4454-YORAM--JERRY--WIND", "first_name": "YORAM (JERRY)", "last_name": "WIND", "id": "4454-YORAM--JERRY--WIND", "name": "YORAM (JERRY) WIND"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "30670-001-4454-YORAM--JERRY--WIND"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-892", "path": "/courses/30670", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30670/sections", "values": [{"name": "CREATIVITY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-892-001", "path": "/courses/30670/sections/001", "id": "30670-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-892-001"]}]}, "id": 30670, "aliases": ["MKTG-892"]}
