{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4997"}, "description": "This course will expose students to the theoretical and empirical \"building blocks\" that will allow them to construct, estimate, and interpret powerful models of consumer behavior. Over the years, researchers and practitioners have used these models for a wide variety of applications, such as new product sales, forecasting, analyses of media usage, and targeted marketing programs. Other disciplines have seen equally broad utilization of these techniques. The course will be entirely lecture-based with a strong emphasis on real-time problem solving. Most sessions will feature sophisticated numerical investigations using Microsoft Excel. Much of the material is highly technical. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "APPL PROB MODELS MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22081/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.76", "rDifficulty": "3.41", "rStimulateInterest": "3.82", "rRecommendMajor": "3.91", "rCourseQuality": "3.70", "rWorkRequired": "3.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "APPL PROB MODELS MKTG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MKTG-476-401", "path": "/courses/22081/sections/401", "id": "22081-401", "aliases": ["MKTG-476-401", "STAT-476-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/22081/sections/401/reviews/2566-PETER-S-FADER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2566-PETER-S-FADER", "first_name": "PETER S", "last_name": "FADER", "id": "2566-PETER-S-FADER", "name": "PETER S FADER"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "22081-401-2566-PETER-S-FADER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-476", "path": "/courses/22081", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22081/sections", "values": [{"name": "APPL PROB MODELS MKTG", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MKTG-476-401", "path": "/courses/22081/sections/401", "id": "22081-401", "aliases": ["MKTG-476-401", "STAT-476-401"]}]}, "id": 22081, "aliases": ["MKTG-476", "STAT-476"]}
