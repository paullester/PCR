One student pointed out that the material was very \u201ctheoretical,\u201d and would have appreciated more \u201capplications of models.\u201d\r\nReviews for Professor Fader were very positive. Professor Fader was described as \u201csimply excellent\u201d and \u201cat the top of the field with what he does.\u201d \u201cHe challenges students to try their hand in developing their own models, frameworks, and unique applications.\u201d One student did mention that he enjoyed the \u201cwit and sarcasm\u201d Professor Fader employed in class but would have appreciated more guidance on why a certain idea is \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d\r\nMKTG 476 is an elective course that is cross listed in the Statistics department.
