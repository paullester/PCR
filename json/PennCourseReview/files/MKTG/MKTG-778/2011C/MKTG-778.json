Broadly, the course will be divided into four parts: 1) Understanding Brand, 2) Crafting Brand, 3) Measuring Brand, and 4) Managing Brand. The course will provide students with an appreciation of the role of branding and (taking a consumer-centric approach) will augment students' ability to think creatively and critically about the strategies and tactics involved in building, leveraging, defending, and sustaining inspired brands. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24790/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.15", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "2.77", "rRecommendMajor": "2.46", "rCourseQuality": "2.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "2.85", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.92", "rCommAbility": "2.54", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-701", "path": "/courses/24790/sections/701", "id": "24790-701", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-701"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/24790/sections/701/reviews/814-BARBARA-E-KAHN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/814-BARBARA-E-KAHN", "first_name": "BARBARA E", "last_name": "KAHN", "id": "814-BARBARA-E-KAHN", "name": "BARBARA E KAHN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "24790-701-814-BARBARA-E-KAHN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-778", "path": "/courses/24790", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24790/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-701", "path": "/courses/24790/sections/701", "id": "24790-701", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-701"]}]}, "id": 24790, "aliases": ["MKTG-778"]}
