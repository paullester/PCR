This course explores such questions with the goal of identifying the ingredients for building an inspired brand, where brand is defined as \"a sensibility \" - departing from traditional perspectives of brand. The course is created for students interested in building their own brands and/or immersing themselves in the enhancement of an existing brand, and it is comprised of lectures, cases, guest speakers, discussions, in and out of class exercises, all of which culminate in a brand audit group project that students will present in the final class session. Broadly, the course will be divided into four parts: 1) Understanding Brand, 2) Crafting Brand, 3) Measuring Brand, and 4) Managing Brand. The course will provide students with an appreciation of the role of branding and (taking a consumer-centric approach) will augment students' ability to think creatively and critically about the strategies and tactics involved in building, leveraging, defending, and sustaining inspired brands. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22092/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.48", "rDifficulty": "1.55", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.48", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.04", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-001", "path": "/courses/22092/sections/001", "id": "22092-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/22092/sections/001/reviews/5434-CASSIE-MOGILNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5434-CASSIE-MOGILNER", "first_name": "CASSIE", "last_name": "MOGILNER", "id": "5434-CASSIE-MOGILNER", "name": "CASSIE MOGILNER"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "22092-001-5434-CASSIE-MOGILNER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-778", "path": "/courses/22092", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22092/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-001", "path": "/courses/22092/sections/001", "id": "22092-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-001"]}]}, "id": 22092, "aliases": ["MKTG-778"]}
