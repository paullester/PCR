How do companies create compelling brand experiences? How could you cultivate a brand that makes consumers happy? well-loved brand? This course explores such questions with the goal of identifying the ingredients for building an inspired brand, where brand is defined as \"a sensibility\" - departing from traditional perspectives of brand. The course is created for students interested in building their own brands and/or immersing themselves in the enhancement of an existing brand, and it is comprised of lectures, cases, guest speakers, discussions, in and out of class exercises, all of which culminate in a brand audit group project that students will present in the final class session. Broadly, the course will be divided into four parts: 1) Understanding Brand, 2) Crafting Brand, 3) Measuring Brand, and 4) Managing Brand. The course will provide students with an appreciation of the role of branding and (taking a consumer-centric approach) will augment students' ability to think creatively and critically about the strategies and tactics involved in building, leveraging, defending, and sustaining inspired brands. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30669/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.94", "rDifficulty": "1.76", "rTAQuality": "1.69", "rStimulateInterest": "1.65", "rRecommendMajor": "2.30", "rCourseQuality": "1.90", "rWorkRequired": "2.03", "rInstructorAccess": "2.59", "rReadingsValue": "1.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.38", "rCommAbility": "2.16", "rInstructorQuality": "1.95"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-401", "path": "/courses/30669/sections/401", "id": "30669-401", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-401", "MKTG-278-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 50, "path": "/courses/30669/sections/401/reviews/6529-ASHISH-SOOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6529-ASHISH-SOOD", "first_name": "ASHISH", "last_name": "SOOD", "id": "6529-ASHISH-SOOD", "name": "ASHISH SOOD"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "30669-401-6529-ASHISH-SOOD"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.09", "rDifficulty": "1.82", "rTAQuality": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "2.48", "rCourseQuality": "2.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.39", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.61", "rInstructorQuality": "2.59"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-402", "path": "/courses/30669/sections/402", "id": "30669-402", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-402", "MKTG-278-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/30669/sections/402/reviews/6529-ASHISH-SOOD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6529-ASHISH-SOOD", "first_name": "ASHISH", "last_name": "SOOD", "id": "6529-ASHISH-SOOD", "name": "ASHISH SOOD"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "30669-402-6529-ASHISH-SOOD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-778", "path": "/courses/30669", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30669/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-401", "path": "/courses/30669/sections/401", "id": "30669-401", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-401", "MKTG-278-401"]}, {"name": "STRATEGIC BRAND MGMT", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "MKTG-778-402", "path": "/courses/30669/sections/402", "id": "30669-402", "aliases": ["MKTG-778-402", "MKTG-278-402"]}]}, "id": 30669, "aliases": ["MKTG-778", "MKTG-278"]}
