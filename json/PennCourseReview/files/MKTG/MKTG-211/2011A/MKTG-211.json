Marketing, in particular, begins and ends with the consumer \u2013 from determining his or her needs to ensuring post-purchase satisfaction. The primary goal of this course is to enhance understanding of consumer behavior. By the end of the course students will be knowledgeable about consumer psychology and ways of better meeting people\u2019s needs. During this process, students will come to better understand themselves as a target of marketing influence. Students will also appreciate how an understanding of consumer psychology can be used to develop powerful marketing techniques and tactics. The course also aims to provide an important competitive advantage: an ability to see how to have an impact on consumers, and hence a talent for making more insightful business decisions. This course is an examination of the factors (both internal and external) that influence people's behavior in a buying situation. Course objectives are: (1) to provide conceptual understanding of consumer behavior, integrating theories from psychology, sociology, and economics; (2) to provide experience in the application of buyer behavior concepts to marketing management decisions; and (3) to introduce behavioral research approaches. Marketing 101 is a prerequisite. &#8232;&#8232;Overall, students enjoyed this course and the subject material. Most students agreed that this course had a \u201cheavy slant on psychology\u201d but that Professor Mellers \u201cknows her stuff on that end\u201d and made sure the material was clear to everyone. Students further remarked that the course actually combined \u201cmarketing and psychology in a way that is thought-provoking and applicable to the real world.\u201d Students also enjoyed the guest lecturers for the course. &#8232;&#8232;Students overall felt that Professor Mellers is \u201cknowledgeable, engaging, and approachable.\u201d Students commented that Professor Mellers truly \u201cwants everyone to learn and do well\u201d. Professor Mellers expressed an \u201cIncredible amount of expertise\u201d that she was able to share in an engaging, fun, and interesting way. &#8232;&#8232;Students agreed that the grading for the course \u201cwas a lot tougher than expected\u201d and sometimes seemed \u201crandom\u201d. However, several students commented that Professor Mellers \u201cis more than willing to sit down and discuss grades\u201d in order to help. The group project for the course elicited mixed reviews, with some students finding it \u201cchallenging\u201d and exciting, and others seeing less value in it.", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/22068/sections/003/reviews/5432-BARBARA-A--MELLERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5432-BARBARA-A--MELLERS", "first_name": "BARBARA A.", "last_name": "MELLERS", "id": "5432-BARBARA-A--MELLERS", "name": "BARBARA A.
