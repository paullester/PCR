Its goals are to: (1) provide conceptual understanding of consumer behavior, (2) provide experience in the application of buyer behavior concepts to marketing management decisions and social policy decision-making; and (3) to develop analytical capability in using behavioral research.\r\n\r\nMost students agreed that this was a \u201cfantastic course\u201d that provides \u201creal world experience to the student and the learning process which is felt throughout the project.\u201d Students loved that they got to \u201cengage in real world experience\u201d although one student stressed \u201ca lot of guest lecturers and so I feel I have become more familiar with specific companies than actual marketing tactics.\u201d Many students found that the topics were interesting and the lab days were the \u201cmost useful part of the class.\u201d Students liked that this course \u201cuses a real-life Windows project\u201d due to a Windows Phone/Microsoft partnership\u201d which was \u201cextremely valuable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tThe majority of students loved Professor Reed, deeming him as \u201cone of the most engaging Professors\u201d they had ever met. Students liked that classes were \u201cnot a lecture but more of a lecture/discussion\u201d where Professor Reed was \u201cgreat at keeping interest during the class.\u201d Students though he was \u201cengaging, energetic and exciting.\u201d Many students liked that there were \u201ccorporate guest speakers discussing topics that are highly relevant to recently learned material.\u201d However, some students found that Professor Reed was \u201cnot great at responding to emails\u201d and was \u201chard to reach outside of class.\u201d One student also said that he \u201csometimes communicated different things on the deliberables. It wasn\u2019t always clear what exactly we needed to turn in, when things were due, where documents were placed, etc.\u201d\r\n\t\r\nMany students were frustrated by the lack of exams or tests. One student stated \u201cthe entire grade is placed upon one assignment at the end. It is a little unclear what the expectations are.\u201d Other students commented that they were required to \u201cpurchase a coursepack of slides that were 75% complete (that we had to fill in)\u201d, and that students were required to spend money on the final project. However, students thought the final project was \u201ca lot of fun, especially because we were helping a real company\u201d. Students liked the goal of this project, which was \u201cto come up with a segment and target the segment with certain advertising strategies\u201d. Students stressed that there was a \u201clack of required coursework\u201d although a lot of \u201cwork outside of class\u201d. One student also complained that participation was evaluated through the Canvas site, and that they did not want to \u201chave to worry about posting on the Canvas site for participation points\u201d. The prerequisite for this course is MKTG 101, and is open to all SEAS and Wharton students.  \r\n", "num_students": 70, "path": "/courses/27785/sections/001/reviews/825-AMERICUS-REED", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/825-AMERICUS-REED", "first_name": "AMERICUS", "last_name": "REED", "id": "825-AMERICUS-REED", "name": "AMERICUS REED"}, "num_reviewers": 61, "id": "27785-001-825-AMERICUS-REED"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "1.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.03", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.04", "rReadingsValue": "2.49", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "CONSUMER BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-211-002", "path": "/courses/27785/sections/002", "id": "27785-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-211-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/27785/sections/002/reviews/825-AMERICUS-REED", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/825-AMERICUS-REED", "first_name": "AMERICUS", "last_name": "REED", "id": "825-AMERICUS-REED", "name": "AMERICUS REED"}, "num_reviewers": 62, "id": "27785-002-825-AMERICUS-REED"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-211", "path": "/courses/27785", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27785/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONSUMER BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-211-001", "path": "/courses/27785/sections/001", "id": "27785-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-211-001"]}, {"name": "CONSUMER BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-211-002", "path": "/courses/27785/sections/002", "id": "27785-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-211-002"]}]}, "id": 27785, "aliases": ["MKTG-211"]}
