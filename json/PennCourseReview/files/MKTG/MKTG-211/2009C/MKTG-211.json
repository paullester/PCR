Course objectives are: to provide conceptual understanding of consumer behavior, integrating theories from psychology, sociology, and economics; to provide experience in the application of buyer behavior concepts to marketing management decisions; and to introduce behavioral research approaches.\r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed the guest lectures, but suggested that they be made optional as they are held outside of class time. One student wrote that the material is taught \u201cin a way that is more applicable to the changing times. I like that the Professor would email us weekly with relevant articles that made us further understand the material.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students agree that Professor Berger is a good professor. Nevertheless, they also feel that Professor Berger was unnecessarily strict when it came to timeliness. Students also disagreed with Professor Berger\u2019s policy not to hold office hours or provide help outside of class, wishing that he had made himself more accessible.\r\n\r\nThis course comes highly recommended. However, several students warn that grading can sometimes seem \u201carbitrary.\u201d One warns that it is very participation heavy and thus difficult for less outspoken students. \r\n", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/17716/sections/004/reviews/4902-JONAH-A--BERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4902-JONAH-A--BERGER", "first_name": "JONAH A.", "last_name": "BERGER", "id": "4902-JONAH-A--BERGER", "name": "JONAH A.
