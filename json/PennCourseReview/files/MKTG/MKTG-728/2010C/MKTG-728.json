{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4618"}, "description": "Why do some products catch on and achieve huge popularity while others fail? Why do some behaviors spread like wildfire while others languish? How do certain ideas seem to stick in memory while others disappear the minute you hear them? More broadly, what factors lead to trends, social contagion, and social epidemics? \n\nInteractive media, word of mouth, and viral marketing are important issues for companies, brands, and organizations. This course looks at these and other topics as it examines how products, ideas, and behaviors catch on and become popular. Marketers want their product to be popular, organizations want their social change initiative to catch on and entrepreneurs want their ideas to stick. This course will touch on four main aspects: (1) Characteristics of products, ideas, and behaviors that lead them to be successful. (2) Aspects of individual psychology that influence what things are successful. (3) Interpersonal processes, or how interactions between individuals drive success. (4) Social networks, or how patterns of social ties influence success. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "CONTAGIOUS: How Products, Ideas, and Behaviors Catch On", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23451/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.08", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.54", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.19", "rInstructorQuality": "2.87"}, "section": {"name": "CONTAGIOUS: How Products, Ideas, and Behaviors Catch On", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-728-001", "path": "/courses/23451/sections/001", "id": "23451-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-728-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/23451/sections/001/reviews/4902-JONAH-A--BERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4902-JONAH-A--BERGER", "first_name": "JONAH A.", "last_name": "BERGER", "id": "4902-JONAH-A--BERGER", "name": "JONAH A.
