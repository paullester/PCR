Of particular interest are the actions that are central to the main products and services delivered by the firm, such as the development of products and brands, pricing, advertising, and distribution. The course is structured around four problem areas: impact on health and well-being (physical and mental), impact on the environment, impact on culture (including innovation and creativity), and impact on poverty and economic development. \r\n\r\nMost students enjoyed this course and thought it provided \u201creally interesting concepts.\u201d Students also said that discussions were engaging and \u201cstimulated thinking and reexamining of the criteria for which we look at impacts of business and marketing actions in society.\u201d Some thought that lectures could offer \u201cmore robust frameworks for guiding our evaluation of social impact.\u201d \r\n\r\nGenerally students thought Professor Hutchinson did a \u201cgreat job in shaping the course material around the cases, readings, and external speakers, all of which were relevant and added to the amount learned.\u201d Some felt though that the professor made it \u201cvery obvious that she believed there is a \u2018right\u2019 answer.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe course meets twice a week. Typically, one session is lecture and/or a case, and one session is an in-class event, such as a guest speaker, student presentations, or simulation game. The main deliverables for the course are two position papers and a final short essay evaluating the social impact of companies or products in a specific industry. Students enjoyed the position papers and presentations in this course because it gave them the opportunity to collaborate with other members of the class. Some mentioned that it covers a lot of material for a half-credit course.", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/26416/sections/001/reviews/828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON", "first_name": "JOHN W", "last_name": "HUTCHINSON", "id": "828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON", "name": "JOHN W HUTCHINSON"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "26416-001-828-JOHN-W-HUTCHINSON"}]
