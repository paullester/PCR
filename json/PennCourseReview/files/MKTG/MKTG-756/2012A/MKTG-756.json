{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4344"}, "description": "The objective of the course is to provide a rigorous experience in marketing research methods. The course is aimed at the manager, who is the ultimate user of the research and is responsible for determining the major scope and direction of research activities. Techniques of data collection, evaluation of alternative sources of information, and methods of evaluating data and presenting the results are covered. The course should help managers recognize the role of systematic information gathering and analysis in making marketing decisions. The course also deals with how to define information needs; the use of test marketing procedures; forms of analysis applicable to marketing research information; and the role of models in decision making. \n\nInactive \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "MARKETING RESEARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27802/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.35", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.59", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "1.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "MARKETING RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-756-001", "path": "/courses/27802/sections/001", "id": "27802-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-756-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/27802/sections/001/reviews/4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR", "first_name": "RAGHURAM", "last_name": "IYENGAR", "id": "4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR", "name": "RAGHURAM IYENGAR"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "27802-001-4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.41", "rRecommendMajor": "3.51", "rCourseQuality": "3.22", "rWorkRequired": "2.59", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.54"}, "section": {"name": "MARKETING RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-756-002", "path": "/courses/27802/sections/002", "id": "27802-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-756-002"]}, "comments": "MKTG 756 provides a rigorous experience in marketing research methods, covering techniques of data collection, evaluation of alternative sources of information, and methods of evaluating data and presenting the results.

The course also deals with how to define information needs, the use of test marketing procedures, forms of analysis applicable to marketing research information and the role of models in decision making.\r\n\r\nOverall, students did not enjoy the course very much. One student described it as being too \"micro,\" focusing too much on how to run the research rather than on interpreting the results and assessing the quality of the assessments. Students would like to see more \"case studies and practical applications \"rather than \"statistical theory.\" Another student criticized the large group sizes and large assignments, suggesting that smaller groups and assignments would be more conductive to learning.\r\n\r\nThe students had high praises for Professor Iyengar, commending his ability to \"stimulate student interest.\" According to one student, \"Professor Iyengar is a fantastic professor who is committed to student's learning and makes a dry subject interesting.\" Another student described him as \"one of the most memorable professors during my time at Wharton.\"\r\n\r\nStudents were not decided on whether majors should take the class. According to one student, \"the content of the course is not distinct enough from other classes to justify making it a requirement for marketing majors.\"\r\n", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/27802/sections/002/reviews/4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR", "first_name": "RAGHURAM", "last_name": "IYENGAR", "id": "4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR", "name": "RAGHURAM IYENGAR"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "27802-002-4196-RAGHURAM-IYENGAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-756", "path": "/courses/27802", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27802/sections", "values": [{"name": "MARKETING RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-756-001", "path": "/courses/27802/sections/001", "id": "27802-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-756-001"]}, {"name": "MARKETING RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MKTG-756-002", "path": "/courses/27802/sections/002", "id": "27802-002", "aliases": ["MKTG-756-002"]}]}, "id": 27802, "aliases": ["MKTG-756"]}
