{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4347"}, "description": "This course will expose students to the theoretical and empirical \"building blocks\" that will allow them to develop and implement powerful models of customer behavior. Over the years, researchers and practitioners have used these methods for a wide variety of applications, such as new product sales forecasting, analyses of media usage, customer valuation, and targeted marketing programs. These same techniques are also very useful for other types of business (and non-business) problems. The course will be entirely lecture-based with a strong emphasis on real-time problem solving. Most sessions will feature sophisticated numerical investigations using Microsoft Excel. Much of the material is highly technical. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "APPL PROB MODELS MKTG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22090/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.97", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rRecommendMajor": "3.68", "rCourseQuality": "3.52", "rWorkRequired": "3.84", "rInstructorAccess": "3.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.84", "rCommAbility": "3.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "APPL PROB MODELS MKTG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-776-001", "path": "/courses/22090/sections/001", "id": "22090-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-776-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/22090/sections/001/reviews/2566-PETER-S-FADER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2566-PETER-S-FADER", "first_name": "PETER S", "last_name": "FADER", "id": "2566-PETER-S-FADER", "name": "PETER S FADER"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "22090-001-2566-PETER-S-FADER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-776", "path": "/courses/22090", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22090/sections", "values": [{"name": "APPL PROB MODELS MKTG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-776-001", "path": "/courses/22090/sections/001", "id": "22090-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-776-001"]}]}, "id": 22090, "aliases": ["MKTG-776"]}
