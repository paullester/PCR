Course textbook is Marketing Research (8th edition) by McDaniel and Gates, published by Wiley. MKTG 411 is a prerequisite. This course is for WPWP certificate students only. \r\n\r\nOverall, students found this course to be \u201cvery informative,\u201d but it required far more work than they had anticipated. One student stated, \u201cMany of the elements required in the final project were not covered in class or class reading.\u201d Students agreed that they would have \u201cpreferred the course grading structure to be less dependent upon group activities.\u201d However, students felt that they learned a lot from this course. \r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 main complaint with Professor Madway was that he took a very long time to grade and return assignments, so students rarely knew how they were faring in the class. Students felt that they \u201cwould have benefited from more consistent and timely feedback on assignments.\u201d Students praised Professor Madway for being \u201cextremely thorough in teaching us Marketing Research\u201d and agreed that he was always available and willing to answer any questions. Students felt that Professor Madway\u2019s \u201ccareer experience added tremendously to the course\u201d and found him to be an engaging lecturer. \r\n\r\nStudents found the projects, exams, and weekly homework assignments to be difficult and time consuming. One student commented that he had \u201cnever worked so much in any course in the WPWP program.\u201d Students agreed that the course would have been easier if they had received their homework and assignments back in a timely manner. Some students commented that the lectures moved slowly and often ran over time, and they were evaluated on some material that had not been presented or explained to them in lecture. \r\n", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/23448/sections/001/reviews/4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "MADWAY", "id": "4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY", "name": "WILLIAM MADWAY"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "23448-001-4670-WILLIAM-MADWAY"}]
