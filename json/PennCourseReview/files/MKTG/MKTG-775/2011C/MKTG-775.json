{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5137"}, "description": "As the concept of CRM becomes common parlance for every marketing executive, it is useful to take a step back to better understand the various different behaviors that underlie the development of successful CRM systems. These \"behaviors\" include customer-level decisions, firm actions, and the delicate but complex interplay between the two. Accordingly this course is comprised of four main modules. \n\nWe start with the discussion of customer profitability - focusing on the concepts of \"customer lifetime value\" and \"customer equity\". We will examine how to measure long-run customer profitability in both business-to-customer and business-to-business environments, and the uses of these measures as major components assessing overall firm valuation. Second, we move to the value that the firm provides to its customers - better understanding the true nature of customer satisfaction and its non-trivial relationship with firm profitability. Third, we examine each of the three main components of the firm's management of its customer base: customer acquisition, development, and retention - and the complex resource allocation task that must be balanced across them. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of various tactical and organizational aspects of customer relationship management. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CUSTMR RELATIONSHIP MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24788/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.39", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.02", "rRecommendMajor": "3.04", "rCourseQuality": "2.48", "rWorkRequired": "1.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.27", "rCommAbility": "2.87", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "CUSTMR RELATIONSHIP MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-775-001", "path": "/courses/24788/sections/001", "id": "24788-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-775-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/24788/sections/001/reviews/2566-PETER-S-FADER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2566-PETER-S-FADER", "first_name": "PETER S", "last_name": "FADER", "id": "2566-PETER-S-FADER", "name": "PETER S FADER"}, "num_reviewers": 64, "id": "24788-001-2566-PETER-S-FADER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MKTG-775", "path": "/courses/24788", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24788/sections", "values": [{"name": "CUSTMR RELATIONSHIP MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MKTG-775-001", "path": "/courses/24788/sections/001", "id": "24788-001", "aliases": ["MKTG-775-001"]}]}, "id": 24788, "aliases": ["MKTG-775"]}
