{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/650"}, "description": "Italian 140 is the second half of a two-semester intermediate sequence designed to help you attain a level of proficiency that will allow you to function comfortably in an Italian-speaking environment. The course will build on your existing skills in Italian, increase your confidence and your ability to read, write, speak and understand the language, and introduce you to more refined lexical items, more complex grammatical structures, and more challenging cultural material. You are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structures in elementary Italian and to review these on your own. The course will allow you to explore culturally relevant topics and to develop cross-cultural skills through the exploration of analogies and differences between your native culture and the Italian world. The course will move beyond stereotypical presentations of Italy and its people to concentrate on specific social issues together with cultural topics. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13442/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "0.50", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.43", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.14", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rInstructorConcern": "2.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rClassPace": "2.71", "rExamsConsistent": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rGradeFairness": "2.71", "rArticulateGoals": "2.71", "rOralSkills": "2.86", "rNativeAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rInstructorEffective": "2.71", "rSkillEmphasis": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-140-301", "path": "/courses/13442/sections/301", "id": "13442-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-140-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/13442/sections/301/reviews/1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON", "first_name": "MARINA DELLA PUTTA", "last_name": "JOHNSTON", "id": "1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON", "name": "MARINA DELLA PUTTA JOHNSTON"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "13442-301-1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-140", "path": "/courses/13442", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13442/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-140-301", "path": "/courses/13442/sections/301", "id": "13442-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-140-301"]}]}, "id": 13442, "aliases": ["ITAL-140"]}
