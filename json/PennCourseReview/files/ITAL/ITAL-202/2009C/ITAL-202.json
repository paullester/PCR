{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/651"}, "description": "In Italian 202 (formerly 205), students will perfect their communication skills to function in the formal register appropriate for an academic setting, while continuing to explore significant aspects of contemporary Italian culture and history. Students will take futher steps towards being able to understand in depth and to contextualize authentic Italian documents. Texts like films, songs, and a variety of readings, will be used as windows on particular historical periods, cultural movements, political issues, and social customs. They will serve as a tool to investigate the many facets of Italian identity and, at the same time, as a way to prepare those students who will continue their study of Italian literature and culture in higher-level courses. \n\nStudents are expected to participate willingly in conversations and all other class activities in order to perfect their oral and written ability to narrate, express opinion, hypothesize, and discuss a variety of topics quite accurately, using rich, appropriate vocabulary and grammar, and organizing paragraphs into well structured discourses, be they oral presentations, weekly compositions (2-2.5 pages) or the final essay (6-7 pages). To reach these goals, speaking, listening, reading and writing activities -- role plays, discussions, oral presentations, journals, grammar reviews -- will be based on audio-visual material and written texts provided by the instructor, and purchased and/or proposed by the students themselves, based on their independent explorations and research. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ADVANCED ITALIAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17563/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.58", "rTAQuality": "3.25", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.33", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.58", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rInstructorConcern": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.23", "rClassPace": "2.17", "rExamsConsistent": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58", "rGradeFairness": "3.67", "rArticulateGoals": "2.45", "rOralSkills": "3.17", "rNativeAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "1.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rInstructorEffective": "3.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ITAL-202-302", "path": "/courses/17563/sections/302", "id": "17563-302", "aliases": ["ITAL-202-302"]}, "comments": "This course aims at developing and deepening language abilities acquired in the first two years of study; it also prepares students for upper-level courses in literature, culture or cinema. Students will increase their vocabulary and speaking skills through the reading, analysis, and discussion of Niccol\u00f2 Amanniti\u2019s best-selling novel Io non ho paura. Other reading materials will open windows onto aspects of contemporary Italian culture and society. We will place special emphasis on a thorough review of advanced grammar. \r\n\r\nOverall, students really liked this class. One student appreciated the films that the course emphasized in its lessons, because they were both \u201centertaining and interesting ways in which to present some culture and history.\u201d The one consistent criticism students give the course, however, is its lack of emphasis on grammar. In general, many students took a liking to the intersection between Italian language and culture.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents had many positive things to say about Professor Johnston, including the way she \u201cinspires her students to enjoy learning Italian and speak it with more ease.\u201d Students also liked how Johnston would break them up into groups to work instead of always emphasizing class discussions.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nMost of the students who took this class had only started taking Italian while at Penn. Therefore some said it was hard to gain a concrete grasp without having more exposure to Italian grammar. One student recommended that the course be worth two credits. Short weekly compositions and a final project were the bulk of the work. This course is a prerequisite for other 200-level courses. \r\n", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/17563/sections/302/reviews/1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON", "first_name": "MARINA DELLA PUTTA", "last_name": "JOHNSTON", "id": "1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON", "name": "MARINA DELLA PUTTA JOHNSTON"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "17563-302-1527-MARINA-DELLA-PUTTA-JOHNSTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-202", "path": "/courses/17563", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17563/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ITAL-202-302", "path": "/courses/17563/sections/302", "id": "17563-302", "aliases": ["ITAL-202-302"]}]}, "id": 17563, "aliases": ["ITAL-202"]}
