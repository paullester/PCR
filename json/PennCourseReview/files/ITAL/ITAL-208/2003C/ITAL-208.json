{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1946"}, "description": "The major purpose of the course, which is conducted entirely in Italian and therefore requires an intermediate/high, to advanced level of the language, is to enable students to acquire language proficiency in the area of the current Italian labor world, so that they can read and comprehend business publications, write and compose business texts, and participate in business-related conversations. Business terminology will be placed within the framework of many different international work situations and practices, such as industry, trade, insurance, banking, agriculture, communications, etc. Classes will also include lectures on current political, economic, and labor developments in Italy as well as an examination of various Italian views on the creation of the European Internal Market. The course will emphasize, through Italian newspapers and magazine articles, the differences between Italian and American business practices and cultural differences, such as the attitude of the Italian towards money, work, leisure, and consumerism, which will help students to understand the specific nature of the Italian world. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "BUSINESS ITALIAN I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4316/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.33", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.89", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "3.22", "rInstructorConcern": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.56", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.89", "rGradeFairness": "3.89", "rArticulateGoals": "3.56", "rOralSkills": "3.78", "rNativeAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89", "rWorkRequired": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rInstructorEffective": "3.89", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "BUSINESS ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-208-301", "path": "/courses/4316/sections/301", "id": "4316-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-208-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/4316/sections/301/reviews/688-NICOLA-MASSIMO-GENTILI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/688-NICOLA-MASSIMO-GENTILI", "first_name": "NICOLA MASSIMO", "last_name": "GENTILI", "id": "688-NICOLA-MASSIMO-GENTILI", "name": "NICOLA MASSIMO GENTILI"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "4316-301-688-NICOLA-MASSIMO-GENTILI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-208", "path": "/courses/4316", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4316/sections", "values": [{"name": "BUSINESS ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-208-301", "path": "/courses/4316/sections/301", "id": "4316-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-208-301"]}]}, "id": 4316, "aliases": ["ITAL-208"]}
