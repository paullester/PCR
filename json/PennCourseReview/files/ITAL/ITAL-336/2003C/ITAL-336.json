{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2329"}, "description": "Dante's Divina Commedia will be read and discussed in Italian. The first half of the semester will be devoted to Inferno; the second half to selected cantos of the Purgatorio and Paradiso. We shall consider this masterpiece of Italian literature in the context of Dante's medieval worldview and culture, his identity as a Florentine, his politics, and his poetics. The text will be read in a facing Italian-English edition with class discussion in Italian designed to arrive at an appreciation of the poem that builds on the students' previous knowledge of the language and is geared toward developing skills of literary analysis in Italian. Visual materials from illustrated manuscripts of the Commedia and recently developed web-based resources will complement class readings. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "DIVINA COMMEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4320/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "DIVINA COMMEDIA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-336-301", "path": "/courses/4320/sections/301", "id": "4320-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-336-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/4320/sections/301/reviews/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "first_name": "VICTORIA E", "last_name": "KIRKHAM", "id": "680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "name": "VICTORIA E KIRKHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "4320-301-680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-336", "path": "/courses/4320", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4320/sections", "values": [{"name": "DIVINA COMMEDIA", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-336-301", "path": "/courses/4320/sections/301", "id": "4320-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-336-301"]}]}, "id": 4320, "aliases": ["ITAL-336"]}
