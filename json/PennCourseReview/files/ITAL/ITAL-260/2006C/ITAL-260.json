{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3418"}, "description": "This course explores the radical conflicts that developed in the 16th and 17th century Europe when Protestant reformers, scientific discoveries, and geographical explorations challenged a long-held Medieval worldview and the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. These historical developments will be studied in comparison with parallel modern issues, such as Darwinism, separation of church and state, multicultural religious conflicts. Historical readings: Machiavelli's comic play Mandragola, the vitriolic polemic involving Martin Luther, Thomas More, and King Henry VII; Thomas Campanella's Utopian dialogue The City of the Sun, selections from the scientists Copernicus and Galileo, and from The History of the Council of Trent by the Venetian Paolo Sarpi. Modern texts: Osborne's Luther, Brecht's Galileo, and a classic Hollywood film Utopia, Frank Capra's Lost Horizon. In introductory and final units, we shall consider how 16th and 17th century poetry and visual arts mirrored their turbulent times, with an attention to the Petrarchan tradition (Vittoria Colonna, Marino) and stylistic changes in Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture from Renaissance to Mannerist to Baroque. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "WORLDVIEWS IN COLLISION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9116/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.18", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.76", "rCommAbility": "2.65", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "WORLDVIEWS IN COLLISION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-260-301", "path": "/courses/9116/sections/301", "id": "9116-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-260-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/9116/sections/301/reviews/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "first_name": "VICTORIA E", "last_name": "KIRKHAM", "id": "680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM", "name": "VICTORIA E KIRKHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "9116-301-680-VICTORIA-E-KIRKHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-260", "path": "/courses/9116", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9116/sections", "values": [{"name": "WORLDVIEWS IN COLLISION", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-260-301", "path": "/courses/9116/sections/301", "id": "9116-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-260-301"]}]}, "id": 9116, "aliases": ["ITAL-260"]}
