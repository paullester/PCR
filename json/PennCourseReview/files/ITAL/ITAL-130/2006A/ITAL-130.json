{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/648"}, "description": "Italian 130 is the first half of a two-semester intermediate sequence designed to help you attain a level of proficiency that will allow you to function comfortably in an Italian-speaking environment. The course will build on your existing skills in Italian, increase your confidence and your ability to read, write, speak and understand the language, and introduce you to more refined lexical items, more complex grammatical structures, and more challenging cultural material. You are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structures in elementary Italian and to review these. The course textbook, together with all supplementary materials, will allow you to explore culturally relevant topics and to develop cross-cultural skills through the exploration of similarities and differences between your native culture and the Italian world. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7923/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.67", "rTAQuality": "0.67", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.58", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.83", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.58", "rInstructorConcern": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rClassPace": "2.25", "rExamsConsistent": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rGradeFairness": "3.67", "rArticulateGoals": "3.58", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rInstructorEffective": "3.67", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-130-301", "path": "/courses/7923/sections/301", "id": "7923-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-130-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/7923/sections/301/reviews/685-DANIELA-VIALE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/685-DANIELA-VIALE", "first_name": "DANIELA", "last_name": "VIALE", "id": "685-DANIELA-VIALE", "name": "DANIELA VIALE"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "7923-301-685-DANIELA-VIALE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-130", "path": "/courses/7923", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7923/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-130-301", "path": "/courses/7923/sections/301", "id": "7923-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-130-301"]}]}, "id": 7923, "aliases": ["ITAL-130"]}
