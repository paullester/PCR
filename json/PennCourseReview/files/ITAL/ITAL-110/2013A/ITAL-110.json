Students who have previously studied Italian are required to take the placement test. Class work emphasizes the development of the oral-aural skills, speaking and listening. Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included. Out-of-class homework requires work with the Internet, audio and video materials. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30496/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rTAQuality": "4.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rClassPace": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rNativeAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33", "rInstructorEffective": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/30496/sections/301", "id": "30496-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/30496/sections/301/reviews/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "first_name": "HELEN MCFIE", "last_name": "SIMONE", "id": "687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "name": "HELEN MCFIE SIMONE"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "30496-301-687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-110", "path": "/courses/30496", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30496/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/30496/sections/301", "id": "30496-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}]}, "id": 30496, "aliases": ["ITAL-110"]}
