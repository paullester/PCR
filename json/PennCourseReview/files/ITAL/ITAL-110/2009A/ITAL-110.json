Students who have previously studied Italian are required to take the placement test. Class work emphasizes the development of the oral-aural skills, speaking and listening. Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included. Out-of-class homework requires work with the Internet, audio and video materials. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15946/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.83", "rTAQuality": "2.75", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.75", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.83", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.08", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rInstructorConcern": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.53", "rClassPace": "2.17", "rExamsConsistent": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rGradeFairness": "2.92", "rArticulateGoals": "3.50", "rOralSkills": "3.92", "rNativeAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.92", "rInstructorEffective": "3.42", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/15946/sections/301", "id": "15946-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/15946/sections/301/reviews/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "first_name": "HELEN MCFIE", "last_name": "SIMONE", "id": "687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "name": "HELEN MCFIE SIMONE"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "15946-301-687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-110", "path": "/courses/15946", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15946/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/15946/sections/301", "id": "15946-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}]}, "id": 15946, "aliases": ["ITAL-110"]}
