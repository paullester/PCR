Students who have previously studied Italian are required to take the placement test. Class work emphasizes the development of the oral-aural skills, speaking and listening. Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included. Out-of-class homework requires work with the Internet, audio and video materials. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21908/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.46", "rTAQuality": "3.25", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.69", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.69", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "3.31", "rInstructorConcern": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rClassPace": "2.23", "rExamsConsistent": "3.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rGradeFairness": "3.50", "rArticulateGoals": "3.38", "rOralSkills": "3.69", "rNativeAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.54", "rStimulateInterest": "3.54", "rInstructorEffective": "3.23", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/21908/sections/301", "id": "21908-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/21908/sections/301/reviews/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "first_name": "HELEN MCFIE", "last_name": "SIMONE", "id": "687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "name": "HELEN MCFIE SIMONE"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "21908-301-687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-110", "path": "/courses/21908", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21908/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/21908/sections/301", "id": "21908-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}]}, "id": 21908, "aliases": ["ITAL-110"]}
