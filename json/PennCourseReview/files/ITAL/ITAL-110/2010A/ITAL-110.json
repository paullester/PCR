Students who have previously studied Italian are required to take the placement test. Class work emphasizes the development of the oral-aural skills, speaking and listening. Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included. Out-of-class homework requires work with the Internet, audio and video materials. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26249/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.54", "rTAQuality": "2.80", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.38", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.85", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.54", "rReadingsValue": "3.62", "rInstructorConcern": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rClassPace": "2.15", "rExamsConsistent": "3.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.15", "rGradeFairness": "3.77", "rArticulateGoals": "3.69", "rOralSkills": "3.85", "rNativeAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.23", "rStimulateInterest": "3.62", "rInstructorEffective": "3.38", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/26249/sections/301", "id": "26249-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/26249/sections/301/reviews/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "first_name": "HELEN MCFIE", "last_name": "SIMONE", "id": "687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE", "name": "HELEN MCFIE SIMONE"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "26249-301-687-HELEN-MCFIE-SIMONE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-110", "path": "/courses/26249", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26249/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/26249/sections/301", "id": "26249-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}]}, "id": 26249, "aliases": ["ITAL-110"]}
