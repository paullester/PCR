Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included. Out-of-class homework requires work with the Internet, audio and video materials. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10592/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.89", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.56", "rInstructorConcern": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.89", "rClassPace": "2.22", "rExamsConsistent": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rGradeFairness": "3.89", "rArticulateGoals": "3.89", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.56", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "3.89", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-302", "path": "/courses/10592/sections/302", "id": "10592-302", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/10592/sections/302/reviews/2524-CRYSTAL-J--HALL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2524-CRYSTAL-J--HALL", "first_name": "CRYSTAL J.", "last_name": "HALL", "id": "2524-CRYSTAL-J--HALL", "name": "CRYSTAL J.
