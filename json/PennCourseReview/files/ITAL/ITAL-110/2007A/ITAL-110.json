Students who have previously studied Italian are required to take the placement test. Class work emphasizes the development of the oral-aural skills, speaking and listening. Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included. Out-of-class homework requires work with the Internet, audio and video materials. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14690/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.91", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.64", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rInstructorConcern": "3.91", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82", "rGradeFairness": "3.82", "rArticulateGoals": "3.82", "rOralSkills": "3.91", "rNativeAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "0.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.91", "rInstructorEffective": "3.91", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.91"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/14690/sections/301", "id": "14690-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/14690/sections/301/reviews/3019-LOREN-M-VALTERZA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3019-LOREN-M-VALTERZA", "first_name": "LOREN M", "last_name": "VALTERZA", "id": "3019-LOREN-M-VALTERZA", "name": "LOREN M VALTERZA"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "14690-301-3019-LOREN-M-VALTERZA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-110", "path": "/courses/14690", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14690/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY ITALIAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-110-301", "path": "/courses/14690/sections/301", "id": "14690-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-110-301"]}]}, "id": 14690, "aliases": ["ITAL-110"]}
