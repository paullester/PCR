{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/653"}, "description": "Focusing on the moon and its nocturnal effects as represented in film, opera, literature and art, this course offers a survey of the last four centuries of Italian literature and culture. Man stepped on the Moon on July 20, 1969 and since then Armstrong's footprint has remained in the lunar dust. We know now that the Moon is a vast and deserted landscape where no life is possible. Now that we have succeeded in contaminating the Moon with our presence, is Science Fiction the only possible discourse on the Moon other than the one carried on by astronomers? What is left of the romantic lunar dream? Can those human footprints destroy the image of the kissing faces that romantic painters saw on the lunar disk? Can we still fly on the Moon looking for Orlando's common sense? or imagine our satellite populated by lurid, gesticulating goblins who cause the monstrous metamorphosis of werewolves? Have we finally succeeded in realizing the futuristic scream by Marinetti \"Let's kill the moonlight?\" These are some of the questions this course will address and discuss by reading or viewing works (in their entirety or in excerpts) by the following authors: Luciano, Ariosto, Tasso, Galileo, Goldoni, Pindemonte, Parini, Leopardi, Bellini, Donizzetti, Salgari, Capuana, D'Annunzio Pirandello, Fellini, Calvino. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "SURVEY OF ITAL CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10602/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "SURVEY OF ITAL CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-216-301", "path": "/courses/10602/sections/301", "id": "10602-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-216-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/10602/sections/301/reviews/1531-STEFANO-CRACOLICI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1531-STEFANO-CRACOLICI", "first_name": "STEFANO", "last_name": "CRACOLICI", "id": "1531-STEFANO-CRACOLICI", "name": "STEFANO CRACOLICI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "10602-301-1531-STEFANO-CRACOLICI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-216", "path": "/courses/10602", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10602/sections", "values": [{"name": "SURVEY OF ITAL CULTURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-216-301", "path": "/courses/10602/sections/301", "id": "10602-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-216-301"]}]}, "id": 10602, "aliases": ["ITAL-216"]}
