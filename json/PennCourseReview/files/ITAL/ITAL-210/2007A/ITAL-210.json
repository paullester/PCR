{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1947"}, "description": "The purpose of this conversation course, held entirely in Italian, is to improve the use of spoken contemporary Italian in a pragmatic perspective. On the basis of inputs coming from articles, songs, pictures, short stories, and clips from movies and television, students will discuss some aspects of Italian contemporary civilization, and, at the same time, practice different forms and expand vocabulary in various communicative situations. Politics, lifestyle, fashion, literature, music, and art will be the subjects of structured activities, such as role-plays, debates, discussions and short interviews and oral presentations. Differences between popular and standard, formal and colloquial speech will be emphasized. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ITALIA VIVA VOCE: VIVA VOCE: ADV.
