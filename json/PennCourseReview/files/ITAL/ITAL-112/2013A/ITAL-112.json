Students who have fulfilled the language requirement in a language other than a romance language will be considered on an individual basis. All students must have departmental permission to register. \n\nClass work emphasizes the development of the oral-aural skills, speaking and and listening. Readings on topics in Italian culture as well as frequent writing practice are also included.
