{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/649"}, "description": "Italian 134 is the intensive and accelerated course that combines in one semester the intermediate sequence (130 and 140). It will build on your existing skills in Italian, increase your confidence and your ability to read, write, speak and understand the language, and introduce you to more refined lexical items, more complex grammatical structures, and more challenging cultural material. You are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structures in elementary Italian and to review these on your own. The course will allow you to explore culturally relevant topics and to develop cross-cultural skills through the exploration of similarities and differences between your native culture and the Italian world. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN-ACC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4312/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.38", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.88", "rInstructorConcern": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rGradeFairness": "3.88", "rArticulateGoals": "3.63", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "0.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rInstructorEffective": "3.75", "rSkillEmphasis": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN-ACC", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-134-301", "path": "/courses/4312/sections/301", "id": "4312-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-134-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/4312/sections/301/reviews/685-DANIELA-VIALE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/685-DANIELA-VIALE", "first_name": "DANIELA", "last_name": "VIALE", "id": "685-DANIELA-VIALE", "name": "DANIELA VIALE"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "4312-301-685-DANIELA-VIALE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ITAL-134", "path": "/courses/4312", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4312/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE ITALIAN-ACC", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ITAL-134-301", "path": "/courses/4312/sections/301", "id": "4312-301", "aliases": ["ITAL-134-301"]}]}, "id": 4312, "aliases": ["ITAL-134"]}
