The main topics to be covered are mergers and friendly acquisitions, hostile takeovers and buyouts. Using case studies, the course surveys the drivers of success in the transactions. While issues regarding motive and strategy will be discussed, financial theory would be the main lens used to view these control-acquiring transactions. The objective is two-fold: (1) Develop a concept and translate that idea into a proposal through deal design; and (2) analyze to form opinions about proposed deals. The course should be of interest to students interested in pursuing careers as private equity investors, advisors in investment banking and corporate managers that deal with these issues. \r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201ca good wrap-up for those with lots of finance experience already.\u201d One wrote that \u201cas a finance concentrator, I'm really happy to have taken this class because I feel that it has solidified what I've learned in the last few years.\u201d Most students appreciated the material\u2019s real-world applications, but one student criticized the focus on less relevant issues like \u201cauction theory and soft factors.\u201d \r\n\r\nProfessor Yilmaz was described as an effective and engaging instructor, although several reviewers suggested that there was too much emphasis on group work over individual assignments. This review is based on the seven student comments that were submitted. \r\n", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/23095/sections/001/reviews/2138-BILGE-YILMAZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2138-BILGE-YILMAZ", "first_name": "BILGE", "last_name": "YILMAZ", "id": "2138-BILGE-YILMAZ", "name": "BILGE YILMAZ"}, "num_reviewers": 55, "id": "23095-001-2138-BILGE-YILMAZ"}]
