{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3092"}, "description": "The course focuses on financial tools, techniques, and best practices used in buyouts (financial buyers) and acquisitions (strategic buyers). While it will touch upon various strategic, organizational, and general management issues, the main lens for studying these transactions will be a financial one. It will explore how different buyers approach the process of finding, evaluating, and analyzing opportunities in the corporate-control market; how they structure deals and how deal structure affects both value creation and value division; how they add value after transaction completion; and how they realizetheir ultimate objectives (such as enhanced market position or a profitable exit). The course is divided into two broad modules. The first module covers buyouts by private equity partnerships, and the second one studies mergers and acquisitions. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "FNCE OF BUYOUTS & ACQS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7755/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "3.39", "rInstructorAccess": "2.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.76", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "FNCE OF BUYOUTS & ACQS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-251-001", "path": "/courses/7755/sections/001", "id": "7755-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-251-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/7755/sections/001/reviews/2971-VINAY-NAIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2971-VINAY-NAIR", "first_name": "VINAY", "last_name": "NAIR", "id": "2971-VINAY-NAIR", "name": "VINAY NAIR"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "7755-001-2971-VINAY-NAIR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-251", "path": "/courses/7755", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7755/sections", "values": [{"name": "FNCE OF BUYOUTS & ACQS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-251-001", "path": "/courses/7755/sections/001", "id": "7755-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-251-001"]}]}, "id": 7755, "aliases": ["FNCE-251"]}
