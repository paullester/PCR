However, students highly suggested that others take FNCE 207 (Corporate Valuation), or at least have had some form of banking internship, before taking this course. One commented that \u201cthe deal proposals require some prior experience.\u201d \r\n\r\nMost students really enjoyed Professor Savor\u2019s teaching styles. Some described him as \u201cone of the best teachers at Wharton.\u201d One student stated that Professor Savor would be even better if he \u201cwould change the wording on the exams, which was sometimes difficult to understand.\u201d Professor Savor was also described as having \u201can incredible wealth of knowledge on the material.\u201d \r\n\r\nMost students taking this course were Wharton upperclassmen, specifically those concentrating in Finance. Most would recommend this course to students planning to go into the investment banking or private equity field. \r\n\r\n*This review is based on 8 student comments.\r\n", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/24430/sections/001/reviews/3968-PAVEL-G--SAVOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3968-PAVEL-G--SAVOR", "first_name": "PAVEL G.", "last_name": "SAVOR", "id": "3968-PAVEL-G--SAVOR", "name": "PAVEL G.
