{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4256"}, "description": "This course examines the available corporate securities that firms can use to finance investment. The course will focus on: (1) the design of these securities (Why do bonds have embedded options? What is the role of preferred stock?); (2) the issuing process for these securities (What do investment banks do? Is the underwriting process important for the cost of capital?); (3) the pricing of these securities (How are credit risk in bonds and loans priced?) The securities covered include corporate and junk bonds, bank loans, common and preferred equity, commercial paper, securitization, as well as some recent innovations. Other topics include the role of embedded options in corporate bonds; the role of bank and loan covenants; the function of bond rating agencies; exchange offers; prepackaged bankruptcies; bankruptcy Chapter 11; workouts; debtor-in-possession financing; and pricing credit risk. The course is designed to be complementary to Advanced Corporate Finance and Fixed Income Securities. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "FUNDING INVESTMENTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15783/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.40", "rDifficulty": "3.26", "rStimulateInterest": "1.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.61", "rCourseQuality": "2.16", "rWorkRequired": "3.55", "rInstructorAccess": "2.08", "rReadingsValue": "2.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.41", "rCommAbility": "1.77", "rInstructorQuality": "1.84"}, "section": {"name": "FUNDING INVESTMENTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-738-001", "path": "/courses/15783/sections/001", "id": "15783-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-738-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/15783/sections/001/reviews/4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "first_name": "ROBERT", "last_name": "HAUSWALD", "id": "4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "name": "ROBERT HAUSWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 69, "id": "15783-001-4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.47", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "1.87", "rRecommendMajor": "2.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.02", "rWorkRequired": "3.58", "rInstructorAccess": "2.04", "rReadingsValue": "1.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.49", "rCommAbility": "1.94", "rInstructorQuality": "1.93"}, "section": {"name": "FUNDING INVESTMENTS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-738-002", "path": "/courses/15783/sections/002", "id": "15783-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-738-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 65, "path": "/courses/15783/sections/002/reviews/4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "first_name": "ROBERT", "last_name": "HAUSWALD", "id": "4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "name": "ROBERT HAUSWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 62, "id": "15783-002-4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-738", "path": "/courses/15783", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15783/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUNDING INVESTMENTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-738-001", "path": "/courses/15783/sections/001", "id": "15783-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-738-001"]}, {"name": "FUNDING INVESTMENTS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-738-002", "path": "/courses/15783/sections/002", "id": "15783-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-738-002"]}]}, "id": 15783, "aliases": ["FNCE-738"]}
