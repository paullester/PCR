{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4258"}, "description": "This class offers an advanced analysis of complex derivative pricing models. It aims to build an integrated framework allowing students to: 1) decide what factors (e.g., stochastic volatility, jumps, stochastic interest rates, credit risk) should be incorporated in a reasonable pricing model for the given derivative; 2) formulate a consistent model incorporating the chosen factors; 3) calibrate the model using market data; 4) price the derivative and identify a hedging strategy. To allow for sufficient flexibility, the class will not place any special emphasis on models leading to closed-form valuation formulas (such as the Black-Scholes model), relying instead on the generality afforded by the martingale approach and Monte-Carlo simulation. Students will be asked to implement the models introduced in the class using VBA and Crystal Ball (an Excel Add-In specifically designed for Monte-Carlo simulation). \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "Advanced Seminar - FINANCIAL ENGINEERING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27450/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.76", "rDifficulty": "3.82", "rStimulateInterest": "3.12", "rRecommendMajor": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "3.61", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.59", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "Advanced Seminar - FINANCIAL ENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNCE-892-401", "path": "/courses/27450/sections/401", "id": "27450-401", "aliases": ["FNCE-892-401", "FNCE-392-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/27450/sections/401/reviews/4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "first_name": "DOMENICO", "last_name": "CUOCO", "id": "4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "name": "DOMENICO CUOCO"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "27450-401-4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "3.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "3.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.44", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED SEMINAR: Financial Engineering", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNCE-892-402", "path": "/courses/27450/sections/402", "id": "27450-402", "aliases": ["FNCE-892-402", "FNCE-392-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/27450/sections/402/reviews/4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "first_name": "DOMENICO", "last_name": "CUOCO", "id": "4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "name": "DOMENICO CUOCO"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "27450-402-4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-892", "path": "/courses/27450", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27450/sections", "values": [{"name": "Advanced Seminar - FINANCIAL ENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNCE-892-401", "path": "/courses/27450/sections/401", "id": "27450-401", "aliases": ["FNCE-892-401", "FNCE-392-401"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED SEMINAR: Financial Engineering", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNCE-892-402", "path": "/courses/27450/sections/402", "id": "27450-402", "aliases": ["FNCE-892-402", "FNCE-392-402"]}]}, "id": 27450, "aliases": ["FNCE-892", "FNCE-392"]}
