{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4258"}, "description": "This class offers an advanced analysis of complex derivative pricing models. It aims to build an integrated framework allowing students to: 1) decide what factors (e.g., stochastic volatility, jumps, stochastic interest rates, credit risk) should be incorporated in a reasonable pricing model for the given derivative; 2) formulate a consistent model incorporating the chosen factors; 3) calibrate the model using market data; 4) price the derivative and identify a hedging strategy. To allow for sufficient flexibility, the class will not place any special emphasis on models leading to closed-form valuation formulas (such as the Black-Scholes model), relying instead on the generality afforded by the martingale approach and Monte-Carlo simulation. Students will be asked to implement the models introduced in the class using VBA and Crystal Ball (an Excel Add-In specifically designed for Monte-Carlo simulation). \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "ADVANCED SEMINAR: Financial Engineering", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15785/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.72", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.39", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED SEMINAR: Financial Engineering", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNCE-892-401", "path": "/courses/15785/sections/401", "id": "15785-401", "aliases": ["FNCE-892-401", "FNCE-392-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/15785/sections/401/reviews/4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "first_name": "DOMENICO", "last_name": "CUOCO", "id": "4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO", "name": "DOMENICO CUOCO"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "15785-401-4343-DOMENICO-CUOCO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-892", "path": "/courses/15785", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15785/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED SEMINAR: Financial Engineering", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNCE-892-401", "path": "/courses/15785/sections/401", "id": "15785-401", "aliases": ["FNCE-892-401", "FNCE-392-401"]}]}, "id": 15785, "aliases": ["FNCE-892", "FNCE-392"]}
