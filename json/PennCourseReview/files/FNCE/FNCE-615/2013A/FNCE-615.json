{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5663"}, "description": "FNCE 615 is a half-semester overview of macroeconomics. It is intended strictly for non-Finance majors. Any student who contemplates majoring in Finance should be aware that this course does not count in any way toward the Finance major. This course is new to the curriculum and is still under design. It will likely begin with the national income and products, which are the basic source of data on important macroeconomic data such as GDP, consumption, investment, exports and imports as well as prices. The course will also discuss other major sources of macroeconomic data, such as the monthly employment report and the consumer price index. These data descriptions will provide students with a basic level of macroeconomic literacy and will serve as the basis for analyzing specific topics and issues in macroeconomics. At of this writing, the set of topics and issues is still to be determined, but students should be aware that the half-semester format of the course will limit the breadth and depth of topics. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30329/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "2.92", "rTAQuality": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.62", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.15", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.54", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "2.85"}, "section": {"name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-615-002", "path": "/courses/30329/sections/002", "id": "30329-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-615-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/30329/sections/002/reviews/6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "first_name": "ANTHONY", "last_name": "LANDRY", "id": "6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "name": "ANTHONY LANDRY"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "30329-002-6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rTAQuality": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.18", "rRecommendMajor": "2.76", "rCourseQuality": "2.72", "rWorkRequired": "2.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.19", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.53", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06"}, "section": {"name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "sectionnum": "004", "primary_alias": "FNCE-615-004", "path": "/courses/30329/sections/004", "id": "30329-004", "aliases": ["FNCE-615-004"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/30329/sections/004/reviews/6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "first_name": "ANTHONY", "last_name": "LANDRY", "id": "6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "name": "ANTHONY LANDRY"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "30329-004-6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rTAQuality": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "3.04", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "sectionnum": "006", "primary_alias": "FNCE-615-006", "path": "/courses/30329/sections/006", "id": "30329-006", "aliases": ["FNCE-615-006"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/30329/sections/006/reviews/6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "first_name": "ANTHONY", "last_name": "LANDRY", "id": "6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY", "name": "ANTHONY LANDRY"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "30329-006-6098-ANTHONY-LANDRY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-615", "path": "/courses/30329", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30329/sections", "values": [{"name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-615-002", "path": "/courses/30329/sections/002", "id": "30329-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-615-002"]}, {"name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "sectionnum": "004", "primary_alias": "FNCE-615-004", "path": "/courses/30329/sections/004", "id": "30329-004", "aliases": ["FNCE-615-004"]}, {"name": "MACROECONOMICS (HALF CU)", "sectionnum": "006", "primary_alias": "FNCE-615-006", "path": "/courses/30329/sections/006", "id": "30329-006", "aliases": ["FNCE-615-006"]}]}, "id": 30329, "aliases": ["FNCE-615"]}
