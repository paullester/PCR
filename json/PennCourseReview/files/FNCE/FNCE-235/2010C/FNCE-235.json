Some also said that he did a great job of \u201cstimulating student interest.\u201d A select few commented on a slight disconnect between the course pack provided for the course and Professor Dieckman\u2019s lectures. \r\n\r\nGrading is based on two midterm exams, a final project, and problem sets. Prerequisites are FNCE101 and STAT10. Though this course is open to both Wharton freshmen and upperclassmen, students emphasized the importance of the prerequisites in understanding the course material.\r\n", "num_students": 70, "path": "/courses/23092/sections/001/reviews/5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN", "first_name": "STEPHAN", "last_name": "DIECKMANN", "id": "5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN", "name": "STEPHAN DIECKMANN"}, "num_reviewers": 68, "id": "23092-001-5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-235", "path": "/courses/23092", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23092/sections", "values": [{"name": "FIXED INCOME SECURITIES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-235-001", "path": "/courses/23092/sections/001", "id": "23092-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-235-001"]}]}, "id": 23092, "aliases": ["FNCE-235"]}
