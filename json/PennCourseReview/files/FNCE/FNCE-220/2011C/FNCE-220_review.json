It examines how current and historical events are reshaping the industry. The course focuses on the basic analytics of managing a bank's exposure to liquidity, credit, market and country risk. In addition, students will consider how to evaluate and compare the risk exposures and performance of individual banks. Throughout the semester students will discuss public policy issues such as international debt crises and regulation. \r\n\r\nStudents found the course \"very relevant to current events\" and generally enjoyed the course. \r\n\r\nProfessor Herring was called a very \"knowledgeable and passionate.\" He often extended his office hours to answer questions and was a \"wonderful lecturer.\"\r\n\r\nStudents would recommend this course to those who plan to enter the financial services industry, as it explains \"current events, existing and impending financial regulations, and the dynamics of bank failures.\" Some students thought the amount of material was extensive. The readings were long but helpful for exams. Many students who took the class already had experience in investment banking. FNCE 100 and FNCE 101 are prerequisites.\r\n", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/24427/sections/001/reviews/1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING", "first_name": "RICHARD J", "last_name": "HERRING", "id": "1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING", "name": "RICHARD J HERRING"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "24427-001-1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "2.87", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.34", "rCourseQuality": "2.98", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "INTERNATIONAL BANKING", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-220-002", "path": "/courses/24427/sections/002", "id": "24427-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-220-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/24427/sections/002/reviews/1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING", "first_name": "RICHARD J", "last_name": "HERRING", "id": "1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING", "name": "RICHARD J HERRING"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "24427-002-1436-RICHARD-J-HERRING"}]
