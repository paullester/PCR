{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2821"}, "description": "There is an abundance of evidence suggesting that the standard economic paradigm - rational agents in an efficent market - does not adequately describe behavior in financial markets. In this course, we will survey the evidence and use psychology to guide alternative theories of financial markets. Along the way, we will address the standard argument that smart, profit-seeing agents can correct any distortions caused by irrational investors. Further, we will examine more closely the preferences and trading decisions of individual investors. We will argue that their systematic biases can aggregate into observed market inefficiencies. The second half of the course extends the analysis to corporate decision making. We then explore the evidence for both views in the context of capital structure, investment, dividend, and merger decisions. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6560/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.37", "rDifficulty": "1.73", "rStimulateInterest": "1.44", "rRecommendMajor": "2.35", "rCourseQuality": "2.22", "rWorkRequired": "1.62", "rInstructorAccess": "2.26", "rReadingsValue": "1.85", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.62", "rCommAbility": "1.74", "rInstructorQuality": "1.69"}, "section": {"name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-239-001", "path": "/courses/6560/sections/001", "id": "6560-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-239-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/6560/sections/001/reviews/2766-GEOFFREY-A-TATE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2766-GEOFFREY-A-TATE", "first_name": "GEOFFREY A", "last_name": "TATE", "id": "2766-GEOFFREY-A-TATE", "name": "GEOFFREY A TATE"}, "num_reviewers": 31, "id": "6560-001-2766-GEOFFREY-A-TATE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-239", "path": "/courses/6560", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6560/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-239-001", "path": "/courses/6560/sections/001", "id": "6560-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-239-001"]}]}, "id": 6560, "aliases": ["FNCE-239"]}
