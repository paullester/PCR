{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4568"}, "description": "This course is intended for those students wishing to prepare for the PlacementExam into FNCE 621. The FNCE 621 course will fulfill the core requirement in financial analysis in half a semester, instead of the usual full semester in the FNCE 601 course. Only the students with some prior knowledge of financial analysis (either by course work or by practical experience), or with some strong analytical backgrounds should consider taking this course and the Placement Exam. Together FNCE 604 and FNCE 621 form the foundation for subsequent courses in corporate finance, security analysis, investments, and speculative markets. Their purpose is to develop a framework for analyzing a firm's investment and financing decisions. FNCE 604 will provide an introduction to present value and capital budgeting techniques under certainty. The FNCE 621 course will start where FNCE 604 stops, and will cover capital budgeting techniqes under uncertainty, asset valuation, the operation and efficiency of capital markets, and the optimal capital structure of the firm \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "PREP FOR ACCEL CORP FIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17381/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.84", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.52", "rWorkRequired": "2.37", "rInstructorAccess": "3.81", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "PREP FOR ACCEL CORP FIN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-604-001", "path": "/courses/17381/sections/001", "id": "17381-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-604-001"]}, "comments": "FNCE 604, with FNCE 621, forms the foundation for subsequent courses in corporate finance, security analysis, investments and speculative markets.
