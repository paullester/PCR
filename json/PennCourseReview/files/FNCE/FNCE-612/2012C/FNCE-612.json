{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5537"}, "description": "This course is intended for students with prior knowledge of finance or with strong analytical backgrounds. Together with the pre-term preparation course (FNCE604), it forms the foundation for subsequent courses in corporate finance, corporate valuation, investments, and financial derivatives. Its purpose is to develop a framework for analyzing a firm's investment and financial decisions. This course will start where FNCE 604 ends. More precisely, it will provide an introduction to capital budgeting techniques under uncertainty, asset valuation, the operation and efficiency of capital markets, the optimal capital structure and dividend policy of the firm and options. In short, it will cover all the topics of a typical semester-long finance introduction class in six weeks. This course assumes that students are familiar with the material covered in FNCE 604. As a result, it is only available to those students who successfully passed the Finance Placement Exam at the end of the pre-term. This course is not suitable for students new to finance and with limited analytical backgrounds. This course is hard. The pace is fast and it requires a major investment of time and effort outside class. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28970/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.52", "rDifficulty": "3.32", "rStimulateInterest": "3.81", "rRecommendMajor": "3.84", "rCourseQuality": "3.68", "rWorkRequired": "3.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.97", "rReadingsValue": "3.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.87", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-612-001", "path": "/courses/28970/sections/001", "id": "28970-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-612-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/28970/sections/001/reviews/4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "first_name": "ALEXANDER", "last_name": "EDMANS", "id": "4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "name": "ALEXANDER EDMANS"}, "num_reviewers": 31, "id": "28970-001-4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "3.22", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.64", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.35", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.96"}, "section": {"name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-612-003", "path": "/courses/28970/sections/003", "id": "28970-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-612-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/28970/sections/003/reviews/4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "first_name": "ALEXANDER", "last_name": "EDMANS", "id": "4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "name": "ALEXANDER EDMANS"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "28970-003-4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.42", "rDifficulty": "3.42", "rStimulateInterest": "3.76", "rRecommendMajor": "3.74", "rCourseQuality": "3.48", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.91", "rReadingsValue": "3.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.71", "rCommAbility": "3.68", "rInstructorQuality": "3.72"}, "section": {"name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "005", "primary_alias": "FNCE-612-005", "path": "/courses/28970/sections/005", "id": "28970-005", "aliases": ["FNCE-612-005"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 88, "path": "/courses/28970/sections/005/reviews/4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "first_name": "ALEXANDER", "last_name": "EDMANS", "id": "4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS", "name": "ALEXANDER EDMANS"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "28970-005-4806-ALEXANDER-EDMANS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-612", "path": "/courses/28970", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28970/sections", "values": [{"name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-612-001", "path": "/courses/28970/sections/001", "id": "28970-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-612-001"]}, {"name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-612-003", "path": "/courses/28970/sections/003", "id": "28970-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-612-003"]}, {"name": "ACCELERATED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "005", "primary_alias": "FNCE-612-005", "path": "/courses/28970/sections/005", "id": "28970-005", "aliases": ["FNCE-612-005"]}]}, "id": 28970, "aliases": ["FNCE-612"]}
