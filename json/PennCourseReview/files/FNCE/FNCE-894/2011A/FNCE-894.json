{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4958"}, "description": "The goal of this course is to teach you how to manage a real portfolio of Treasury, corporate and mortgage bonds. We begin by learning how to infer market forecasts from current bond prices. We use analytical models to find the market forecasts and the prices the market is offering for bearing the different types of risks. To implement the concepts learned in class, students will form teams to manage a paper portfolio using Barclays Point (formerly Lehman Point) a state-of-the-art portfolio management system. Your team will trade a $100 million portfolio of bonds for which your goal will be to outperform the Barclays Aggregate Index. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "Managing Fixed Income Portfolios", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21745/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.39", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "2.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.05", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.96", "rCommAbility": "2.96", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06"}, "section": {"name": "Managing Fixed Income Portfolios", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-894-001", "path": "/courses/21745/sections/001", "id": "21745-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-894-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/21745/sections/001/reviews/5364-SCOTT-F--RICHARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5364-SCOTT-F--RICHARD", "first_name": "SCOTT F.", "last_name": "RICHARD", "id": "5364-SCOTT-F--RICHARD", "name": "SCOTT F.
