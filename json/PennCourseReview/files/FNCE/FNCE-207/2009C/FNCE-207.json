According to one student, the course was an \u201cexcellent, exhaustive approach to financial modeling and valuation,\u201d and according to another, it was, simply, \u201clegendary.\u201d Opinion on the applicability of the course to real-world financial valuation was varied. One student noted that the course was \u201cnot great if you are looking for practical experience,\u201d whereas another student explained, \u201cComing from a summer internship in investment banking, I felt that this course truly complemented what I learned over the summer,\u201d and a third affirmed, \u201cI\u2019m going into banking next year and feel like I really have a leg up after taking this course.\u201d \r\n\r\nAlmost all student feedback about Professor Holthausen was strongly positive. One student avowed that Professor Holthausen was \u201cthe best professor I\u2019ve had, this being my 7th semester at Penn.\u201d Professor Holthausen \u201cexpects a lot from his students,\u201d one student commented, but \u201cthis is ok with me: he\u2019s got a very sought after class, and so he needs to make it difficult.\u201d At least one student thought that the pace of lectures was too fast. \r\n\r\nAccording to some students, the course required a strong previous exposure to accounting. It was also highly recommended for anyone going into investment banking, private equity, and other similar fields of finance. As one student put it, \u201cIf you want to work in finance, you must take this class, with this professor.
