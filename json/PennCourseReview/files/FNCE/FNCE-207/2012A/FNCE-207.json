Prerequisites: FNCE 100, FNCE 101, and STAT 101-102 (Financial accounting, ACCT 201, recommended).\r\nStudents felt that they \u201cdefinitely learned a lot about accounting and valuation from this class.\u201d While it was a \u201ctedious course,\u201d the \u201cknowledge gained out of it is worth the effort and the time.\u201d It was overall a \u201cvery strong course that significantly improved [students\u2019] knowledge.\u201d Students left the class feeling they \u201cfinally really [understand] the concepts of cash flows, betas, returns etc.\u201d \u201cThe valuation project was an extremely rewarding hands-on experience.\u201d Students who have had investment banking experience thought the \u201cdetail taught in this class was far and beyond what is expected at the professional level.\u201d\r\nProfessor Glode was \u201cvery helpful and enthusiastic about the course which made it much easier to understand the topics covered. \u201c He is \u201cvery knowledgeable\u201d and \u201ctries his best to teach his class well.\u201d Lectures were \u201cconveyed in an understandable manner, well-explained, and backed-up with examples.\u201d However, \u201che could have dealt with students' questions more professionally.\u201d\r\nThe course was \u201cdifficult, because it requires a lot of work but at the same time is the most valuable aspect.\u201d The valuation project comprises \u201c30% of the course grade\u201d but takes \u201cmonths to complete\u201d and a significant amount of work. Some students felt that class material did not \u201cadequately prepare students for the main project,\u201d as each company has nuances that may not be covered in class. \u201cIt was clear that teams that did well had had prior valuation experience.\u201d \u201cHaving a competent team that you get along with is crucial because it makes delegation easier and the long hours with each other more enjoyable.\u201d Overall, students felt that this was a \u201cvery intellectually stimulating course that is definitely worth doing regardless of what major the student is undertaking.\u201d  This class is \u201cless valuable for people who already have investment banking experience but very valuable for those intending to try it out.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/27427/sections/001/reviews/5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "first_name": "VINCENT", "last_name": "GLODE", "id": "5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "name": "VINCENT GLODE"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "27427-001-5358-VINCENT-GLODE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "3.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.72", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.97", "rCommAbility": "3.03", "rInstructorQuality": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "CORPORATE VALUATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-207-002", "path": "/courses/27427/sections/002", "id": "27427-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-207-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/27427/sections/002/reviews/5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "first_name": "VINCENT", "last_name": "GLODE", "id": "5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "name": "VINCENT GLODE"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "27427-002-5358-VINCENT-GLODE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.28", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "3.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82", "rReadingsValue": "2.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.94", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.95"}, "section": {"name": "CORPORATE VALUATION", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-207-003", "path": "/courses/27427/sections/003", "id": "27427-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-207-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/27427/sections/003/reviews/5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "first_name": "VINCENT", "last_name": "GLODE", "id": "5358-VINCENT-GLODE", "name": "VINCENT GLODE"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "27427-003-5358-VINCENT-GLODE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-207", "path": "/courses/27427", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27427/sections", "values": [{"name": "CORPORATE VALUATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-207-001", "path": "/courses/27427/sections/001", "id": "27427-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-207-001"]}, {"name": "CORPORATE VALUATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-207-002", "path": "/courses/27427/sections/002", "id": "27427-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-207-002"]}, {"name": "CORPORATE VALUATION", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-207-003", "path": "/courses/27427/sections/003", "id": "27427-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-207-003"]}]}, "id": 27427, "aliases": ["FNCE-207"]}
