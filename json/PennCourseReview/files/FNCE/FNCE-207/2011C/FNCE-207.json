However, some people thought he expected his students to have previous knowledge of corporate valuation and therefore was reluctant to answer questions in class.\r\n\r\nAlmost all students thought the amount of coursework was very extensive, especially regarding group projects. The class required \"considerable commitment both in terms of time and ability,\" but was ultimately rewarding. Prerequisites include FNCE 100, ACCT 101, and STAT 101-111.
