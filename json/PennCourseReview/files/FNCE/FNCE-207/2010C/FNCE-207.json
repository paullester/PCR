The primary focus is on the valuation of equity in a public corporation, but the methods also apply to the valuation of private companies and small businesses.

Other topics covered include the estimation of cash flows and discount rates, application of value multiples, and additional valuation issues within the context of mergers and acquisitions, emerging markets, and intellectual property. \r\n\r\nMost students agreed that the material learned in this class was \u201cuseful\u201d and applicable to the real-world.
