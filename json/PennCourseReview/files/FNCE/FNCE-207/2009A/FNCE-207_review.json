Topics discussed include discounted cash flow techniques and valuation using alternative valuation techniques such as price multiples. Emphasis is on developing the required information for valuation from financial statements and other information sources.\r\n\r\nFNCE 207 introduces coursework that builds strongly on material learned in other classes. Students suggested seeking a FNCE 207 professor who challenges them in order to prevent a great deal of overlap from previous courses.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael Cichello has been described by students as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cengaging.\u201d However, Some found that he teaches FNCE 207 at too slow a pace and on too basic of a level. Others also mentioned that he relies too heavily on the textbook.\r\n\r\nMany students found this class too easy and the material too repetitive, with much of the content already learned in other classes. Some claim that the class was taught at an introductory level, unfit for Wharton students who generally have good foundations in finance. Exam grades frequently averaged above 90 percent.", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/15770/sections/001/reviews/4335-MICHAEL-CICHELLO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4335-MICHAEL-CICHELLO", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "CICHELLO", "id": "4335-MICHAEL-CICHELLO", "name": "MICHAEL CICHELLO"}, "num_reviewers": 74, "id": "15770-001-4335-MICHAEL-CICHELLO"}]
