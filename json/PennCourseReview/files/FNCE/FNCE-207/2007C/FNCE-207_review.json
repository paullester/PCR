Topics discussed include discounted cash flow techniques and valuation using alternative valuation techniques such as price multiples. Emphasis is on developing the required information for valuation from financial statements and other information sources.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the content of this course, one student believed that there were \u201cgreat, in-depth analyses of the topics\u201d and that \u201cthe bulk pack was great.\u201d Another student felt that FNCE-207 was \u201cmuch more accounting-heavy than first anticipated. The cases seem a bit more obscure and difficult than the material in class/tests.\u201d A third student felt that FNCE-207 \u201cteaches all of the aspects of Valuation, while pointing out what we will most likely use in practical settings.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs far as Professor Holthausen\u2019s teaching ability, one student felt that he was \u201cwonderful but speaks WAY too fast. Notes should be IN the slides.\u201d Another student thanked Professor Holthausen for a \u201cgreat\u201d semester and emphasized that \u201ca lot of effort clearly goes into preparing and teaching the material.\u201d Several students described Professor Holthausen as \u201cknowledgeable.\u201d  \r\n\r\nOne student felt that \u201cthe grading for the cases was unfair\u201d and that it was beyond \u201cthe extent of skills expected from undergraduates.\u201d As for the workload, another student felt that FNCE-207 was a \u201cvery challenging course with a huge syllabus. Great value in final learnings but a very intensive course.\u201d A third student felt that there was \u201can immense disconnect between the theory presented in the slides, the detailed accounting you are expected to decipher in the cases and exams, and the modeling methodology that you are essentially expected figure out on your own when doing cases.\u201d", "num_students": 81, "path": "/courses/13275/sections/001/reviews/1431-ROBERT-W--HOLTHAUSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1431-ROBERT-W--HOLTHAUSEN", "first_name": "ROBERT W.", "last_name": "HOLTHAUSEN", "id": "1431-ROBERT-W--HOLTHAUSEN", "name": "ROBERT W.
