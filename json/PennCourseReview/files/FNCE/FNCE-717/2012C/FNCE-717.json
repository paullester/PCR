{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4250"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options, empirical evidence, strategies with respect to these assets, dynamic asset allocation strategies, or which portfolio insurance is an example, swaps, and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28972/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "3.22", "rStimulateInterest": "2.22", "rRecommendMajor": "2.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-717-001", "path": "/courses/28972/sections/001", "id": "28972-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-717-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/28972/sections/001/reviews/4339-PHILIPP-K--ILLEDITSCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4339-PHILIPP-K--ILLEDITSCH", "first_name": "PHILIPP K.", "last_name": "ILLEDITSCH", "id": "4339-PHILIPP-K--ILLEDITSCH", "name": "PHILIPP K.
