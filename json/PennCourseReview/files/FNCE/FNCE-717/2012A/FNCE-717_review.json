In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options.\r\nPrerequisites: FNCE 601, FNCE 602, STAT 621 (these courses may not be taken concurrently).\r\nStudents remarked that this was \u201cthe most challenging, satisfying course\u201d at Wharton and enjoyed the class.\r\nProfessor Gibbons \u201cis an exceptional instructor and his coursepack is fantastic.\u201d\r\nThis course is \u201ca necessity\u201d for finance majors and students felt that it \u201cshould be a required course for your MBA.\u201d The exams and problem sets are difficult and the \u201cmaterial is tough, tedious, and frustrating\u201d for students with no previous experience with derivatives.\r\n", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/27439/sections/701/reviews/4340-MICHAEL-R-GIBBONS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4340-MICHAEL-R-GIBBONS", "first_name": "MICHAEL R", "last_name": "GIBBONS", "id": "4340-MICHAEL-R-GIBBONS", "name": "MICHAEL R GIBBONS"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "27439-701-4340-MICHAEL-R-GIBBONS"}]
