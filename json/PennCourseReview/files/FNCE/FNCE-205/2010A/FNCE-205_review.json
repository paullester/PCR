The course discusses principles for managing financial assets. These principles apply, for example, to managing corporate pension funds, bank-administered trusts, and other institutional funds. Students will learn how to establish appropriate investment objectives, develop optimal portfolio strategies, estimate risk-return tradeoffs, and evaluate investment performance. Many of the latest quantitative approaches are discussed. The prerequisites are FNCE100, FNCE101, STAT101 and STAT102.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course to be very interesting, but \u201cheavy on financial theory.\u201d They stressed that the course provides an excellent and very important base on theoretical knowledge, but little real world application. There is also a heavy emphasis on statistics work.\r\n\r\nMany students had praise for Professor Geczy as an \u201cincredibly smart\u201d teacher. He is very approachable and happy to answer questions in an \u201carticulate matter [sic].\u201d One student explained that Professor Geczy \"is a great lecturer and is able to explain complicated/abstract material in a way that is easy to follow.\u201d However, a main complaint was the Professor's frequent absence from class. The Professor had to reschedule lecture four to five times throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nThe course has homework assignments which have been called \u201cchallenging,\u201d while the exams were \u201cusual fare\u201d at Penn.", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/26060/sections/001/reviews/516-CHRISTOPHER-C--GECZY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/516-CHRISTOPHER-C--GECZY", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER C.", "last_name": "GECZY", "id": "516-CHRISTOPHER-C--GECZY", "name": "CHRISTOPHER C.
