The first part of the course examines issues related to the international markets.  The second part of the course considers financial issues associated with the operation of a firm in the international environment. While the course discusses theoretical basis on the various issues, it relies on both empirical evidence and discussion of firms' real world activities.  The course style is mostly lectures with some class discussions.  It evaluates students through several quantitative problem sets, case studies, and a midterm and end of course exam. \r\n\r\nOverall, students thought this was a \u201csuperb course\u201d and one that was \u201cfull of learning.\u201d Students learned a wealth of information on \u201chow to handle international finance\u201d and found that this complemented Corporate Finance and Advanced Corporate Finance, without overlapping. \r\n\r\nStudents raved about Professor Bodbar\u2019s ability to make a \u201cvery dry subject very interesting.\u201d They found him \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d and \u201cpassionate about the subject.\u201d Students enjoyed the way Professor Bodnar brought real world knowledge and situations to the classroom. One student praised the way Professor Bodnar \u201ctreated the students as learners and professionals\u201d and said that he \u201cchallenged us to learn, but in a way that encouraged learning.\u201d Several students called Professor Bodnar one of the best professors they have had at Wharton.\r\n\r\nThough students raved about the overall course, many complained about the large amount of work assigned, warning that students who do not keep up are \u201cfried during the exam.\u201d Students also reported that those who are slower with mathematical computations are at a \u201cdistinct disadvantage in the exams, as the time constraint is significant.\u201d They suggested that these issues would be resolved if a problem set was cut or if there was \u201cmore formal TA-led drilling or support.\u201d\r\n\r\n*This review is based on only 7 student comments\r\n", "num_students": 54, "path": "/courses/24441/sections/701/reviews/5215-GORDON-M--BODNAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5215-GORDON-M--BODNAR", "first_name": "GORDON M.", "last_name": "BODNAR", "id": "5215-GORDON-M--BODNAR", "name": "GORDON M.
