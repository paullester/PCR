{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5539"}, "description": "The course will cover a variety of microeconometic models and methods including panel data models, program evaluation methods [e.g. difference in differences, matching techniques, regression discontinuity design] instrumental variables, duration models, structural estimation [e.g. simulated methods of moments]. The structure of the course consists of lectures, student presentations, and empirical exercises. I will utilize published studies in a variety of fields such as corporate finance, labor economics and industrial organization to illustrate the various techniques. The goal of the course is to provide students with a working knowledge of various econometric techniques that they can apply in their own research. As such, the emphasis of the course is on applications, not theory. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "EMPIRICAL METH CORP FN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28984/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.85", "rDifficulty": "2.62", "rStimulateInterest": "3.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.92", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.54", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "EMPIRICAL METH CORP FN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-926-001", "path": "/courses/28984/sections/001", "id": "28984-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-926-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/28984/sections/001/reviews/5617-TODD-A--GORMLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5617-TODD-A--GORMLEY", "first_name": "TODD A.", "last_name": "GORMLEY", "id": "5617-TODD-A--GORMLEY", "name": "TODD A.
