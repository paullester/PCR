The microeconomic portion introduces the discipline and fundamental tools of economics. It proceeds to study the workings of a price system and theories of consumer and firm decision-making. It further analyzes particular market structures characterized by perfect and imperfect competition, reviews the strengths and weaknesses of a market economy, and considers the government's role in correcting market failures and promoting competition. The macroeconomic portion studies the domestic and international forces that govern the determination of the aggregate level of economic activity, and pays particular attention to the determinants of long-run economic growth and stabilization policies used to dampen business cycles. The course concludes with global issues including the determinants of trade, trade policy, capital mobility, international financial instability, and international economic integration and the extent of globalization. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "BUSINESS ECONOMICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28957/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.97", "rDifficulty": "3.10", "rStimulateInterest": "2.87", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "BUSINESS ECONOMICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNCE-103-301", "path": "/courses/28957/sections/301", "id": "28957-301", "aliases": ["FNCE-103-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/28957/sections/301/reviews/1427-MARTIN-A--ASHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1427-MARTIN-A--ASHER", "first_name": "MARTIN A.", "last_name": "ASHER", "id": "1427-MARTIN-A--ASHER", "name": "MARTIN A.
