The course reviews the theory and empirical evidence related to the investment and financing policies of the firm and attempts to develop decision-making ability in these areas. FNCE 203 serves as an extension of FNCE 100. Some areas of financial management not covered in FNCE 100 are covered in FNCE 203. These may include leasing, mergers and acquisitions, corporate reorganizations, financial planning and working capital management, and some other selected topics. Other areas that are covered in FNCE 100 are covered more in depth and more rigorously in FNCE 203. These include investment decision making under uncertainty, cost of capital, capital structure, pricing of selected financial instruments and corporate liabilities, and dividend policy. \r\n\r\nStudent reviews on this course was very mixed, but tended to be more negative than positive. While some students stated that the case component of the course \u201ctakes a ton of time\u201d and that they were often \u201cpretty lengthy projects,\u201d others believed that the cases \u201creally developed their modeling skills and improved understanding of Corporate Finance.\u201d Many students disliked the fact that cases due on the day of a quiz in essence double-penalized them for mistakes on the cases, because quizzes were based on the cases. \r\n\r\nProfessor Kihlstrom also received mixed reviews. While he was described as \u201ca great lecturer,\u201d students believed that the course was dry. They suggested that Professor Kihlstrom \u201ccould capture the students\u2019 attention better if he restructured his lectures in a way that would make his final figures easier to follow.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents described this course as \u201ccompetitive\u201d because of the many Finance concentrators in this course. Prerequisites for this course include FNCE 100, FNCE 101, STAT 101, and STAT 102. \r\n", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/24421/sections/001/reviews/2139-RICHARD-E-KIHLSTROM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2139-RICHARD-E-KIHLSTROM", "first_name": "RICHARD E", "last_name": "KIHLSTROM", "id": "2139-RICHARD-E-KIHLSTROM", "name": "RICHARD E KIHLSTROM"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "24421-001-2139-RICHARD-E-KIHLSTROM"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "3.02", "rStimulateInterest": "1.53", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "3.58", "rInstructorAccess": "2.62", "rReadingsValue": "1.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "2.02", "rInstructorQuality": "2.09"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-002", "path": "/courses/24421/sections/002", "id": "24421-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-002"]}, "comments": "Finance 203 studies the major decision-making areas of managerial finance and some selected topics in financial theory.
