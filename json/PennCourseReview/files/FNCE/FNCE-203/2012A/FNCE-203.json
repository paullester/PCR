{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/481"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to study the major decision-making areas of managerial finance and some selected topics in financial theory. The course reviews the theory and empirical evidence related to the investment and financing policies of the firm and attempts to develop decision-making ability in these areas. This course serves as an extension of FNCE 100. Some areas of financial management not covered in FNCE 100 are covered in FNCE 203. These may include leasing, mergers and acquisitions, corporate reorganizations, financial planning and working capital management, and some other selected topics. Other areas that are covered in FNCE 100 are covered more in depth and more rigorously in FNCE 203. These include investment decision making under uncertainty, cost of capital, capital structure, pricing of selected financial instruments and corporate liabilities, and dividend policy. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27424/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.18", "rRecommendMajor": "3.16", "rCourseQuality": "2.56", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "2.65", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.80", "rCommAbility": "2.69", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-001", "path": "/courses/27424/sections/001", "id": "27424-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-001"]}, "comments": "The objective of FNCE 203 is to study the major decision-making areas of managerial finance and some selected topics in financial theory.

Furthermore, each case took a long time to complete, but provided great practice examples for concepts learned in class. Ultimately, this course was described as very useful for students who want to enter the financial service industry.\r\n\tThe students were largely upset about the lack of guidance from the course TAs for cases. The grading was very subjective and the grading was not uniform. However, Professor Opp was described as very approachable and accessible. Unfortunately, a few students noted that the professor would often \u201cread off the slides,\u201d losing the interest of many.\r\n\tMany students recommend the class to finance majors, but and one student stated, \u201cnon-majors will get little out of it.\u201d Students felt that the material learned during class was very conceptual but the case assignments and exams were largely quantitative. Prerequisites include FNCE 100, FNCE 101, STAT 101, and STAT 102.\r\n", "num_students": 69, "path": "/courses/27424/sections/001/reviews/5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "first_name": "CHRISTIAN", "last_name": "OPP", "id": "5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "name": "CHRISTIAN OPP"}, "num_reviewers": 62, "id": "27424-001-5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "2.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.47", "rInstructorAccess": "2.76", "rReadingsValue": "1.97", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.76"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-002", "path": "/courses/27424/sections/002", "id": "27424-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/27424/sections/002/reviews/5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "first_name": "CHRISTIAN", "last_name": "OPP", "id": "5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "name": "CHRISTIAN OPP"}, "num_reviewers": 41, "id": "27424-002-5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-003", "path": "/courses/27424/sections/003", "id": "27424-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/27424/sections/003/reviews/5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "first_name": "CHRISTIAN", "last_name": "OPP", "id": "5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP", "name": "CHRISTIAN OPP"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "27424-003-5357-CHRISTIAN-OPP"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-203", "path": "/courses/27424", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27424/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-001", "path": "/courses/27424/sections/001", "id": "27424-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-001"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-002", "path": "/courses/27424/sections/002", "id": "27424-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-002"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-003", "path": "/courses/27424/sections/003", "id": "27424-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-003"]}]}, "id": 27424, "aliases": ["FNCE-203"]}
