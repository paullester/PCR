{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/481"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to study the major decision-making areas of managerial finance and some selected topics in financial theory. The course reviews the theory and empirical evidence related to the investment and financing policies of the firm and attempts to develop decision-making ability in these areas. This course serves as an extension of FNCE 100. Some areas of financial management not covered in FNCE 100 are covered in FNCE 203. These may include leasing, mergers and acquisitions, corporate reorganizations, financial planning and working capital management, and some other selected topics. Other areas that are covered in FNCE 100 are covered more in depth and more rigorously in FNCE 203. These include investment decision making under uncertainty, cost of capital, capital structure, pricing of selected financial instruments and corporate liabilities, and dividend policy. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6555/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.82", "rStimulateInterest": "2.55", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.55", "rCommAbility": "2.45", "rInstructorQuality": "2.55"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-001", "path": "/courses/6555/sections/001", "id": "6555-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/6555/sections/001/reviews/515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "first_name": "HULYA", "last_name": "ERASLAN", "id": "515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "name": "HULYA ERASLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "6555-001-515-HULYA-ERASLAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.54", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "1.88", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.87", "rInstructorAccess": "3.04", "rReadingsValue": "2.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.92", "rCommAbility": "1.83", "rInstructorQuality": "2.21"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-002", "path": "/courses/6555/sections/002", "id": "6555-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/6555/sections/002/reviews/515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "first_name": "HULYA", "last_name": "ERASLAN", "id": "515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "name": "HULYA ERASLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "6555-002-515-HULYA-ERASLAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.59", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "1.82", "rRecommendMajor": "2.95", "rCourseQuality": "2.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "1.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.27", "rCommAbility": "2.18", "rInstructorQuality": "2.09"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-003", "path": "/courses/6555/sections/003", "id": "6555-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/6555/sections/003/reviews/515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "first_name": "HULYA", "last_name": "ERASLAN", "id": "515-HULYA-ERASLAN", "name": "HULYA ERASLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "6555-003-515-HULYA-ERASLAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-203", "path": "/courses/6555", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6555/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-001", "path": "/courses/6555/sections/001", "id": "6555-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-001"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-002", "path": "/courses/6555/sections/002", "id": "6555-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-002"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CORP FINANCE", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-203-003", "path": "/courses/6555/sections/003", "id": "6555-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-203-003"]}]}, "id": 6555, "aliases": ["FNCE-203"]}
