{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5540"}, "description": "This doctoral level course introduces students to game theory and continuous-time methods. Both techniques represent fundamental approaches to organizing, modeling and understanding complex financial phenomena. The game theory half will cover equilibrium concepts, moral hazard, signaling and screening. Highlights include rigorous formulations and analyses of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium concept and the principal-agent relationship. Both ideas are central to theories of corporate finance and financial markets - subjects that the students willbe exposed to in the spring. The continuous-time methods half will cover basic stochastic calculus and applications to capital structure, Merton's consumption-portfolio and problem and optimal contracts. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "METHODS IN FNCE THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28985/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.08", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "0.92", "rRecommendMajor": "1.00", "rCourseQuality": "0.92", "rWorkRequired": "3.45", "rInstructorAccess": "1.42", "rReadingsValue": "1.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.50", "rCommAbility": "1.92", "rInstructorQuality": "1.33"}, "section": {"name": "METHODS IN FNCE THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-928-001", "path": "/courses/28985/sections/001", "id": "28985-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-928-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/28985/sections/001/reviews/6099-JOHN-Y--ZHU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6099-JOHN-Y--ZHU", "first_name": "JOHN Y.", "last_name": "ZHU", "id": "6099-JOHN-Y--ZHU", "name": "JOHN Y.
