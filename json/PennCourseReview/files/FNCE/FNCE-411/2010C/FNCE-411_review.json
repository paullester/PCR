In this course on monetary economics, students learn how financial markets work and how government policies affect the business environment. The goal is to provide a unified framework for understanding macroeconomic events and policy, paying attention to the interdependence of business, banking institutions, government, and the public in determining the performance of the economy. While focused on the U.S. economy, international aspects such as trade and exchange rates are also considered. This course is appropriate for everyone who holds, or aspires to, a position where big-picture thinking and decision making is required. This course is for WPWP certificate students only. \r\n\r\nStudents found the course content to be \u201cvery relevant to one\u2019s life.\u201d Students reported learning a lot of practical and relevant material in this class, though all agreed that an excessive amount of material was covered. Required reading was often overwhelming, especially since lectures did not always correspond to outside reading material. Whereas one student found the class to be \u201cone of the best courses I took at Wharton,\u201d some complained that the class was unnecessary and a waste, as much of the learning was done with external sources outside of the classroom. \r\n\r\nStudents praised Professor Thomas as being \u201cvery knowledgeable\u201d and an engaging lecturer. One student commented that Professor Thomas was \u201ccapable of communicating information in an excellent manner.\u201d Since he included much outside information in his lectures, students appreciated that \u201cthe class wasn\u2019t a class where the teacher reads out a textbook.\u201d Students found Professor Thomas to be approachable and accessible for students seeking assistance and advice. One student called Professor Thomas a \u201ctruly wonderful professor\u201d, and students felt privileged to have been taught by him.\r\n\r\nMany of the students in the class complained about the difficulty and amount of required reading outside the classroom. Students agreed that a great amount of work, effort, and time was required in order to succeed in the course. One student stated that \u201cthis one course is consuming an abnormal amount of time\u201d compared to other courses. Students further complained about the difficult format of the exams, especially the \u201cfill in the blank\u201d questions. \r\n", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/23096/sections/001/reviews/1421-KENNETH-H-THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1421-KENNETH-H-THOMAS", "first_name": "KENNETH H", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "1421-KENNETH-H-THOMAS", "name": "KENNETH H THOMAS"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "23096-001-1421-KENNETH-H-THOMAS"}]
