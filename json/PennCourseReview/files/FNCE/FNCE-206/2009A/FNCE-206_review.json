In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in a rapidly changing environment, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options.\r\n\r\nMost students find FNCE 206 extremely difficult. The course is certainly not for the faint-of-heart, and requires significant knowledge of finance and math. Course concepts are high level and in-depth. Many wish that the class would \u201cdumb down\u201d and be more geared toward students without prior knowledge. Those pursuing a career in trading will find the class especially interesting.

Some find them confusing but nonetheless highly informative and insightful. Students advised that attending office hours is a must.", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/15769/sections/001/reviews/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "first_name": "KRISHNA", "last_name": "RAMASWAMY", "id": "1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "name": "KRISHNA RAMASWAMY"}, "num_reviewers": 64, "id": "15769-001-1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY"}]
