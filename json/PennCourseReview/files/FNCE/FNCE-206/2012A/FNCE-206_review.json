In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options.\r\n\r\nMost students commented that \u201cthe conceptual and practical aspects of the class were well managed.\u201d Students found the cases to be \u201cinformative,\u201d but not as useful as other class material. One student commented that a more \u201cacademic treatment\u201d of derivatives may have been helpful. Many students commented that FNCE 206 was the \u201cmost valuable\u201d course they have taken at Penn.\r\n\r\nMost comments regarding Professor Ramaswamy were positive. Consistent with the sentiment of most students, one student said, \u201cProfessor Ramaswamy did a great job communicating the course concepts and bringing our attention to nuanced issues dealing with financial derivatives.\u201d Other students commented that Professor Ramaswamy was \u201calways willing to accommodate questions.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, students found this course to be worthwhile but \u201cdifficult\u201d because the pace was \u201ctoo fast\u201d and exams were hard. FNCE 206 has no prerequisites; however, FNCE 101 and STAT 102 are recommended and can be taken concurrently. \r\n", "num_students": 79, "path": "/courses/27426/sections/001/reviews/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "first_name": "KRISHNA", "last_name": "RAMASWAMY", "id": "1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "name": "KRISHNA RAMASWAMY"}, "num_reviewers": 68, "id": "27426-001-1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY"}]
