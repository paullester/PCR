{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/483"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28960/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.96", "rStimulateInterest": "2.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.52", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.19", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/28960/sections/001", "id": "28960-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 63, "path": "/courses/28960/sections/001/reviews/4339-PHILIPP-K--ILLEDITSCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4339-PHILIPP-K--ILLEDITSCH", "first_name": "PHILIPP K.", "last_name": "ILLEDITSCH", "id": "4339-PHILIPP-K--ILLEDITSCH", "name": "PHILIPP K.
