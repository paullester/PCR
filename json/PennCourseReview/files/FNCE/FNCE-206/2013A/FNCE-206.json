{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/483"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30317/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.03", "rDifficulty": "3.32", "rTAQuality": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.82", "rInstructorAccess": "2.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.70", "rCommAbility": "2.41", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/30317/sections/001", "id": "30317-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/30317/sections/001/reviews/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "first_name": "KRISHNA", "last_name": "RAMASWAMY", "id": "1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "name": "KRISHNA RAMASWAMY"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "30317-001-1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "3.15", "rTAQuality": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "3.09", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.62", "rInstructorAccess": "2.72", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.74", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-002", "path": "/courses/30317/sections/002", "id": "30317-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/30317/sections/002/reviews/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "first_name": "KRISHNA", "last_name": "RAMASWAMY", "id": "1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "name": "KRISHNA RAMASWAMY"}, "num_reviewers": 48, "id": "30317-002-1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-206", "path": "/courses/30317", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30317/sections", "values": [{"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/30317/sections/001", "id": "30317-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}, {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-002", "path": "/courses/30317/sections/002", "id": "30317-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-002"]}]}, "id": 30317, "aliases": ["FNCE-206"]}
