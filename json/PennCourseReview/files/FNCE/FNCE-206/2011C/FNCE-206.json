{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/483"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24423/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.98", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.90", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/24423/sections/001", "id": "24423-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 71, "path": "/courses/24423/sections/001/reviews/5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN", "first_name": "STEPHAN", "last_name": "DIECKMANN", "id": "5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN", "name": "STEPHAN DIECKMANN"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "24423-001-5616-STEPHAN-DIECKMANN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-206", "path": "/courses/24423", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24423/sections", "values": [{"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/24423/sections/001", "id": "24423-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}]}, "id": 24423, "aliases": ["FNCE-206"]}
