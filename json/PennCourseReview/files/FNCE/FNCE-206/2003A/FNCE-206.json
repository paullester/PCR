{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/483"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1651/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.63", "rDifficulty": "3.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.26", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.68", "rCommAbility": "3.74", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-002", "path": "/courses/1651/sections/002", "id": "1651-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/1651/sections/002/reviews/1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "BRANDT", "id": "1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT", "name": "MICHAEL BRANDT"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "1651-002-1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.77", "rDifficulty": "3.61", "rStimulateInterest": "3.45", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.76", "rCommAbility": "3.74", "rInstructorQuality": "3.74"}, "section": {"name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-003", "path": "/courses/1651/sections/003", "id": "1651-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/1651/sections/003/reviews/1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "BRANDT", "id": "1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT", "name": "MICHAEL BRANDT"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "1651-003-1853-MICHAEL-BRANDT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-206", "path": "/courses/1651", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1651/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-002", "path": "/courses/1651/sections/002", "id": "1651-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-002"]}, {"name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-003", "path": "/courses/1651/sections/003", "id": "1651-003", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-003"]}]}, "id": 1651, "aliases": ["FNCE-206"]}
