{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/483"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21720/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "3.26", "rStimulateInterest": "2.93", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "2.52", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.85", "rCommAbility": "3.04", "rInstructorQuality": "3.03"}, "section": {"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/21720/sections/001", "id": "21720-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/21720/sections/001/reviews/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "first_name": "KRISHNA", "last_name": "RAMASWAMY", "id": "1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY", "name": "KRISHNA RAMASWAMY"}, "num_reviewers": 70, "id": "21720-001-1854-KRISHNA-RAMASWAMY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-206", "path": "/courses/21720", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21720/sections", "values": [{"name": "FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-001", "path": "/courses/21720/sections/001", "id": "21720-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-001"]}]}, "id": 21720, "aliases": ["FNCE-206"]}
