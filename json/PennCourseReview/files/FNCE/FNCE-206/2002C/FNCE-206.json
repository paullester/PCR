{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/483"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the necessary skills to value and to employ options, futures, and related financial contracts. In order to provide a useful treatment of these topics in an environment that is changing rather rapidly, it is necessary to stress the fundamentals and to explore the topics at a technical level. The topics that will be covered include the valuation of futures contracts on stock indices, on commodities and Treasury instruments; the valuation of options; empirical evidence; strategies with respect to these assets; dynamic asset allocation strategies, of which portfolio insurance is an example; swaps; and the use (and misuse) of derivatives in the context of corporate applications. One-third of the course will be devoted to futures, a third to options, and a third to their applications. Many of the applications will be sprinkled along with the coverage of futures and options. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2973/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "3.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rRecommendMajor": "3.81", "rCourseQuality": "3.79", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "2.96", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.98", "rCommAbility": "3.96", "rInstructorQuality": "3.94"}, "section": {"name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-002", "path": "/courses/2973/sections/002", "id": "2973-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/2973/sections/002/reviews/1430-KENNETH-A-KAVAJECZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1430-KENNETH-A-KAVAJECZ", "first_name": "KENNETH A", "last_name": "KAVAJECZ", "id": "1430-KENNETH-A-KAVAJECZ", "name": "KENNETH A KAVAJECZ"}, "num_reviewers": 52, "id": "2973-002-1430-KENNETH-A-KAVAJECZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-206", "path": "/courses/2973", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2973/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPECULATIVE MARKETS", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-206-002", "path": "/courses/2973/sections/002", "id": "2973-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-206-002"]}]}, "id": 2973, "aliases": ["FNCE-206"]}
