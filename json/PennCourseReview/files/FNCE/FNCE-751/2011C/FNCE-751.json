{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4571"}, "description": "The focus of this course is on buying (or acquiring controlling stakes in) firms. The main topics to be covered are mergers and friendly acquisitions, hostile takeovers and buyouts. Using case studies, the course surveys the drivers of success in the transactions. While issues regarding motive and strategy will be discussed, financial theory would be the main lens used to view these control acquiring transactions. This will allow students to (1) evaluate transactions through valuation approaches and (2) structure deals employing financial innovation as a response to legal framework and economic frictions. This course should be of interest to students interested in pursuing careers as private equity investors, advisors in investment banking and corporate managers that deal with these issues. This course will be demanding and assumes familiarity with valuation analysis. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "FNCE OF BUYOUTS & ACQS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24445/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.36", "rDifficulty": "2.52", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.97", "rCourseQuality": "2.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.39", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.03", "rCommAbility": "2.58", "rInstructorQuality": "2.22"}, "section": {"name": "FNCE OF BUYOUTS & ACQS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-751-001", "path": "/courses/24445/sections/001", "id": "24445-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-751-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/24445/sections/001/reviews/3968-PAVEL-G--SAVOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3968-PAVEL-G--SAVOR", "first_name": "PAVEL G.", "last_name": "SAVOR", "id": "3968-PAVEL-G--SAVOR", "name": "PAVEL G.
