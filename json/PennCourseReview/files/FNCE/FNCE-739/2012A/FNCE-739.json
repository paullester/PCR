{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4956"}, "description": "There is an abundance of evidence suggesting that the standard economic paradigm - rational agents in an efficient market - does not adequately describe behavior in financial markets. In this course, we will survey the evidence and use psychology to guide alternative theories of financial markets. Along the way, we will address the standard argument that smart, profit-seeing agents can correct any distortions caused by irrational investors. Further, we will examine more closely the preferences and trading decisions of individual investors. We will argue that their systematic biases can aggregate into observed market inefficiencies. The second half of the course extends the analysis to corporate decision making. We then explore the evidence for both views in the context of capital structure, investment, dividend, and merger decisions. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27446/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.37", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "1.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.15", "rInstructorAccess": "2.55", "rReadingsValue": "2.68", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.45", "rCommAbility": "1.42", "rInstructorQuality": "1.58"}, "section": {"name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-739-001", "path": "/courses/27446/sections/001", "id": "27446-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-739-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/27446/sections/001/reviews/5361-YU-YUAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5361-YU-YUAN", "first_name": "YU", "last_name": "YUAN", "id": "5361-YU-YUAN", "name": "YU YUAN"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "27446-001-5361-YU-YUAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.71", "rDifficulty": "1.90", "rStimulateInterest": "1.37", "rRecommendMajor": "1.82", "rCourseQuality": "1.73", "rWorkRequired": "2.21", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "1.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.46", "rCommAbility": "1.21", "rInstructorQuality": "1.46"}, "section": {"name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-739-002", "path": "/courses/27446/sections/002", "id": "27446-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-739-002"]}, "comments": "In FNCE 739 students will survey the evidence and use psychology to guide alternative theories of financial markets.

Some students suggested that this difficulty may stem from a possible language barrier.\r\n\r\nMany students felt that grades in this course should not have been so strongly influenced by the hedge fund project. The prerequisites for this course include FNCE 611 or 612 and FNCE 613. FNCE 720 and FNCE 726 are recommended.\r\n", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/27446/sections/002/reviews/5361-YU-YUAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5361-YU-YUAN", "first_name": "YU", "last_name": "YUAN", "id": "5361-YU-YUAN", "name": "YU YUAN"}, "num_reviewers": 46, "id": "27446-002-5361-YU-YUAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-739", "path": "/courses/27446", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27446/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-739-001", "path": "/courses/27446/sections/001", "id": "27446-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-739-001"]}, {"name": "BEHAVIORAL FINANCE", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "FNCE-739-002", "path": "/courses/27446/sections/002", "id": "27446-002", "aliases": ["FNCE-739-002"]}]}, "id": 27446, "aliases": ["FNCE-739"]}
