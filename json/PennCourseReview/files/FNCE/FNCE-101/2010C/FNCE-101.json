{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/480"}, "description": "This is an intermediate-level course in macroeconomics and the global economy, including topics in monetary and international economics. The goal is to provide a unified framework for understanding macroeconomic events and policy, which govern the global economic environment of business. The course analyzes the determinants and behavior of employment, production, demand and profits; inflation, interest rates, asset prices, and wages; exchange rates and international flows of goods and assets; including the interaction of the real economy with monetary policy and the financial system. The analysis is applied to current events, both in the US and abroad. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MONETARY ECON & GLOB ECO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23084/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.27", "rDifficulty": "3.09", "rStimulateInterest": "1.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "1.64", "rReadingsValue": "1.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.73", "rCommAbility": "1.09", "rInstructorQuality": "1.50"}, "section": {"name": "MONETARY ECON & GLOB ECO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-101-001", "path": "/courses/23084/sections/001", "id": "23084-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-101-001"]}, "comments": "Monetary Economics and the Global Economy is an intermediate-level study of macroeconomics.
