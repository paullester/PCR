The goal is to provide a unified framework for understanding macroeconomic events and policy, which govern the global economic environment of business. The course analyzes the determinants and behavior of employment, production, demand and profits; inflation, interest rates, asset prices, and wages; exchange rates and international flows of goods and assets; including the interaction of the real economy with monetary policy and the financial system. The analysis is applied to current events, both in the US and abroad.\r\n\r\nThere was a consensus among students that the class material was more closely related to macroeconomics than finance, but they also agree that they did \u201clearn a lot about what was happening in the global economy.\u201d Some students thought that the course was \u201cdull\u201d or \u201cdry.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents remarked that Professor Hnatkovska did \u201ctry her best to communicate the material effectively.\u201d Students also remarked that Professor Hnatkovska \u201cdid an incredible job applying the course content to current events.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents said the tests \u201ccontained no surprises,\u201d but were sometimes too long to finish within the allotted time. Students remarked that concepts covered in BPUB, STAT, and ACCT were helpful for the course. The prerequisites include ECON 010 and MATH 104. It is part of the core requirements in Wharton.\r\n", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/24419/sections/003/reviews/5742-VIKTORIA-V--HNATKOVSKA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5742-VIKTORIA-V--HNATKOVSKA", "first_name": "VIKTORIA V.", "last_name": "HNATKOVSKA", "id": "5742-VIKTORIA-V--HNATKOVSKA", "name": "VIKTORIA V.
