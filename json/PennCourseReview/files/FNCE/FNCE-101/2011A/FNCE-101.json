{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/480"}, "description": "This is an intermediate-level course in macroeconomics and the global economy, including topics in monetary and international economics. The goal is to provide a unified framework for understanding macroeconomic events and policy, which govern the global economic environment of business. The course analyzes the determinants and behavior of employment, production, demand and profits; inflation, interest rates, asset prices, and wages; exchange rates and international flows of goods and assets; including the interaction of the real economy with monetary policy and the financial system. The analysis is applied to current events, both in the US and abroad. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MONETARY ECON & GLOB ECO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21717/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.84", "rDifficulty": "2.68", "rStimulateInterest": "0.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.52", "rCourseQuality": "1.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.88", "rCommAbility": "1.16", "rInstructorQuality": "1.38"}, "section": {"name": "MONETARY ECON & GLOB ECO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-101-001", "path": "/courses/21717/sections/001", "id": "21717-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-101-001"]}, "comments": "Finance 101 is an intermediate-level course in macroeconomics, including topics in international, monetary and financial economics. The goal of the course is to provide a coherent framework for analyzing macroeconomic events, such as business cycles (recessions and booms) and long-run growth, their impact on financial markets, and to discuss macroeconomic policy. The course is comprised of three major parts. The first part develops the foundations for goods, labor and capital markets.

In all parts of the course, the analysis will be applied to current economic events, both in the U.S. and abroad.
