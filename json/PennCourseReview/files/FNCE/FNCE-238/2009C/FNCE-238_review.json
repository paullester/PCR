The course focuses on: (1) the design of these securities (Why do bonds have embedded options? What is the role of preferred stock?); (2) the issuing process for these securities (What do investment banks do? Is the underwriting process important for the cost of capital?); (3) the pricing of these securities (How are credit risk in bonds and loans priced?) The securities covered include corporate and junk bonds, bank loans, common and preferred equity, commercial paper, securitization, as well as some recent innovations. Other topics include: the role of embedded options in corporate bonds; the role of bank and loan covenants; the function of bond rating agencies; exchange offers; prepackaged bankruptcies; bankruptcy in Chapter 11; workouts; debtor-in-possession financing; and pricing credit risk. The course is designed to be complementary to Advanced Corporate Finance and Fixed Income Securities.\r\n\r\nStudent opinion of this course was overwhelmingly positive.

Many believed that the information presented was highly relevant, interesting, and practical. According to one student, this course \u201cshould be a Wharton requirement,\u201d since the material \u201ccovers all the stuff that students out of a business school ought to know.\u201d \u201cThis has been my favorite finance course at Penn thus far,\u201d commented another student.\r\n\r\nPraise for Professor Musto was also considerable. Many found his teaching style agreeable, noting that he provided a variety of outside resources, was \u201cvery approachable,\u201d and \u201ccommunicated the subject matter in a manner that was immediately very clear to all students.\u201d Students repeatedly mentioned Professor Musto\u2019s broad knowledge of the course material as a strong positive of the class experience.\r\n\r\nStudents generally found the course load, required preparation, and exams manageable and fair. One student stated, \u201cI thought there was the proper amount of work between the homework, cases, and readings. The exams required you to think rather than just regurgitate facts, but were not impossible, either.\u201d \r\n", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/17376/sections/001/reviews/520-DAVID-K--MUSTO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/520-DAVID-K--MUSTO", "first_name": "DAVID K.", "last_name": "MUSTO", "id": "520-DAVID-K--MUSTO", "name": "DAVID K.
