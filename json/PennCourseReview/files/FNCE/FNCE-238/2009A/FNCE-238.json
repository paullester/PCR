Students noted that the lectures move quickly and cover a vast array of finance material. This course also becomes highly quantitative, straying into several topics on trading.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hauswald has been described by students as \u201centertaining,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d and \u201cincredibly knowledgeable.\u201d Many students appreciate the considerable effort he puts into the class and the vast quantity of information he introduces. Some, however, feel that he tries to pack too much material into each lecture.\r\n\r\nMost students find FNCE 738 extremely intense. The workload was described as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d It requires 5 cases, 6 homework assignments, and 2 exams. Though the challenge of FNCE 738 can seem daunting initially, most students who can manage it find it worthwhile and rewarding.", "num_students": 50, "path": "/courses/15773/sections/001/reviews/4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "first_name": "ROBERT", "last_name": "HAUSWALD", "id": "4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD", "name": "ROBERT HAUSWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 49, "id": "15773-001-4337-ROBERT-HAUSWALD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNCE-238", "path": "/courses/15773", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15773/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUNDING INVESTMENTS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "FNCE-238-001", "path": "/courses/15773/sections/001", "id": "15773-001", "aliases": ["FNCE-238-001"]}]}, "id": 15773, "aliases": ["FNCE-238"]}
