The concepts developed in Finance 100 form the foundation for all elective finance courses. The main topics covered include the time value of money and the net present value rule, valuation of bonds and stocks, principles of capital budgeting, uncertainty and the tradeoff between risk and return, corporate financing and dividend policy decisions, and capital budgeting decisions under uncertainty.\r\n\r\nStudents learned a great deal in this course. They reported learning skills that they would use both later in life, and in advanced finance classes. Though it was a difficult introductory course, it was primarily described as \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201cuseful.\u201d The class was more quantitative than theoretical, which some students disliked. \r\n\r\nOverall, students found Professor MacKinlay to be an \u201cexcellent\u201d instructor for this course. He was always willing to meet with students who had questions, and held review sessions that were invaluable for exams. Students appreciated the fact that he worked out problems on the board instead of using Power Point presentations, because it helped to \u201csee how a problem is worked out step-by-step.\u201d They found that this made it much easier to follow along, and made students \u201cmore motivated to go to class and copy down notes.\u201d Students also reported that Professor Mackinlay \u201censures that everyone understands every point\u201d so that they are prepared for exams.  As one student put it, \u201c if you take FNCE100, take it with Professor MacKinlay.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students in this class were in their sophomore year at the Wharton School, fulfilling the required business-fundamentals courses. Students reported that there was not much outside work, though the two homework assignments given were difficult. Most of the emphasis for the grading in this class lies on the tests, which test ability to adapt information learned in class to new details. Students recommended this class to \u201canyone interested at all in business,\u201d as they saw great practical value to this course. \r\n", "num_students": 140, "path":
