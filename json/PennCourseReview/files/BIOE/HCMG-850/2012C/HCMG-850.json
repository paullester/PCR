{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5544"}, "description": "This course will provide students a broad overview of the current U.S. healthcare system. The course will focus on the challenges facing the health care system, an in-depth understanding of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and of its potential impact upon health care access, delivery, cost, and quality as well as its effect on firms within the health care sector. The course will examine potential reforms, including those offered by liberals and conservatives and information that can be extracted from health care systems in other developed countries. \n\nThe course will also explore key facets of the ACA, including improving access to care and health insurance exchanges, improving quality and constraining costs through health care delivery system reforms, realigning capacity through changes in the health care workforce and in medical education, the potential impact on biomedical and other innovations, and the impact on economic outcomes such as employment, wage growth, and federal budget deficits. The course will also examine the political context and process of passing major legislation in general and health care legislation in particular, including constitutional arguments surrounding the Affordable Care Act. Throughout the course, the key lessons will integrate the disciplines of health economics, health and social policy, law and political science to elucidate key principles. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "HEALTH POLICY: HEALTH CARE REFORM AND THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN HEALTH SYSTEM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29053/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.49", "rDifficulty": "2.96", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.16", "rCommAbility": "2.65", "rInstructorQuality": "2.77"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH POLICY: HEALTH CARE REFORM AND THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN HEALTH SYSTEM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-850-401", "path": "/courses/29053/sections/401", "id": "29053-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-850-401", "HCMG-250-401", "BIOE-575-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 78, "path": "/courses/29053/sections/401/reviews/5764-J-SANFORD-SCHWARTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5764-J-SANFORD-SCHWARTZ", "first_name": "J SANFORD", "last_name": "SCHWARTZ", "id": "5764-J-SANFORD-SCHWARTZ", "name": "J SANFORD SCHWARTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "29053-401-5764-J-SANFORD-SCHWARTZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.49", "rDifficulty": "2.96", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "1.87", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.16", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.49"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH POLICY: HEALTH CARE REFORM AND THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN HEALTH SYSTEM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HCMG-850-401", "path": "/courses/29053/sections/401", "id": "29053-401", "aliases": ["HCMG-850-401", "HCMG-250-401", "BIOE-575-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 78, "path": "/courses/29053/sections/401/reviews/6290-EZEKIEL-J--EMANUEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6290-EZEKIEL-J--EMANUEL", "first_name": "EZEKIEL J.", "last_name": "EMANUEL", "id": "6290-EZEKIEL-J--EMANUEL", "name": "EZEKIEL J.
