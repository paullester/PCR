{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1368"}, "description": "One half of the course is devoted to the study of time series, including ARIMA modeling and forecasting. The other half studies modifications in random variables due to deductibles, co-payments, policy limits, and elements of simulation. This course is a possible entry point into the actuarial science program. No INSR course is a pre-requisite for INSR 831. The Society of Actuaries has approved INSR 831 for VEE credit on the topic of time series. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1807/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.05", "rDifficulty": "3.04", "rStimulateInterest": "1.74", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.61", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.09", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.41"}, "section": {"name": "APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "INSR-260-401", "path": "/courses/1807/sections/401", "id": "1807-401", "aliases": ["INSR-260-401", "INSR-831-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/1807/sections/401/reviews/1876-JOHN-DAVID-CUMMINS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1876-JOHN-DAVID-CUMMINS", "first_name": "JOHN DAVID", "last_name": "CUMMINS", "id": "1876-JOHN-DAVID-CUMMINS", "name": "JOHN DAVID CUMMINS"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "1807-401-1876-JOHN-DAVID-CUMMINS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "INSR-260", "path": "/courses/1807", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1807/sections", "values": [{"name": "APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "INSR-260-401", "path": "/courses/1807/sections/401", "id": "1807-401", "aliases": ["INSR-260-401", "INSR-831-401"]}]}, "id": 1807, "aliases": ["INSR-260", "INSR-831"]}
