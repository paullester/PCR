{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1944"}, "description": "This course covers models for insurer's losses, and applications of Markov chains. Poisson processes, including extensions such as non-homogeneous, compound, and mixed Poisson processes are studied in detail. The compound model is then used to establish the distribution of losses. An extensive section on Markov chains provides the theory to forecast future states of the process, as well as numerous applications of Markov chains to insurance, finance, and genetics. The course is abundantly illustrated by examples from the insurance and finance literature. While most of the students taking the course are future actuaries, other students interested in applications of statistics may discover in class many fascinating applications of stochastic processes and Markov chains. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "ACTUARIAL STATISTICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13434/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.93", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.79", "rCommAbility": "3.93", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ACTUARIAL STATISTICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "INSR-253-401", "path": "/courses/13434/sections/401", "id": "13434-401", "aliases": ["INSR-253-401", "INSR-833-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/13434/sections/401/reviews/675-JEAN-H--LEMAIRE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/675-JEAN-H--LEMAIRE", "first_name": "JEAN H.", "last_name": "LEMAIRE", "id": "675-JEAN-H--LEMAIRE", "name": "JEAN H.
