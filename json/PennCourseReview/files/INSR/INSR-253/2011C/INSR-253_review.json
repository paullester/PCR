The compound model is then used to establish the distribution of losses. An extensive section on Markov chains provides the theory to forecast future states of the process, as well as numerous applications of Markov chains to insurance, finance, and genetics. The course is abundantly illustrated by examples from the insurance and finance literature. \r\n\r\nSome students described the concepts in this course as complicated, yet they claimed that the superb teaching style of Professor Lemaire made them manageable.  The material covered is crucially relevant to a major and one student describes the content as a  \u201cgood complement\u201d to the other statistics classes taken in the past.  The second half of the course, according to another student, \u201cbrought better variety\u201d as far as content and research topics are concerned.\r\n\r\nA majority of students praised Professor Lemaire and his teaching style.  One student even claimed \u201cProfessor Lemaire is by far the best statistics professor at Penn,\u201d noting that \u201chis ability to communicate complicated concepts is excellent.\u201d  Another commended Professor Lemaire on his ability to incorporate his \u201cwealth of personal experience\u201d into presenting relevant material for the course.  A third mentioned that Professor Lemaire \u201creally does care about all of the students in his class and his actuarial program,\u201d attesting to the fact that he is the \u201cmain reason why the actuarial program at Penn is great.\u201d  Some students did note that there was sometimes a \u201clack of interaction with the class,\u201d but others lauded Professor Lemaire\u2019s ability to \u201ccommunicate complicated concepts.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile most of the students taking the course are future actuaries, other students interested in applications of statistics may discover many fascinating applications of stochastic processes and Markov chains in class.  It is highly recommended for those studying Insurance and Risk Management, which was recently merged with Business and Public Policy under the new department, Business Economics and Public Policy. Students believed that the course may be of interest to non-majors as well.  Students found the workload reasonable, and one student noted that the exams did require active studying but the \u201cexams themselves were not very tricky if effort was placed into learning the material.\u201d Pre-requisites include Math 104, Math 114, Stat 430, and Stat 431.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This review is based on only 4 student comments\r\n", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/24598/sections/401/reviews/675-JEAN-H--LEMAIRE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/675-JEAN-H--LEMAIRE", "first_name": "JEAN H.", "last_name": "LEMAIRE", "id": "675-JEAN-H--LEMAIRE", "name": "JEAN H.
