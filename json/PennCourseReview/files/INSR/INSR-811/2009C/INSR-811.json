{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4485"}, "description": "The success of any firm depends jointly on its ability to create value and on its ability to preserve value. The creation of value arises when a firm is able to identify and execute investments with a positive net present value. The creation of value invariably exposes the firm to risk and this value can easily be jeopardized. A fall in demand for its product, a sudden rise in production or financing costs, a technological failure, destruction of assets or information, a liability suit, or the activities of a rogue trader, each can squander the value created. In extreme cases these risky possibilities can bankrupt the firm. Risk management is becoming increasingly important and firms are devoting increasing time, attention and resources to deriving strategies for preserving value. These strategies include, hedging, insurance, contingent financing and changes in organizational design which make the firm more robust to shocks. Risk and Crisis Management will look at these and related strategies. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "RISK AND CRISIS MGMT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17551/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.59", "rWorkRequired": "1.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.41", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.45"}, "section": {"name": "RISK AND CRISIS MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "INSR-811-001", "path": "/courses/17551/sections/001", "id": "17551-001", "aliases": ["INSR-811-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/17551/sections/001/reviews/4380-JOAN-LAMM-TENNANT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4380-JOAN-LAMM-TENNANT", "first_name": "JOAN", "last_name": "LAMM-TENNANT", "id": "4380-JOAN-LAMM-TENNANT", "name": "JOAN LAMM-TENNANT"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "17551-001-4380-JOAN-LAMM-TENNANT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "INSR-811", "path": "/courses/17551", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17551/sections", "values": [{"name": "RISK AND CRISIS MGMT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "INSR-811-001", "path": "/courses/17551/sections/001", "id": "17551-001", "aliases": ["INSR-811-001"]}]}, "id": 17551, "aliases": ["INSR-811"]}
