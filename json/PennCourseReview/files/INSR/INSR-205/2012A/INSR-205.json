{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/640"}, "description": "This course describes the concepts and techniques available to corporations, non-profit organizations, and other organizations in their efforts to manage pure risks. The costs associated with such pure risks as product liability, environmental impairments, property losses, work-related injuries, and employee benefits (e.g., pensions, health insurance, etc.) affect the daily management of organizations. Managers who make decisions without appropriate consideration of risk management issues can jeopardize the long-term survival of their organizations. The course examines a common set of techniques which can be used by managers in dealing with these problems, including risk assumption, prevention, diversification, and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. In turn, students learn to recognize that the institutional structure of the organization itself influence its own risks and their corresponding treatments. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "RISK MANAGEMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27609/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.79", "rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "2.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "1.97", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.32", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.14", "rCommAbility": "3.21", "rInstructorQuality": "3.05"}, "section": {"name": "RISK MANAGEMENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "INSR-205-401", "path": "/courses/27609/sections/401", "id": "27609-401", "aliases": ["INSR-205-401", "INSR-805-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/27609/sections/401/reviews/3991-GREGORY-P--NINI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3991-GREGORY-P--NINI", "first_name": "GREGORY P.", "last_name": "NINI", "id": "3991-GREGORY-P--NINI", "name": "GREGORY P.

The course explores how individuals and firms assess and evaluate risk, the tools available to successfully manage risk, and real-world frictions that limit the amount of risk-sharing in the economy. The class will focus on pure risks that are relevant for individuals and firms, such as mortality and health-related expenses, property damage, product liability, and employee benefits (e.g. pensions). The course examines a common set of techniques that can be used by individuals and managers in dealing with risk, including risk assumption, prevention, diversification, and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. The focus is primarily on explaining the products and institutions that are seen in the world, which will prepare students for making decisions in their future careers and lives.\r\nThis course was a \u201cpretty good introduction to risk.\u201d Most students found the second module taught by Professor Gottlieb to be much more interesting that the first. The first module was centered around statistics, while the second was on insurance markets.\r\nProfessor Gottlieb \u201cmay come off as boring at times,\u201d especially during the first module since most students have taken statistics. The second module \u201cmore accurately reflected his ability and desire for teaching.  He provided extensive responses to student questions.\u201d\r\nWharton undergraduates are required to take either INSR205, now BEPP 305, or MGMT 104.
