Some commented that the course was very well split between qualitative and quantitative material.\r\n\r\nStudents agreed that Professor Gottlieb seemed \u201cto know the material well.\u201d He taught the second module, which covers various methods for mitigating or eliminating risks faced by both individuals and corporations.\r\n\r\nThe grade for the course is based on equally weighted averages of three exams. There are no formal prerequisites for this course although it is recommended that students have an introductory knowledge of statistics, microeconomics, and finance (STAT101, BPUB 250, and FNCE100).\r\n", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/23261/sections/404/reviews/5627-DANIEL-GOTTLIEB", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5627-DANIEL-GOTTLIEB", "first_name": "DANIEL", "last_name": "GOTTLIEB", "id": "5627-DANIEL-GOTTLIEB", "name": "DANIEL GOTTLIEB"}, "num_reviewers": 48, "id": "23261-404-5627-DANIEL-GOTTLIEB"}]
