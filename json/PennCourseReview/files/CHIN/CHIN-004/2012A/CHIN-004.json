{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3001"}, "description": "This course is the continuation of CHIN003. The primary goal of the course is to improve students' conversational ability in Chinese. By the end of the semester, students will reach the survival level, namely, they can accomplish the basic day to day tasks encountered by visitors as well as the local people. These tasks include relating one's personal life and experiences, expressing preference, feeling and opinion, ordering a meal, purchasing goods, asking directions, making travel plans, visiting a doctor, attending a social function and so forth. Short Chinese movies or television shows will be integrated into the course curriculum. Chinese character will not be taught. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "2ND YR SPOKEN CHINESE II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27112/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "3.33", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.00", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rInstructorConcern": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "4.00", "rOralSkills": "4.00", "rNativeAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "4.00", "rSkillEmphasis": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "2ND YR SPOKEN CHINESE II", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHIN-004-601", "path": "/courses/27112/sections/601", "id": "27112-601", "aliases": ["CHIN-004-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/27112/sections/601/reviews/35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH", "first_name": "MAIHENG SHEN", "last_name": "DIETRICH", "id": "35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH", "name": "MAIHENG SHEN DIETRICH"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "27112-601-35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHIN-004", "path": "/courses/27112", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27112/sections", "values": [{"name": "2ND YR SPOKEN CHINESE II", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHIN-004-601", "path": "/courses/27112/sections/601", "id": "27112-601", "aliases": ["CHIN-004-601"]}]}, "id": 27112, "aliases": ["CHIN-004"]}
