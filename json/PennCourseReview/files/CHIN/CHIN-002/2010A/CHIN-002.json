{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3000"}, "description": "A continuation of CHIN001, This course is to help students develop their listening and speaking skills. The emphasis is on correct pronunciation, accurate tones and mastery of basic grammatical structures. By the end of the semester, students will be able to manage many situations that have immediate concern to them, such as relating one's personal life and experiences, expressing preferences and feelings, ordering meals, purchasing goods, asking for directions. To achieve this goal, the class is to be conducted in Chinese as much as possible. Chinese characters will also be introduced, but will not be the focus of the class. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "1ST YR SPOKEN CHINESE II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25761/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.50", "rTAQuality": "2.50", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.63", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.50", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rInstructorConcern": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rClassPace": "2.25", "rExamsConsistent": "3.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rGradeFairness": "3.25", "rArticulateGoals": "3.63", "rOralSkills": "3.50", "rNativeAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rInstructorEffective": "3.25", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "1ST YR SPOKEN CHINESE II", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHIN-002-601", "path": "/courses/25761/sections/601", "id": "25761-601", "aliases": ["CHIN-002-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/25761/sections/601/reviews/35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH", "first_name": "MAIHENG SHEN", "last_name": "DIETRICH", "id": "35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH", "name": "MAIHENG SHEN DIETRICH"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "25761-601-35-MAIHENG-SHEN-DIETRICH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHIN-002", "path": "/courses/25761", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25761/sections", "values": [{"name": "1ST YR SPOKEN CHINESE II", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "CHIN-002-601", "path": "/courses/25761/sections/601", "id": "25761-601", "aliases": ["CHIN-002-601"]}]}, "id": 25761, "aliases": ["CHIN-002"]}
