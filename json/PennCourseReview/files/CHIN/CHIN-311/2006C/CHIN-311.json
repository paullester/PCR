{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3307"}, "description": "Students learn to work on materials which were written or produced for native speakers, instead of the classroom materials that were written for the non-native speakers. The reading materials include a larger vocabulary with more idioms. Students will also learn how to understand and use certain oral expressions in conversation. They will learn ways to narrate, to describe, and to comment in native Chinese ways. Reading and audio materials are provided and discussed in the classes. Writing and oral presentations in Chinese are required in classroom under instruction. Students will be encouraged to practice oral communication with each other. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "ADVANCED MOD CHINESE I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8663/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.67", "rTAQuality": "0.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.50", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.83", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rInstructorConcern": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rClassPace": "2.33", "rExamsConsistent": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rGradeFairness": "3.17", "rArticulateGoals": "3.83", "rOralSkills": "3.67", "rNativeAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rInstructorEffective": "3.67", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED MOD CHINESE I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHIN-311-001", "path": "/courses/8663/sections/001", "id": "8663-001", "aliases": ["CHIN-311-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/8663/sections/001/reviews/3239-LIWEI-JIAO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3239-LIWEI-JIAO", "first_name": "LIWEI", "last_name": "JIAO", "id": "3239-LIWEI-JIAO", "name": "LIWEI JIAO"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "8663-001-3239-LIWEI-JIAO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHIN-311", "path": "/courses/8663", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8663/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED MOD CHINESE I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHIN-311-001", "path": "/courses/8663/sections/001", "id": "8663-001", "aliases": ["CHIN-311-001"]}]}, "id": 8663, "aliases": ["CHIN-311"]}
