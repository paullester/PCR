{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1063"}, "description": "A course on statistical methods for social scientists, applying the general linear model (GLM. Students learn the logic and assumptions underlying the GLM and complete exercises that apply linear modeling techniques using the Stata statistical package to \"real-world\" data. Issues covered include the logic of statistical modeling, efficient estimation (i.e. statistical precision), specification errors (i.e. what happens when you make incorrect assumptions about how the world works), analyzing group differences with discrete (qualitative) variables (e.g. looking at differences in social processes by gender, or race), representing social processes with multiple equations (\"path analysis\"), and nonlinear relationships in linear models. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "QUANT METHODS II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28160/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.46", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.18", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.66", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.96", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.52", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "QUANT METHODS II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-536-401", "path": "/courses/28160/sections/401", "id": "28160-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-536-401", "DEMG-536-401"]}, "comments": "This class analyzes the statistical methods for social scientists by using the general linear model.
