{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5625"}, "description": "Many dimensions of firms' strategies, including agreements with suppliers and competitors, mergers and acquisitions, pricing, and technology standards development, among others, are subject to the oversight of regulatory bodies and governmental agencies. This course studies how public policy impacts firms' strategic choices in a host of economic environments. We will analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; the management of complementarities between products; the role of network effects and platform competition; and how firms can take advantage of the regulatory environment they operate in when making such decisions. We will study, for example, why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against the widely supported HD-DVD format; how the FCC plans to incentivize television broadcasters to return spectrum holdings for auction to wireless broadband providers; and how contracts with content providers affect firms' strategic interactions in the e-reader market. To understand how firm strategy and public policy interact, the course will rely on a mix of simple but rigorous analytical models and case studies. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "FIRMS, MARKETS & PUBLIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29927/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rTAQuality": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.37", "rRecommendMajor": "2.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.53", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.68", "rCommAbility": "2.84", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "FIRMS, MARKETS & PUBLIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BEPP-210-401", "path": "/courses/29927/sections/401", "id": "29927-401", "aliases": ["BEPP-210-401", "BEPP-710-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/29927/sections/401/reviews/2888-KATJA-SEIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2888-KATJA-SEIM", "first_name": "KATJA", "last_name": "SEIM", "id": "2888-KATJA-SEIM", "name": "KATJA SEIM"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "29927-401-2888-KATJA-SEIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BEPP-210", "path": "/courses/29927", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29927/sections", "values": [{"name": "FIRMS, MARKETS & PUBLIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BEPP-210-401", "path": "/courses/29927/sections/401", "id": "29927-401", "aliases": ["BEPP-210-401", "BEPP-710-401"]}]}, "id": 29927, "aliases": ["BEPP-210", "BEPP-710"]}
