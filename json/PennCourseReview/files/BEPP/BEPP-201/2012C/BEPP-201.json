{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5513"}, "description": "This course explores the economics and politics of public policy to provide an analytic framework for considering why, how, and with what success/failure government intervenes in a variety of policy areas. Particular attention will be paid to important policy issues relating to taxation, social security, low-income assistance, health insurance, education (both K-12 and higher ed), the environment, and government deficits. The costs and benefits of alternative policies will be explored along with the distribution of responsibilities between the federal, state and local governments. While the course will focus primarily on U.S. policies, the topics covered (e.g. tax reform, deficits versus austerity, etc.) are currently at the center of the policy debate in many other industrialized countries as well. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "POL ECON OF SOC POL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28592/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.69", "rRecommendMajor": "2.93", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.54", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.76", "rCommAbility": "3.28", "rInstructorQuality": "3.09"}, "section": {"name": "POL ECON OF SOC POL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BEPP-201-401", "path": "/courses/28592/sections/401", "id": "28592-401", "aliases": ["BEPP-201-401", "BEPP-770-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/28592/sections/401/reviews/6066-LAURENCE-S--SEIDMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6066-LAURENCE-S--SEIDMAN", "first_name": "LAURENCE S.", "last_name": "SEIDMAN", "id": "6066-LAURENCE-S--SEIDMAN", "name": "LAURENCE S.
