{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5628"}, "description": "Over the last several decades, energy markets have become some of the most dynamic markets of the world economy. Traditional fossil fuel and electricity markets have seen a partial shift from heavy regulation to market-driven incentives, while rising environmental concerns have led to a wide array of new regulations and \"environmental markets\". The growth of renewable energy could be another source of rapid change, but brings with it a whole new set of technological and policy challenges. This landscape requires quick adaptation from energy companies, but also offers opportunities to turn regulations into new business. The objective of this course is to provide students with the economist's perspective on a broad range of issues that professionals in the energy industry will encounter. The focus will be on business and public policy issues related to the recent changes in energy markets. Topics include the effect of competition, market power and scarcity on energy prices, the impact of deregulation on fossil fuel and electricity markets, extraction and pricing of oil and gas, the environmental impact and policies related to the energy sector, environmental cap-and-trade markets, the economics of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and recent developments in the transportation sector. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ENERGY MARKETS & POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29932/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "3.36", "rTAQuality": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "2.91", "rCourseQuality": "2.96", "rWorkRequired": "3.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.95", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "ENERGY MARKETS & POLICY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BEPP-762-001", "path": "/courses/29932/sections/001", "id": "29932-001", "aliases": ["BEPP-762-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/29932/sections/001/reviews/6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM", "first_name": "ARTHUR", "last_name": "VAN BENTHEM", "id": "6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM", "name": "ARTHUR VAN BENTHEM"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "29932-001-6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BEPP-762", "path": "/courses/29932", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29932/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENERGY MARKETS & POLICY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BEPP-762-001", "path": "/courses/29932/sections/001", "id": "29932-001", "aliases": ["BEPP-762-001"]}]}, "id": 29932, "aliases": ["BEPP-762"]}
