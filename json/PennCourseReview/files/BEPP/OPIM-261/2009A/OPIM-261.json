The course explores the role of techniques such as decision analysis, cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment and risk perception in structuring risk-management decisions. In addition to teaching students how to recognize the limitations of individuals in processing information, OPIM 261 examines policy tools such as risk communication, incentive systems, third party inspection, insurance and regulation in different problem contexts. The course is cross-listed with OPIM 761, BPUB 261, 761, 961, and ESE 567.\r\n\r\nSome students said that this course was informative and helped spark interest in risk analysis. Many commented that the course was generally a broad overview of various elements of public health risk. Students mentioned that a \u201cbetter connection needs to be drawn between public health risks and impacts on business.\u201d Some students also said the class was too theoretical.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kunreuther was said to be \u201cvery open and approachable.\u201d Many students mentioned that they were impressed with his expertise in the field. However, they also noted that his \u201cslides are always confusing, hard to read and irrelevant.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course was offered to both undergraduates and MBA students. Many commented that they did not appreciate the mix and would have preferred if it was taught separately for the two classes of students. One student also mentioned that OPIM 261 is a \u201cgreat course especially for environmental studies majors looking into consulting.\u201d Students commented that there was an \u201cunnecessary amount of graded assignments throughout the semester.\u201d Grading was said to be highly subjective.", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/16270/sections/401/reviews/1657-HOWARD-KUNREUTHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1657-HOWARD-KUNREUTHER", "first_name": "HOWARD", "last_name": "KUNREUTHER", "id": "1657-HOWARD-KUNREUTHER", "name": "HOWARD KUNREUTHER"}, "num_reviewers": 55, "id": "16270-401-1657-HOWARD-KUNREUTHER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-261", "path": "/courses/16270", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16270/sections", "values": [{"name": "RISK ANALY & ENV MGMT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-261-401", "path": "/courses/16270/sections/401", "id": "16270-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-261-401", "ESE-567-401", "OPIM-761-401", "BPUB-961-401", "BPUB-761-401", "BPUB-261-401"]}]}, "id": 16270, "aliases": ["OPIM-261", "ESE-567", "OPIM-761", "BPUB-961", "BPUB-761", "BPUB-261"]}
