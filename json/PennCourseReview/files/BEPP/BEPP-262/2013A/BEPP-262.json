{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5627"}, "description": "This course examines environmental and energy issues from an economist's perspective. We start by analyzing sources of environmental problems, and how policy makers can intervene to solve some of these problems. We talk about the economic rationale for a broad range of possible policies: environmental taxes, subsidies, and cap-and-trade. In doing so, we discuss fundamental concepts in environmental economics, such as externalities, valuation of the environment and cost-benefit analysis. We then shift gears to topics from energy and natural resource economics. Over the last several decades, energy markets have become some of the most dynamic markets of the world economy, as they experienced a shift from heavy regulation to market-driven incentives. First, we look at scarcity pricing and market power in electricity and gasoline markets. We then study optimal extraction and pricing of both depletable (e.g., oil) and renewable (e.g., fisheries) natural resources. There will be special attention for the economics of renewable energy and policies to foster its growth. Finally, we discuss the transportation sector, and analyze heavily debated policies such as fuel-economy standards and subsidies for green vehicles. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ENVIRON. & ENERGY ECON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29930/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "3.27", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "ENVIRON. & ENERGY ECON", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BEPP-262-001", "path": "/courses/29930/sections/001", "id": "29930-001", "aliases": ["BEPP-262-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/29930/sections/001/reviews/6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM", "first_name": "ARTHUR", "last_name": "VAN BENTHEM", "id": "6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM", "name": "ARTHUR VAN BENTHEM"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "29930-001-6463-ARTHUR-VAN-BENTHEM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BEPP-262", "path": "/courses/29930", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29930/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENVIRON. & ENERGY ECON", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BEPP-262-001", "path": "/courses/29930/sections/001", "id": "29930-001", "aliases": ["BEPP-262-001"]}]}, "id": 29930, "aliases": ["BEPP-262"]}
