{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4663"}, "description": "Are you an entrepreneur? This half semester mini-course exposes MBA students (and approved undergraduates to this question). In addition, it evaluates entrepreneurial opportunities, structures, investment decision making, and risks which are present in commercial real estate markets. This course focuses on identifying realistic opportunities, how to develop the concept, identifying and mitigating risks, raising capital, and exiting. But most importantly, it allows for self-evaluation of the student's entrepreneurial tendencies. \n\nThe course consists of lectures by the professor, case discussions, and guest lectures by leading entrepreneurs. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "REAL ESTATE ENTREPRENEUR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18013/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.23", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.08", "rCourseQuality": "2.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "2.15", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.69", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.85"}, "section": {"name": "REAL ESTATE ENTREPRENEUR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "REAL-891-401", "path": "/courses/18013/sections/401", "id": "18013-401", "aliases": ["REAL-891-401", "REAL-396-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/18013/sections/401/reviews/1697-PETER-D-LINNEMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1697-PETER-D-LINNEMAN", "first_name": "PETER D", "last_name": "LINNEMAN", "id": "1697-PETER-D-LINNEMAN", "name": "PETER D LINNEMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "18013-401-1697-PETER-D-LINNEMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "REAL-891", "path": "/courses/18013", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18013/sections", "values": [{"name": "REAL ESTATE ENTREPRENEUR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "REAL-891-401", "path": "/courses/18013/sections/401", "id": "18013-401", "aliases": ["REAL-891-401", "REAL-396-401"]}]}, "id": 18013, "aliases": ["REAL-891", "REAL-396"]}
