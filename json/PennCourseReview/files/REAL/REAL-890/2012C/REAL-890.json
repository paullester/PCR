{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4662"}, "description": "As a truly non-U.S. focused course, we explore the world of cross-border real estate development, with a focus on fast growing emerging market economies. We examine the rational for international real estate investing and its challenges-including demographic, economic, transparency, taxation, subsidy, legal and political issues, the strategies of composing an international real estate portfolio, the macro and micro factors that will determine the performance of the investment, and the different investment formats suited to different international settings. International cases presented by practitioners are an integral part of the course. Cases have been selected to cover different types of real estate developments: residential, office, retail, hospitality, and logistics-important emerging market countries/continents, (East/South Asia, Latin America, Russia, SSAfrica) and different investment strategies. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INT'L REAL EST COMPARISN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29593/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.92", "rDifficulty": "1.88", "rStimulateInterest": "2.17", "rRecommendMajor": "2.38", "rCourseQuality": "2.04", "rWorkRequired": "2.04", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.42", "rCommAbility": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "2.21"}, "section": {"name": "INT'L REAL EST COMPARISN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "REAL-890-401", "path": "/courses/29593/sections/401", "id": "29593-401", "aliases": ["REAL-890-401", "REAL-390-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/29593/sections/401/reviews/3170-MARJA-C--HOEK-SMIT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3170-MARJA-C--HOEK-SMIT", "first_name": "MARJA C.", "last_name": "HOEK-SMIT", "id": "3170-MARJA-C--HOEK-SMIT", "name": "MARJA C.
