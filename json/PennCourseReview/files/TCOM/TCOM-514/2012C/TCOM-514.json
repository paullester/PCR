The topics continually evolve as new Web technologies and protocols emerge. The course starts with an overview of key Web software technologies (Web clients, Web proxies, Web servers, Web gateways and cookies) and a discussion of HTTP protocol design and its interaction with TCP/IP. The second part of the course concentrates on Next Generation Web, XML and its variants, Semantic Web, Web 2.0+, Web Services, and Web Based Architectures. The emphasis of this part is on emerging approaches to architect Web applications by using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The course concludes with a focus on Web-based integrated systems that merge real-time business activity monitoring, Web traffic measurements, Web caching, multimedia over Web, wireless Web, Web security, Web mining, and Web components. The course stresses the role of the most recent technologies, protocols, and standards and their applications in the industry. Students will have an opportunity to work with various Web tools, evaluate architectural configuratins, and investigate special areas of interest to them. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "WEB TECH/ARCH&INTGRATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29724/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.52", "rDifficulty": "1.87", "rTAQuality": "2.87", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.48", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.87", "rReadingsValue": "2.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "2.61", "rInstructorQuality": "2.62"}, "section": {"name": "WEB TECH/ARCH&INTGRATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "TCOM-514-001", "path": "/courses/29724/sections/001", "id": "29724-001", "aliases": ["TCOM-514-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/29724/sections/001/reviews/1179-AMJAD-UMAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1179-AMJAD-UMAR", "first_name": "AMJAD", "last_name": "UMAR", "id": "1179-AMJAD-UMAR", "name": "AMJAD UMAR"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "29724-001-1179-AMJAD-UMAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "TCOM-514", "path": "/courses/29724", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29724/sections", "values": [{"name": "WEB TECH/ARCH&INTGRATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "TCOM-514-001", "path": "/courses/29724/sections/001", "id": "29724-001", "aliases": ["TCOM-514-001"]}]}, "id": 29724, "aliases": ["TCOM-514"]}
