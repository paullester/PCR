{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5056"}, "description": "This lab course offers students the opportunity to apply skills learned in other TCOM classes, and experience in realistic settings the various netowrking concepts they have been exposed to. Students will be tasked with designing, configuring, and trouble-shooting IP based networks using a network testbed. Projects will expose students to networking technologies and solutions including Ethernet LANs, basic IPv4 routed network, inter-domain routing using BGP, as well as time permitting Ipv6, MPLS, Multicast, etc. In additional to successfully configuring and deploying various types of networks, students will be asked to change configuration parameters and observe and analyze the corresponding effects on network protocols and operation. Students will also be asked to examine packet traces from real networks, and use the information they extract from those traces to identify or explain the operational characteristics of the associated networks. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28210/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "3.18", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.45", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "3.64", "rInstructorAccess": "2.73", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.09", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "2.91"}, "section": {"name": "TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAB", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "TCOM-504-101", "path": "/courses/28210/sections/101", "id": "28210-101", "aliases": ["TCOM-504-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/28210/sections/101/reviews/5547-SHUMON-I--HUQUE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5547-SHUMON-I--HUQUE", "first_name": "SHUMON I.", "last_name": "HUQUE", "id": "5547-SHUMON-I--HUQUE", "name": "SHUMON I.
