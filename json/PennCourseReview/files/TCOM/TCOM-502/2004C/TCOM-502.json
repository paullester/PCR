{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2161"}, "description": "The course delves into the details of the many protocols whose combined operation is behind the Internet. It starts with reviewing issues associated with naming and addressing, and in particular solutions that work at the Internet scale. This is followed by an in-depth review of the Internet's \"control plane,\" namely the different routing protocols that govern packet forwarding decisions, including unicast (RIP2, EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, etc.) and multicast (DVMRP, CBT, PIM, etc.) routing protocols. The challenges associated with implementing efficient packet forwarding decisions are then discussed and illustrated through several representative techniques and algorithms. Next, the course introduces technologies that implement advanced functionality over IP networks, including signaling protocols, e.g., RSVP, used to request resources from the network, and protocols such as MPLS and MP-BGP that enable the efficient deployment of virtual private networks and traffic engineering solutions. If time permits, topics related to service classes and traffic management may also be covered. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "ADV NETWRKING PROTOC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5977/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.22", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "ADV NETWRKING PROTOC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "TCOM-502-001", "path": "/courses/5977/sections/001", "id": "5977-001", "aliases": ["TCOM-502-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/5977/sections/001/reviews/2370-ROCH-GUERIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2370-ROCH-GUERIN", "first_name": "ROCH", "last_name": "GUERIN", "id": "2370-ROCH-GUERIN", "name": "ROCH GUERIN"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "5977-001-2370-ROCH-GUERIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "TCOM-502", "path": "/courses/5977", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5977/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV NETWRKING PROTOC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "TCOM-502-001", "path": "/courses/5977/sections/001", "id": "5977-001", "aliases": ["TCOM-502-001"]}]}, "id": 5977, "aliases": ["TCOM-502"]}
