{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3835"}, "description": "A fast-paced introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming and software design. This course assumes some previous programming experience, at the level of a high school computer science class or CIS110. (If you got at least 4 in the AP Computer Science A or AB exam, you will do great.) No specific programming language background is assumed: basic experience with any language (for instance Java, C, C++, VB, Python, Perl, or Scheme) is fine. If you have never programmed before, you should take CIS 110 first. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PROG LANG & TECH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22819/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.38", "rWorkRequired": "3.41", "rInstructorAccess": "2.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.59", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.55"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG & TECH I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-120-001", "path": "/courses/22819/sections/001", "id": "22819-001", "aliases": ["CIS-120-001"]}, "comments": "CIS 120 introduced \u201cthe fundamental concepts of programming and software design\u201d using java and python. The course has been described by students as \u201ca good refresher course\u201d that teaches both \u201ctheory and practice\u201d and also introduces GUIs, more complicated data structures and Pythonic programming, but \u201cdoesn't teach many high-level aspects of programming.\u201d The course has been restructured, and the new curriculum focuses on OCaml and Java, with more emphasis on design.\r\n\r\nThere were varied opinions about this course. A number of people felt that it was a good class.  Several reported learning a lot of \u201cdirectly useful\u201d material enjoying the course overall. While some students thought that the course had an \u201cexcellent structure,\u201d the majority felt that that it needed drastic restructuring. Some students felt that the material was \u201crelevant and interesting\u201d and that it \u201cdid a good job of explaining concepts.\u201d  However, others found it to be \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and they reported having to rely on their high school programming experience to get through it. On that note, those without previous programming experience struggled a great deal in this course. Students who had previously taken CIS 110 wished that \u201cthere had been a transition course.\u201d However, those who took AP Computer Science AB felt that they should have been allowed to place out of this course.\r\n\r\nThere were also conflicting opinions about the lectures. While some students thought that they were \u201cfairly interesting,\u201d others felt that they were \u201cdull\u201d and \u201chard to digest.\u201d Material covered in lectures \u201crarely corresponded to material on exams and in projects.\u201d The labs were \u201cno more useful\u201d because there was no incentive to do anything in lab since the students \u201crarely coded\u201d and lab assignments weren\u2019t collected. One student reported that the homework assignments were \u201cmore useful than the lectures in terms of teaching the material.\u201d Another stated that they \u201cstarted off with \u2018training wheels\u2019 and become more open-ended as the course progressed.\u201d Many students regarded the lectures as extremely \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201ctime consuming.\u201d Most agreed that they were \u201cdisconnected\u201d from the assignments and that the syntax needed to complete them was not taught before they were due. The biggest and almost unanimous complaint was that homework constituted only 20% of the grade but comprised 80% of the work for the course. Students reported that the exams required them to hand write code, which many found \u201cunintuitive and counterproductive.\u201d As a result, there was \u201ca disconnect between what students can do (showed by their homework) and what they get on a timed test.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Marcus was described as \u201cdecent,\u201d \u201centertaining,\u201d and \u201ca leader in his field.\u201d While some students thought that he was approachable, they also felt that he was rarely helpful. Also, while some students reported that the professor explained the concepts and the material well, others felt that he went off on \u201crandom tangents\u201d and \u201clost his train of thought\u201d very frequently during lecture.  Others noted that Professor Marcus didn\u2019t appear to be familiar with his own slides. \r\n\r\nOverall, the course received average ratings from students. While it is required for CIS majors, it was not recommended to those who need not take it. However, some students recommended it to math and physics majors, and others recommended it to \u201cpeople who enjoy critical thinking.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 82, "path": "/courses/22819/sections/001/reviews/1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS", "first_name": "MITCHELL PHILIP", "last_name": "MARCUS", "id": "1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS", "name": "MITCHELL PHILIP MARCUS"}, "num_reviewers": 77, "id": "22819-001-1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.53", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.87", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.27", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.35"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG & TECH I", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "CIS-120-002", "path": "/courses/22819/sections/002", "id": "22819-002", "aliases": ["CIS-120-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22819/sections/002/reviews/1321-BENJAMIN-C--PIERCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1321-BENJAMIN-C--PIERCE", "first_name": "BENJAMIN C.", "last_name": "PIERCE", "id": "1321-BENJAMIN-C--PIERCE", "name": "BENJAMIN C.
