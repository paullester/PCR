This course assumes some previous (non-language specific) programming experience, at the level of a high school computer science class or CIS110 (for instance Java, C, C++, VB, Python, Perl, or Scheme). Students who have never programmed before should take CIS 110 first.\r\n\r\nMost students felt that the overall quality of this course was very high, although some had suggestions for the organization. While some felt that it was \u201cwell-structured,\u201d others had problems with the emphasis on the homeworks. Many felt that this aspect of the course \u201cwas very well-organized.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause of the emphasis placed on the homework, not many students addressed the quality of Professor Weirich\u2019s teaching. One student noted that Professor Weirich\u2019s \u201cmain functionality was preparing a basic structure for the course and answering questions.\u201d The same student also noticed that the TA\u2019s taught a lot of the material and that \u201cI\u2019m 10x the programmer now than I was when I started.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students noted that this course was difficult. One student described it as \u201cridiculously difficult for people without significant CS backgrounds.\u201d Another student noted that the \u201cwork to value ratio [is] too high,\u201d but another pointed out that it was \u201cpractical information\u201d learned.\r\n", "num_students": 145, "path": "/courses/27149/sections/001/reviews/1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "first_name": "STEPHANIE", "last_name": "WEIRICH", "id": "1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "name": "STEPHANIE WEIRICH"}, "num_reviewers": 123, "id": "27149-001-1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH"}]
