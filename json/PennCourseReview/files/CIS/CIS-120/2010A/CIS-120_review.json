Topics includes top-down program design, testing and debugging, interactive programming, iteration, recursion, data structures, and inheritance.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the class was a good combination of \u201ctheory and practice,\u201d with a few explicitly commenting that the use of java made the content feel more applicable. However, students were polarized towards the disconnect between lectures and the homework \u2013 some enjoyed spending time outside class learning more applied material for their homework, while others disliked bridging the gap outside of class.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marcus was described as \u201cvery entertaining\u201d but also difficult to follow in class occasionally. Some students found lectures \u201chard to digest\u201d because Professor Marcus sometimes had trouble remembering the correspondence between items on his lectures slides and the topics of discussion.\r\n\r\nHomework was often described as a \u201cdisproportionately high percentage of work\u201d that did not receive enough weight in the final grade. On the other hand, exams counted for a large portion of the final grade, yet students felt that being tested on writing code with paper and pencil did not capture well their understanding of the material. The course recommends that students have at least a high-school level background in computer programming, but does not require familiarity with java or python specifically.
