Java is the language of choice although some experimentation is done in Python. No textbook is required but the Java Backpack Reference Guide is highly recommended and allowed during exams.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course fast-paced and reported learning a lot.\r\n\r\nMost students liked Professor Marcus\\'s lectures and enthusiasm, calling him \u201ctotally fun\u201d.\r\n\r\nStudents found that homework assignments were excessive in length and did not really correspond to the material taught. The target audience is for students with some programming experience, especially in Java as it helps deal with minor tricks that aren\\'t taught.", "num_students": 77, "path": "/courses/15498/sections/001/reviews/1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS", "first_name": "MITCHELL PHILIP", "last_name": "MARCUS", "id": "1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS", "name": "MITCHELL PHILIP MARCUS"}, "num_reviewers": 75, "id": "15498-001-1345-MITCHELL-PHILIP-MARCUS"}]
