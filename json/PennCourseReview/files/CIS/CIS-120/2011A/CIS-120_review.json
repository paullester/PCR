Several students were uninterested in learning OCaml or found it difficult to learn \u201cwithout being taught explicitly about the syntax.\u201d Some more experienced students, however, thought it was a good choice to \u201clevel out the playing field\u201d in the intro class and give them new material to expand their programming knowledge. &#8232;&#8232;Students generally considered Professor Weirich a \u201cnice lady\u201d but a \u201cboring\u201d lecturer. A student noted that she was willing to meet but often directed him to the TAs who \u201creally run her class.\u201d  Many students complained about the excessively time-consuming homework assignments, especially considering how little they were worth towards the grade compared to the exams. Students stated that this course assumes some previous programming experience, at the level of a high school computer science class or CIS110. Some commented that those who received at least 4 in the AP Computer Science A or AB exam would be adequately prepared to take the class. No specific programming language background is assumed: basic experience with any language (for instance Java, C, C++, VB, Python, Perl, or Scheme) is fine. It is recommended that those who have never programmed before take CIS 110 before taking this course.", "num_students": 141, "path": "/courses/21444/sections/001/reviews/1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "first_name": "STEPHANIE", "last_name": "WEIRICH", "id": "1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "name": "STEPHANIE WEIRICH"}, "num_reviewers": 130, "id": "21444-001-1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH"}]
