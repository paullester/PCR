{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3835"}, "description": "A fast-paced introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming and software design. This course assumes some previous programming experience, at the level of a high school computer science class or CIS110. (If you got at least 4 in the AP Computer Science A or AB exam, you will do great.) No specific programming language background is assumed: basic experience with any language (for instance Java, C, C++, VB, Python, Perl, or Scheme) is fine. If you have never programmed before, you should take CIS 110 first. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "PROG LANG & TECH I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13020/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "2.59", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "2.87", "rReadingsValue": "1.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.92", "rCommAbility": "2.63", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG & TECH I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-120-001", "path": "/courses/13020/sections/001", "id": "13020-001", "aliases": ["CIS-120-001"]}, "comments": "Students in CIS 120 generally found that the material covered in lecture was not strongly correlated to the content and difficulty of the homework assignments.
