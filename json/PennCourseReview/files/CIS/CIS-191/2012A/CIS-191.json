Students had high remarks for the course, one stating that \u201cskills I learned were very spread out over different topics and pretty practical and useful.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough this class is stated to be taught by Boon Thau Loo, it was actually taught by the TA\u2019s Seth Shannin and Kevin Xu who received high remarks like \u201cSupport from the teaching staff has been great\u201d and \u201cSeth and Kevin were shining stars as instructors.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis class is intended for sophomores in the computer science department. However, any student trying to learn Unix and Linux programming languages.
