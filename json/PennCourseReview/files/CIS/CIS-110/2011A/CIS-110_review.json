CIS 110 is a \"Java lite\" course that covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming such as objects, classes, state, methods, loops, arrays, inheritance, and recursion using the Java programming language.&#8232;&#8232;The course begins with students learning Scratch as an introduction to programming. Each lecture is paired with a discussion group of about 15 students that meets once a week during the second weekly class time. Overall, students had negative reactions toward discussion groups, stating, that \u201cTAs are often too young to explain the material well\u201d and that \u201cdiscussion group leaders lacked enthusiasm.\u201d In addition, students were required to attend a two-hour lab once a week. Students generally felt that labs had the potential to be useful, but were \u201coften spent staring at the screen with no idea how to approach the problem.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;Several students felt that Professor Griffin tried to convey the material in an exciting and interesting way, but that she fell short when it came to effectively and engagingly teaching the class. Some agreed that she appeared \u201cdistant\u201d and \u201cout of touch,\u201d but noted that her interest in computer science was \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201ctranslatable.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;Although an introductory Java course, many students who take it already have Java experience, resulting in a difficult class curve that favors those who should be in a higher-level course. A popular comment among students was that \u201chomework was a good reinforcement of skills and concepts but lectures had zero value for learning the concepts.\u201d", "num_students": 163, "path": "/courses/21443/sections/001/reviews/1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN", "first_name": "JEAN", "last_name": "GRIFFIN", "id": "1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN", "name": "JEAN GRIFFIN"}, "num_reviewers": 149, "id": "21443-001-1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN"}]
