The second half of the course consists of case studies in applications of Haskell. Potential case study topics include automated randomized testing, concurrency, parallelism, software transactional memory, and embedded real-time systems. \r\n\r\nOverall, students thoroughly enjoyed this class. They found it to be \u201ca ton of fun intellectually\u201d and \u201ca much-appreciated departure\u201d from other CIS classes. As one student put it, this was a \u201cmind-expanding, well planned course.\u201d Students credit Professor Yorgey for their enjoyment of the class. They called him \u201cencouraging,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201ca big asset,\u201d and \u201ca fantastic teacher.\u201d According to many students, he was highly willing to help students and was easily accessible. \r\n\r\nThough this is not a required course, many students wished that it was and would highly encourage CIS majors to take it. \r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 5 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/22824/sections/001/reviews/5600-BRENT-A--YORGEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5600-BRENT-A--YORGEY", "first_name": "BRENT A.", "last_name": "YORGEY", "id": "5600-BRENT-A--YORGEY", "name": "BRENT A.
