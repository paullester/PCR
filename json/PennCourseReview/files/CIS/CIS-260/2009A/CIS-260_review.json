Topics include propositional logic, inference, sets, functions and relations, sequences and summations, induction principles, recursion, combinatorics and graph theory, and practice in writing and reading mathematical proofs.\r\n\r\nMany students felt the class provided a \u201cvaluable\u201d mathematical background for future computer classes, though some considered the amount of new content to be insubstantial.\r\n\r\nSome students praised Professor Nenkova as \u201caccommodating\u201d and \u201cthorough,\u201d but many others criticized her communication skills and felt she was unable or unwilling to listen to student input.\r\n\r\nStudents with a mathematical background often found this class to be \u201ceasy,\u201d repetitive, and slow. Students without a mathematical background found it to be significantly more challenging, but were more likely to value the course content.", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/15501/sections/001/reviews/4282-ANI-NENKOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4282-ANI-NENKOVA", "first_name": "ANI", "last_name": "NENKOVA", "id": "4282-ANI-NENKOVA", "name": "ANI NENKOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 56, "id": "15501-001-4282-ANI-NENKOVA"}]
