Students noticed an overlap with this course\u2019s material and CIS502. However one student stated how \u201cI would have liked a more mathematical course, but the current format is definitely most appropriate for the intended audience.\u201d Students also enjoyed the textbook which is \u201camazing, very detailed, and covered everything that was in the class.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents commended Prof. Kannan\u2019s teaching style, which made the material accessible to students. Students also called the professor \u201cexciting.\u201d Students stated that most TA\u2019s were incredibly helpful and highly recommended seeing them outside of class for homework assistance.\r\n\r\nThis course is intended for upper level undergraduate or graduate computer science students. Homework was reported as time-consuming and challenging especially at the beginning, but students were comforted by the fact that homework didn\u2019t count much towards grading and really helped with understanding the class material. \r\n", "num_students": 66, "path": "/courses/27168/sections/001/reviews/247-SAMPATH-K--KANNAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/247-SAMPATH-K--KANNAN", "first_name": "SAMPATH K.", "last_name": "KANNAN", "id": "247-SAMPATH-K--KANNAN", "name": "SAMPATH K.
