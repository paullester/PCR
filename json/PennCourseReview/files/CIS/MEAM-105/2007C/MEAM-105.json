{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3447"}, "description": "This course will provide an introduction to computation and data analysis using MATLAB - an industry standard programming and visualization environment. The course will cover the fundamentals of computing including: variables, functions, flow control, iteration and recursion. These concepts will be illustrated through examples and assignments which show how computing is applied to various scientific and engineering problems. Examples will be drawn from the simulation of physical and chemical systems, the analysis of experimental data, Monte Carlo numerical experiments, image and audio processing, and control of sensors and actuators. This course does not assume any prior programming experience but will make use of basic concepts from calculus and Newtonian physics. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTRO SCIENTIFIC COMP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13537/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "3.21", "rStimulateInterest": "1.71", "rRecommendMajor": "2.46", "rCourseQuality": "1.88", "rWorkRequired": "3.42", "rInstructorAccess": "2.13", "rReadingsValue": "1.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.83", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.08"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO SCIENTIFIC COMP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-105-401", "path": "/courses/13537/sections/401", "id": "13537-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-105-401", "CIS-105-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/13537/sections/401/reviews/309-CAMILLO-JOSE-TAYLOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/309-CAMILLO-JOSE-TAYLOR", "first_name": "CAMILLO JOSE", "last_name": "TAYLOR", "id": "309-CAMILLO-JOSE-TAYLOR", "name": "CAMILLO JOSE TAYLOR"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "13537-401-309-CAMILLO-JOSE-TAYLOR"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.74", "rDifficulty": "3.44", "rStimulateInterest": "1.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.48", "rCourseQuality": "1.85", "rWorkRequired": "3.48", "rInstructorAccess": "2.42", "rReadingsValue": "1.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "1.62", "rInstructorQuality": "1.93"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO SCIENTIFIC COMP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-105-401", "path": "/courses/13537/sections/401", "id": "13537-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-105-401", "CIS-105-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/13537/sections/401/reviews/2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "first_name": "GEORGE", "last_name": "BIROS", "id": "2549-GEORGE-BIROS", "name": "GEORGE BIROS"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "13537-401-2549-GEORGE-BIROS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-105", "path": "/courses/13537", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13537/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO SCIENTIFIC COMP", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-105-401", "path": "/courses/13537/sections/401", "id": "13537-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-105-401", "CIS-105-401"]}]}, "id": 13537, "aliases": ["MEAM-105", "CIS-105"]}
