Topics covered are: (1) basic digital system design including finite state machines, (2) instruction set design and simple RISC assembly programming, (3) quantitative evaluation of computer performance, (4) circuits for integer and floating-point arithmetic, (5) data path and control, (6) micro-programming, (7) pipelining, (8) storage hierarchy and virtual memory, (9) input/output, (10) different forms of parallelism including instruction level parallelism, data-level parallelism using both vectors and message-passing multi-processors, and thread-level parallelism using shared memory multiprocessors and basic cache coherence and synchronization.&#8232;&#8232;All student comments are unanimous in that the class was challenging but very interesting.
