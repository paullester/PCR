Topics covered are: (1) basic digital system design including finite state machines, (2) instruction set design and simple RISC assembly programming, (3) quantitative evaluation of computer performance, (4) circuits for integer and floating-point arithmatic, (5) datapath and control, (6) micro-programming, (7) pipeling, (8) storage hierarchy and virtual memory, (9) input/output, (10) different forms of parallelism including instruction level parallelism, data-level parallelism using both vectors and message-passing multi-processors, and thread-level parallelism using shared memory multiprocessors. Basic cache coherence and synchronization. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "COMP ORG AND DESIGN LAB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15505/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.03", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.42", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "COMP ORG AND DESIGN LAB", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-371-001", "path": "/courses/15505/sections/001", "id": "15505-001", "aliases": ["CIS-371-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/15505/sections/001/reviews/2434-MILO-M--K--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2434-MILO-M--K--MARTIN", "first_name": "MILO M.
