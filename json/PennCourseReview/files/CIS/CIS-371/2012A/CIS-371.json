Students reported learning a great deal and came out of this course \u201cwith a better understanding of what a computer is, how it is made, and how it actually works.\u201d Many found the lecture part of this course \u201ctruly intriguing,\u201d and the whole course \u201ca good extension of CIS 240.\u201d Some claimed that they did not have time to review any material covered in lecture due to the sheer amount of work required. Most would like more preparation before labs. Overall, the course helped to enhance students\u2019 \u201ccritical thinking and code debugging skills.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe majority of students liked Professor Martin, especially his lectures. Some indicated that he \u201cwould listen to student feedback and adjust material if necessary in order to make it more fair for everyone.\u201d However, some did not agree with the weight of the labs towards the final grade.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisite for this course is CIS 240. Though the course only counts for 1 credit instead of 1.5 credits, the workload has not diminished. The workload was also noted to be heavily end-loaded.\r\n", "num_students": 59, "path": "/courses/27160/sections/001/reviews/2434-MILO-M--K--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2434-MILO-M--K--MARTIN", "first_name": "MILO M.
