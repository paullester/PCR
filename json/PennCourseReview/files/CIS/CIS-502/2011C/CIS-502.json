The\r\ncourse material also covers efficiency and complexity of algorithms, as well as\r\ncomplexity classes.\r\nMost of the students that took this course found it to be an overall great and \u201cvery\r\nuseful\u201d course. Many students also found the textbook for the course to be excellent and\r\nfelt that it was a great complement to the lectures.\r\nStudents for the most part were satisfied with Professor Guha. However, they did\r\nexpress that Professor Guha could have explained the difficult concepts more clearly and\r\nin a way that would be easier to understand.\r\nThis is a \u201cdifficult\u201d course that requires a lot of devotion to understanding the\r\nmaterial. There are also a lot of homework assignments that take a lot of time. Students\r\nrecommended this course to any graduate student with interest in algorithms, but\r\ncautioned that students shouldn\u2019t take too many difficult courses at the same time. The\r\nprerequisite for this class is CIT 594 or an equivalent course.", "num_students": 124, "path": "/courses/24179/sections/001/reviews/298-SUDIPTO-GUHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/298-SUDIPTO-GUHA", "first_name": "SUDIPTO", "last_name": "GUHA", "id": "298-SUDIPTO-GUHA", "name": "SUDIPTO GUHA"}, "num_reviewers": 112, "id": "24179-001-298-SUDIPTO-GUHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-502", "path": "/courses/24179", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24179/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-502-001", "path": "/courses/24179/sections/001", "id": "24179-001", "aliases": ["CIS-502-001"]}]}, "id": 24179, "aliases": ["CIS-502"]}
