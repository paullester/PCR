{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3847"}, "description": "The goal of the senior design coruse is to provide students with an opportunity to define, design and execute a significant project. Project subjects may revolve around software, hardware or computational theory. Students must have an abstract of their Senior Project, which is approved and signed by a Project Advisor early in the Fall semester. The project is expected to span two semesters; students must enroll in CIS 401 during the second semester. At the end of the first semester, students are required to submit an intermediate report and give a presentation describing their project and progress. Grades are based on technical writing skills (as per submited report) presentation skills and progress on the project. These are evaluated by the Project Adviser and the Course Instructor. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "SENIOR PROJECT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24173/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.52", "rStimulateInterest": "1.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.48", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.53", "rReadingsValue": "1.72", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.10", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.37"}, "section": {"name": "SENIOR PROJECT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-400-001", "path": "/courses/24173/sections/001", "id": "24173-001", "aliases": ["CIS-400-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/24173/sections/001/reviews/1821-INSUP-LEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1821-INSUP-LEE", "first_name": "INSUP", "last_name": "LEE", "id": "1821-INSUP-LEE", "name": "INSUP LEE"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "24173-001-1821-INSUP-LEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-400", "path": "/courses/24173", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24173/sections", "values": [{"name": "SENIOR PROJECT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-400-001", "path": "/courses/24173/sections/001", "id": "24173-001", "aliases": ["CIS-400-001"]}]}, "id": 24173, "aliases": ["CIS-400"]}
