{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4912"}, "description": "C# is the premier programming language for the .NET framework. Over the last decade, the language has evolved to meet the needs of a variety of programming styles while supporting the ever-growing capabilities of the the .NET runtime and libraries. This course provides a thorough introduction to the C# language and the .NET framework, building on the skills gained in the introductory programming courses (CIS 110, CIS 120, or ESE 112). In addition to providing the student with a solid background in C#, this course also explores topics that the .NET platform exposes such as object oriented design, .NET runtime internals, and others based on class interest. A series of short, weekly homework assignments reinforces the concepts introduced in class and a group-based final project of the students' design allows them to apply their C# knowledge toward a substantial problem. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "C# PROG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25799/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "2.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.46", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.54", "rCommAbility": "3.15", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "C# PROG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-193-001", "path": "/courses/25799/sections/001", "id": "25799-001", "aliases": ["CIS-193-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/25799/sections/001/reviews/5317-PETER-MICHAEL-S--OSERA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5317-PETER-MICHAEL-S--OSERA", "first_name": "PETER-MICHAEL S.", "last_name": "OSERA", "id": "5317-PETER-MICHAEL-S--OSERA", "name": "PETER-MICHAEL S.
