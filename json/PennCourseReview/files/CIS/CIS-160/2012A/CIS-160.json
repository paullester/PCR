Students considered it as \u201ca good introduction to the mathematical basis of computer science.\u201d Students had access to a very limited amount of material in preparing for the examinations, but found the class notes and review sessions to be particularly helpful. Some thought that not all topics covered were relevant and enlightening.\r\n\r\nThe majority of students liked Professor Mintz but some noted that he was seldom available outside of class. Students reported that the course TAs were extremely helpful in helping students get caught up in the material, but hoped that \u201cthey could have been more attentive to online posts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe course is a requirement for CIS majors and minors.\r\n", "num_students": 111, "path": "/courses/27151/sections/001/reviews/304-MAX-MINTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/304-MAX-MINTZ", "first_name": "MAX", "last_name": "MINTZ", "id": "304-MAX-MINTZ", "name": "MAX MINTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 96, "id": "27151-001-304-MAX-MINTZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-160", "path": "/courses/27151", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27151/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATH FOUND COMP SCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-160-001", "path": "/courses/27151/sections/001", "id": "27151-001", "aliases": ["CIS-160-001"]}]}, "id": 27151, "aliases": ["CIS-160"]}
