Many students were, however, dissatisfied with the grading system.\r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 opinions about Professor Gallier were mixed.  Students generally appreciated his amazing sense of humor and his constant jokes and anecdotes, which they felt made the class enjoyable. However, many thought that he moved through the material too quickly, did not lecture in a clear way, and did not provide sufficient examples to tackle the homework problems.  Some reported that since he used his own notation and tree approach for proofs, it was impossible to find other sources that may have been of help.\r\n\r\nOverall, the course received poor ratings from students. While it was recommended to all CIS majors, it was not recommended to those who need not take it.\r\n", "num_students": 84, "path": "/courses/22822/sections/001/reviews/248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "first_name": "JEAN HENRI", "last_name": "GALLIER", "id": "248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "name": "JEAN HENRI GALLIER"}, "num_reviewers": 72, "id": "22822-001-248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-160", "path": "/courses/22822", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22822/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATH FOUND COMP SCI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-160-001", "path": "/courses/22822/sections/001", "id": "22822-001", "aliases": ["CIS-160-001"]}]}, "id": 22822, "aliases": ["CIS-160"]}
