It seeks to answer questions about social networks, Google and decision making in an integrated manor. Although material includes computer science topics, it is geared towards a general audience. Readings include texts such as Malcolm Gladwell\\'s The Tipping Point and Thomas Schelling\\'s Micromotives and Macrobehavior as well as various recent articles.\r\n\r\nOverall, students found the course \u201cintellectually stimulating\u201d and appreciated the understandable explanations given for technical terms.\r\n\r\nMost students found Professor Kearns\\'s lectures \u201ca blast\u201d although some commented about how the same information was available on slides. Very few mentioned needing to attend office hours.\r\n\r\nThe course covers a large variety of interests since it fulfills a Quantitative Data Analysis requirement. As a result, it caters more toward students who have little experience in the topics. Students well-versed in these topics commented that the course went too slowly and didn\\'t go into depth.", "num_students": 146, "path": "/courses/15497/sections/001/reviews/1356-MICHAEL-J--KEARNS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1356-MICHAEL-J--KEARNS", "first_name": "MICHAEL J.", "last_name": "KEARNS", "id": "1356-MICHAEL-J--KEARNS", "name": "MICHAEL J.
