Can you verify that a program has correctly computed a function without ever computing the function? Can students compute the average score on an exam without ever revealing their scores to each other? Can you be convinced of the correctness of an assertion without ever seeing the proof? The answer to all these questions is in the affirmative provided we allow the use of randomization. Over the past few decades, randomization has emerged as a powerful resource in algorithm desgin. This course would focus on powerful general techniques for designing randomized algorithms as well as specific representative applications in various domains, including approximation algorithms, cryptography and number theory, data structure design, online algorithms, and parallel and distributed computation. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ADV TPCS IN ALGORITHMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24171/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "3.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.09", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.89", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.91", "rCommAbility": "3.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.92"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-334-001", "path": "/courses/24171/sections/001", "id": "24171-001", "aliases": ["CIS-334-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/24171/sections/001/reviews/305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "first_name": "SANJEEV", "last_name": "KHANNA", "id": "305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "name": "SANJEEV KHANNA"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "24171-001-305-SANJEEV-KHANNA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-334", "path": "/courses/24171", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24171/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV TPCS IN ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-334-001", "path": "/courses/24171/sections/001", "id": "24171-001", "aliases": ["CIS-334-001"]}]}, "id": 24171, "aliases": ["CIS-334"]}
