Can you verify that a program has correctly computed a function without ever computing the function? Can students compute the average score on an exam without ever revealing their scores to each other? Can you be convinced of the correctness of an assertion without ever seeing the proof? The answer to all these questions is in the affirmative provided we allow the use of randomization. Over the past few decades, randomization has emerged as a powerful resource in algorithm desgin. This course would focus on powerful general techniques for designing randomized algorithms as well as specific representative applications in various domains, including approximation algorithms, cryptography and number theory, data structure design, online algorithms, and parallel and distributed computation. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ADV TPCS IN ALGORITHMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22828/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "3.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADV TPCS IN ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-334-001", "path": "/courses/22828/sections/001", "id": "22828-001", "aliases": ["CIS-334-001"]}, "comments": "This course focuses on powerful general techniques for designing randomized algorithms as well as specific representative applications in various domains, including approximation algorithms, cryptography and number theory, data structure design, online algorithms, and parallel and distributed computation.\r\n\r\nStudents generally heaped praise on the course. One called it the \u201cmost amazing and intense learning experiences.\u201d Most students enjoyed the course greatly. While many felt that the concepts were complicated, they thought that Professor Khanna was able to explain them in great clarity.\r\n\r\nOverall, students regarded Professor Khanna as \u201cexcellent\u201d and felt that his excitement was contagious.\r\n\r\nMost students felt that assignments were challenging and demanding, but not excessive.
