The course devotes special attention\r\nto the use of simple computational and mathematical models. Topics include perception,\r\nlearning, memory, decision making, emotion and consciousness.\r\nStudents reported that this course was \u201cscattered\u201d and \u201crandom,\u201d but still\r\n\u201cinteresting.\u201d Students did note that the nature of the field is broad, and that the\r\nintroductory course just sweeps the surface of the field\u2019s foci. Students felt that the\r\ncontent was \u201ctoo broad,\u201d so they were unable to \u201clearn anything valuable.\u201d Depending\r\non the student\u2019s interest in the field of cognitive science, some students deemed this\r\ncourse the \u201cbest course\u201d at Penn or the \u201cworst course\u201d at Penn.\r\nOverall, students were pleased with Professor Brainard. He offered many office\r\nhours and was \u201cextremely accessible.\u201d In addition, students found office hours very\r\nhelpful. Students noted that they enjoyed Professor Brainard\u2019s lectures. Although\r\nstudents found the course scattered, they recognized that Professor Brainard attempted to\r\nmake connections.\r\nStudent\u2019s found the course relatively difficult, but they noted that recitations,\r\noffice hours, and lectures were very helpful. Students found that the course emphasized\r\nstatistics and scientific analysis more than they had anticipated, which made the work\r\nmore complex and difficult. Overall, there was a \u201cfair amount\u201d of work associated with\r\nthe course. This counts as a Formal Reasoning course for College students.
