The intent of the course is to provide the student with a solid technical foundation for developing, animating and controlling articulated systems used in interactive computer game virtual reality simulations and high-end animation applications. The course balances theory with practice by \"looking under the hood\" of current animation systems and authoring tools and exams the technologies and techniques used from both a computer science and engineering perspective. Topics covered include: geometric coordinate systems and transformations; quaternions; parametric curves and surfaces; forward and inverse kinematics; dynamic systems and control; computer simulation; keyframe, motion capture and procedural animation; behavior-based animation and control; facial animation; smart characters and intelligent agents. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "COMPUTER ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24176/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "3.23", "rStimulateInterest": "2.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.77", "rCommAbility": "2.96", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23"}, "section": {"name": "COMPUTER ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-462-401", "path": "/courses/24176/sections/401", "id": "24176-401", "aliases": ["CIS-462-401", "CIS-562-401"]}, "comments": "This course covers core subject matter common to the fields of robotics, character\r\nanimation and embodied intelligent agents.
