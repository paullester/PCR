{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3848"}, "description": "This course covers core subject matter common to the fields of robotics, character animation and embodied intelligent agents. The intent of the course is to provide the student with a solid technical foundation for developing, animating and controlling articulated systems used in interactive computer game virtual reality simulations and high-end animation applications. The course balances theory with practice by \"looking under the hood\" of current animation systems and authoring tools and exams the technologies and techniques used from both a computer science and engineering perspective. Topics covered include: geometric coordinate systems and transformations; quaternions; parametric curves and surfaces; forward and inverse kinematics; dynamic systems and control; computer simulation; keyframe, motion capture and procedural animation; behavior-based animation and control; facial animation; smart characters and intelligent agents. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "COMPUTER ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28725/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.24", "rTAQuality": "3.12", "rStimulateInterest": "2.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "3.26", "rWorkRequired": "3.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.52", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "COMPUTER ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-462-401", "path": "/courses/28725/sections/401", "id": "28725-401", "aliases": ["CIS-462-401", "CIS-562-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/28725/sections/401/reviews/310-STEPHEN-LANE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/310-STEPHEN-LANE", "first_name": "STEPHEN", "last_name": "LANE", "id": "310-STEPHEN-LANE", "name": "STEPHEN LANE"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "28725-401-310-STEPHEN-LANE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-462", "path": "/courses/28725", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28725/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMPUTER ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-462-401", "path": "/courses/28725/sections/401", "id": "28725-401", "aliases": ["CIS-462-401", "CIS-562-401"]}]}, "id": 28725, "aliases": ["CIS-462", "CIS-562"]}
