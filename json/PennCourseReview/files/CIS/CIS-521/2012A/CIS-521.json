However, they were less enthusiastic about course organization; one student noted that the TAs released \u201cprogramming assignments the night before their due date, which is somewhat unheard of.\u201d The exams for the class were entirely multiple choice, which one student thought was highly unusual for a 500 level CIS class.\r\n\r\nOne student remarked that Dr. Ungar was \u201cgreat at communicating with us the ideas and principles of the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis a graduate course in CIS, and was recommended for majors. Although many students were unfamiliar with Python, the language was not thoroughly explained in lecture before the homework, which greatly increased the workload.\r\n", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/27170/sections/001/reviews/2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR", "first_name": "LYLE H", "last_name": "UNGAR", "id": "2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR", "name": "LYLE H UNGAR"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "27170-001-2085-LYLE-H-UNGAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-521", "path": "/courses/27170", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27170/sections", "values": [{"name": "FUNDAMENTALS OF AI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-521-001", "path": "/courses/27170/sections/001", "id": "27170-001", "aliases": ["CIS-521-001"]}]}, "id": 27170, "aliases": ["CIS-521"]}
