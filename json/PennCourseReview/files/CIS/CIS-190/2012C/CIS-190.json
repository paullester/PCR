{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5089"}, "description": "This course will provide an introduction to programming in C++ and is intended for students who already have some exposure to programming in another language such as Java, C++ provides the programmer with a greater level of control over machine resources and are commonly used in situations where low level access or performance are important. This course will illuminate the issues associated with programming at this level and will cover issues such as explicit memory management, pointers, the compilation process and debugging. The course will involve several programming projects which will provide students with the experience they need to program effectively in these languages. This course assumes programming experience equivalent to CIS 110, CIS 120 or ESE 112. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "C++ PROG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28711/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rTAQuality": "2.64", "rStimulateInterest": "2.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "C++ PROG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-190-001", "path": "/courses/28711/sections/001", "id": "28711-001", "aliases": ["CIS-190-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/28711/sections/001/reviews/6249-RICHARD-A-EISENBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6249-RICHARD-A-EISENBERG", "first_name": "RICHARD A", "last_name": "EISENBERG", "id": "6249-RICHARD-A-EISENBERG", "name": "RICHARD A EISENBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "28711-001-6249-RICHARD-A-EISENBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-190", "path": "/courses/28711", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28711/sections", "values": [{"name": "C++ PROG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-190-001", "path": "/courses/28711/sections/001", "id": "28711-001", "aliases": ["CIS-190-001"]}]}, "id": 28711, "aliases": ["CIS-190"]}
