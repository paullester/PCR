This course illuminates the issues associated with programming at this level\r\nand covers issues such as explicit memory management, pointers, the compilation\r\nprocess and debugging. The course involves several programming projects which provide\r\nstudents with the experience they need to program effectively in these languages. This\r\ncourse assumes programming experience equivalent to CIS 110, CIS 120 or ESE 112.\r\nStudents found this course to be an excellent introduction to C and C++ and\r\nreported \u201clearning more than [they had] expected.\u201d Many students wished that there was\r\nmore lecture time, due to the amount of material covered.\r\nStudents felt that the instructor planned out an excellent syllabus. Some\r\ncommented that the lecture and homework material did not match up, which made the\r\nassignments difficult for people with little C/C++ background.\r\nStudents mostly felt that there was too much work for a half credit class. They\r\nalso commented that homework should be graded more quickly.\r\nThis course review was written based on the 8 student comments received.", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/24166/sections/001/reviews/5727-ZACHARY-ZARROW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5727-ZACHARY-ZARROW", "first_name": "ZACHARY", "last_name": "ZARROW", "id": "5727-ZACHARY-ZARROW", "name": "ZACHARY ZARROW"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "24166-001-5727-ZACHARY-ZARROW"}]
