{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1743"}, "description": "This course introduces basic concepts and techniques in the foundational study of programming languages. The central theme is the view of individual programs and whole languages as mathematical objects about which precise claims may be made and proved. Particular topics include operational techniques for formal definition of language features, type systems and type safety properties, polymorphism and subtyping, foundations of object-oriented programming, and mechanisms supporting information hiding and programming in the large. This course is appropriate as an upper-level undergraduate CIS elective \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "SOFTWARE FOUNDATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8676/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "SOFTWARE FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-500-001", "path": "/courses/8676/sections/001", "id": "8676-001", "aliases": ["CIS-500-001"]}, "comments": "Students found the class to be extremely interesting and challenging.
