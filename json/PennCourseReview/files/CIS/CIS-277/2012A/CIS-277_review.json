Using 2D and 3D implementations, it covers fundamental topics on scene graphs, computational geometry, graphics algorithms, and user interface design. Programming languages introduced include C++, OpenGL, and Qt.\r\n\r\nOverall, students described the course as rewarding and helpful, but extremely difficult and even torturous at times. Many indicated that it was \u201cthe most time intensive course\u201d they have taken at Penn and that \u201cthe material taught during class is very disconnected to the homework.\u201d Although most students gained a newfound appreciation for computer graphics and programming by the end of the class, they spent an enormous amount of time teaching themselves them material and completing the homework.\r\n\r\nThe majority of students expressed gratitude to their TAs for their willingness to help, and found their office hours extremely valuable. Some commented that they would have barely passed this course \u201cif it weren\u2019t for the incredible team of TAs.\u201d Meanwhile, Professor Badler was regarded as \u201cnon-existent throughout this course.\u201d Students reported that he \u201crarely [showed] up in office hours,\u201d and did not organize the course well. Others noted that the homework files were \u201cvague\u201d and that the slides were not helpful.\r\n\r\nThe course is required for DMD majors, but is also recommended to CIS majors. The prerequisite is CIS 120. CIS 121 and CIS 240 are useful as pre- or co-requisites. Students wishing to take this course should be wary of the great time commitment.\r\n", "num_students": 62, "path": "/courses/27156/sections/001/reviews/1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "first_name": "NORMAN I", "last_name": "BADLER", "id": "1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "name": "NORMAN I BADLER"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "27156-001-1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "3.64", "rStimulateInterest": "1.58", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.32", "rWorkRequired": "3.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.08", "rReadingsValue": "1.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.81", "rCommAbility": "1.81", "rInstructorQuality": "1.72"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMP GRAPH TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-277-001", "path": "/courses/27156/sections/001", "id": "27156-001", "aliases": ["CIS-277-001"]}, "comments": "This course is focused on programming the essential geometric and mathematical concepts underlying modern computer graphics.
