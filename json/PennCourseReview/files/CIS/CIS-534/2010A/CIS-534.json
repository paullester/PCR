{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5309"}, "description": "This course is a pragmatic examination of multicore programming and the hardware architecture of modern multicore processors. Unlike the sequential single-core processors of the past, utilizing a multicore processor requires programmers to identify parallelism and write explicitly parallel code. Topics covered include: the relevant architectural trends and aspects of multicores, approaches for writing multicore software by extracting data parallelism (vectors and SIMD), thread-level parallelism, and task-based parallelism, efficient synchronization, and program profiling and performance tuning. The course focuses primarily on mainstream shared-memory multicores with some coverage of graphics processing units (GPUs). Cluster-based supercomputing is not a focus of this course. Several programming assignments and a course project will provide students first-hand experience with programming, experimentally analyzing, and tuning multicore software. Students are expected to have a solid understanding of computer architecture and strong programming skills (including experience with C/C++). \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "MULTICORE PROG & ARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25812/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.81", "rCourseQuality": "3.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "MULTICORE PROG & ARCH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-534-001", "path": "/courses/25812/sections/001", "id": "25812-001", "aliases": ["CIS-534-001"]}, "comments": "This course is a pragmatic examination of multicore programming and the hardware architecture of modern multicore processors.

One student thought it was \u201cthe best course I have had here till now\u201d. For a first time class, the students thought that the material was good and well selected.\r\n\r\nStudents thought Professor Martin was an amazing professor, although wished that he did not use as much of a slide lecture format.\r\n\r\nStudents complained about the amount of work, especially for a seminar class. Students wished that homework assignments were clearer and late clarifications were not necessary. Prerequisites for this course are CIS 371 or CIS 501 and significant programming experience ", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/25812/sections/001/reviews/2434-MILO-M--K--MARTIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2434-MILO-M--K--MARTIN", "first_name": "MILO M.
