Emphasis will be placed on both analytical and computational techniques. This course is designed to provide students with an exposure to the fundamental mathematical and algorithmic techniques that are used to tackle challenging image based modeling problems. The subject matter of this course finds application in the fields of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Robotics. Some of the topics to be covered include: Projective Geometry, Camera Calibration, Image Formation, Projective, Affine and Euclidean Transformations, Computational Stereopsis, and the recovery of 3D structure from multiple 2D images. This course will also explore various approaches to object recognition that make use of geometric techniques, these would include alignment based methods and techniques that exploit geometric invariants. In the assignments for this course, students will be able to apply the techniques to actual computer vision problems.\r\n\r\nStudents overall reported that the course was \u201cwonderful,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201cvery interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents felt the professor could \u201cimprove on his methods\u201d but \u201cloves teaching\u201d and has a \u201cgood interest.\u201d Most students also agreed that the TAs were \u201cunderstandable and hardworking.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough the class was \u201cdifficult,\u201d students felt the homework assignments were \u201cgreat applications.\u201d Students also found the 24-hour exams to be \u201cvery stressful.\u201d   This course is appropriate as an upper-level undergraduate CIS elective.\r\n", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/27179/sections/001/reviews/312-KONSTANTINOS-DANIILIDIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/312-KONSTANTINOS-DANIILIDIS", "first_name": "KONSTANTINOS", "last_name": "DANIILIDIS", "id": "312-KONSTANTINOS-DANIILIDIS", "name": "KONSTANTINOS DANIILIDIS"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "27179-001-312-KONSTANTINOS-DANIILIDIS"}]
