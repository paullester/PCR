{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4537"}, "description": "This is an introductory course to Computer Vision and Computational Photography. This course will explore three topics: 1) image morphing, 2) image matching and stitching, and 3) image recognition. This course is intended to provide a hands-on experience with interesting things to do on images/videos. The world is becoming image-centric. Cameras are now found everywhere, in our cell phones, automobiles, even in medical surgery tools. Computer vision technology has led to latest innovations in areas such as Hollywood movie production, medical diagnosis, biometrics, and digital library. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "COMP VISION&CMPTNL PHOTO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24190/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "2.66", "rStimulateInterest": "2.74", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.74", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.26", "rCommAbility": "2.54", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "COMP VISION&CMPTNL PHOTO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-581-001", "path": "/courses/24190/sections/001", "id": "24190-001", "aliases": ["CIS-581-001"]}, "comments": "This lab covers the following topics: robot actuators and sensors; link and\r\ncontroller models and computer simulations; position and force control principles;\r\nmultiple-link interactions; system definition, design, and integration; control policies; and\r\nfine-motion position and force control.\r\nStudents were pleased with this course.
