The course introduces the Minimum Description Length Paradigm to unite basic ideas about randomness, inference and computation. Students are expected to use the Maple programming environment in homework exercises which will include numerical and symbolic computations, simulations, and graphical displays.\r\n\r\nOne student described the course material as hard and stated that the small class size was necessary for the \u201cprofessor to have a close contact with students\u201d to explain it clearly. Another student felt that this was one of the few courses in which he had really learned something at Penn.\r\n\r\nAll three students lauded Professor Mintz for his engaging and inspiring instruction, emphasizing the fact that he \u201caims to educate.\u201d One student pointed out that \u201cmany people say that he is the person from the CIS department who influenced them most for their studies\u201d and that he shared this view.\r\n\r\nHomework assignments and quizzes followed the material covered in class. The prerequisite for this course is CIS 160.\r\n\r\nThis course review is based on the 3 student comments that were submitted.\r\n", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/22826/sections/001/reviews/304-MAX-MINTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/304-MAX-MINTZ", "first_name": "MAX", "last_name": "MINTZ", "id": "304-MAX-MINTZ", "name": "MAX MINTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "22826-001-304-MAX-MINTZ"}]
