{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3839"}, "description": "This course tightly integrates the theory and applications of discrete probability, discrete stochastic processes, and discrete statistical inference in the study of computer science. The course will introduce the Minimum Description Length Paradigm to unite basic ideas about randomness, inference and computation. Students will be expected to use the Maple programming environment in homework exercises which will include numerical and symbolic computations, simulations, and graphical displays. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "DISCRETE PROB & STAT INF", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18438/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "DISCRETE PROB & STAT INF", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-261-001", "path": "/courses/18438/sections/001", "id": "18438-001", "aliases": ["CIS-261-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/18438/sections/001/reviews/304-MAX-MINTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/304-MAX-MINTZ", "first_name": "MAX", "last_name": "MINTZ", "id": "304-MAX-MINTZ", "name": "MAX MINTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "18438-001-304-MAX-MINTZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-261", "path": "/courses/18438", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18438/sections", "values": [{"name": "DISCRETE PROB & STAT INF", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-261-001", "path": "/courses/18438/sections/001", "id": "18438-001", "aliases": ["CIS-261-001"]}]}, "id": 18438, "aliases": ["CIS-261"]}
