{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4709"}, "description": "This course is an automatic summarization that can help alleviate the information overload problem caused by the unprecedented amount of online textual information. The building of a summarization system requires good understanding of the properties of human language and the use of various natural language tools. In this course we will build several summarization systems of increasing complexity and sophistication. In the process we will learn about various natural language processing tools and resources such as part of speech tagging, chunking, parsing, Wordnet, and machine learning toolkits. We will also cover probability and statistics concepts used in summarization, but also applicable to a wide range of other language-related tasks. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRO TO HUMAN LANG TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28723/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rTAQuality": "1.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "2.25", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO HUMAN LANG TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-430-001", "path": "/courses/28723/sections/001", "id": "28723-001", "aliases": ["CIS-430-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/28723/sections/001/reviews/4282-ANI-NENKOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4282-ANI-NENKOVA", "first_name": "ANI", "last_name": "NENKOVA", "id": "4282-ANI-NENKOVA", "name": "ANI NENKOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "28723-001-4282-ANI-NENKOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-430", "path": "/courses/28723", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28723/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO HUMAN LANG TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-430-001", "path": "/courses/28723/sections/001", "id": "28723-001", "aliases": ["CIS-430-001"]}]}, "id": 28723, "aliases": ["CIS-430"]}
