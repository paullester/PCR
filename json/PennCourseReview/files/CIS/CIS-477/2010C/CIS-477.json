{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3849"}, "description": "Basic concepts of set theory, relations and functions, properties of relations. Basic concepts of algebra. Grammars, languages, and automata- finite state grammars, regular expressions, context-free and context-sensitive grammars, unrestricted grammars, finite automata, pushdown automata and other related automata, Turing machines, Syntax and semantics of grammar formalisms. Strong generative capacity of grammars, Grammers as deductive systems, parsing as deduction. Relevance of formal gammars to modeling biological sequences. The course will deal with these topics in a very basic and introductory manner--ideas of proofs and not detailed proofs, and more importantly with plenty of linguistic examples to bring out the linguistic relevance of these topics. \n\nThe course will deal with these topics in a very basic and introductory manner--ideas of proofs and not detailed proofs, and more importantly with plenty of linguistic examples to bring out the linguistic relevance of these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MATH TECH IN NAT LNG PR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22836/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.93", "rDifficulty": "1.47", "rStimulateInterest": "1.80", "rRecommendMajor": "2.47", "rCourseQuality": "2.11", "rWorkRequired": "1.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.07", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.39"}, "section": {"name": "MATH TECH IN NAT LNG PR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-477-401", "path": "/courses/22836/sections/401", "id": "22836-401", "aliases": ["CIS-477-401", "LING-549-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22836/sections/401/reviews/1359-ARAVIND-K-JOSHI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1359-ARAVIND-K-JOSHI", "first_name": "ARAVIND K", "last_name": "JOSHI", "id": "1359-ARAVIND-K-JOSHI", "name": "ARAVIND K JOSHI"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "22836-401-1359-ARAVIND-K-JOSHI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-477", "path": "/courses/22836", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22836/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATH TECH IN NAT LNG PR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-477-401", "path": "/courses/22836/sections/401", "id": "22836-401", "aliases": ["CIS-477-401", "LING-549-401"]}]}, "id": 22836, "aliases": ["CIS-477", "LING-549"]}
