Topics will include: software development lifecycle; agile and test-driven development; source control and continuous integration; requirements analysis; object-oriented design and testability; Android application development; software testing; refactoring; and software quality metrics.\r\n\r\nStudents considered this class as one \u201cthat can actually apply [to real life]\u201d and enjoyed \u201chow it [placed the material] in a real world perspective.\u201d Some found \u201cthe ongoing Android project\u201d interesting, but also thought the workload too heavy when combined with regular homework. Even though some noted that they had already learnt the basic knowledge taught by this introductory course, it still helped them to \u201csolidify knowledge of software engineering as a field.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe majority of students thought that Professor Murphy did a great job teaching the material. However, some indicated problems in course organization, such as unnecessary guest lectures and too much focus on testing. The supplemental readings provided were quite helpful.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisite for this course is CIS 240. Students are expected to be proficient in Java and have completed both CIS 121 and CIS 240. This course, however, is recommended to all undergraduate Computer Science majors.\r\n", "num_students": 70, "path": "/courses/27159/sections/001/reviews/5320-CHRISTIAN-MURPHY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5320-CHRISTIAN-MURPHY", "first_name": "CHRISTIAN", "last_name": "MURPHY", "id": "5320-CHRISTIAN-MURPHY", "name": "CHRISTIAN MURPHY"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "27159-001-5320-CHRISTIAN-MURPHY"}]
