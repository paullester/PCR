The main topics covered are as follows:\r\nprocess synchronization; interprocess communication; concurrent/distributed\r\nprogramming languages; resource allocation and deadlock; virtual memory; protection\r\nand security; distributed operation; distributed data; performance evaluation.\r\nStudents found this course \u201cextremely interesting.\u201d They felt that they learned a\r\nlot and that the course was rewarding. Students noted that they learned more in this\r\ncomputer science class than in other courses in the department.\r\nStudents enjoyed Professor Loo as a lecturer for this course. Some students felt\r\nthat the content in lectures was disconnected from the content covered in projects, which\r\nthey found frustrating.\r\nThe course was highly recommended for computer science majors. Almost every\r\nrespondent noted that the course is very time-intensive. There were three big projects,\r\nwhich became more time-consuming and intense over the semester.", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/24172/sections/001/reviews/3918-BOON-THAU-LOO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3918-BOON-THAU-LOO", "first_name": "BOON THAU", "last_name": "LOO", "id": "3918-BOON-THAU-LOO", "name": "BOON THAU LOO"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "24172-001-3918-BOON-THAU-LOO"}]
