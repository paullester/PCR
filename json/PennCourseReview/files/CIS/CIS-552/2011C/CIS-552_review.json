Haskell was used for coding for much of the\r\nclass, which some found challenging.\r\nAccording to past students in her section, Professor Weirich is an effective\r\nteacher. However, students wished that she led better homework discussion, as they did\r\nnot find the discussions helpful.\r\nStudents did not find the course overly difficult; rather, they found the difficulty\r\nlevel and work load \u201cjust right.\u201d They noted that the assignments were challenging. Pair\r\nprogramming was required in this class; some felt they benefited by working in pairs,\r\nwhile others wished that they could have worked alone.", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/24183/sections/001/reviews/1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "first_name": "STEPHANIE", "last_name": "WEIRICH", "id": "1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH", "name": "STEPHANIE WEIRICH"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "24183-001-1820-STEPHANIE-WEIRICH"}]
