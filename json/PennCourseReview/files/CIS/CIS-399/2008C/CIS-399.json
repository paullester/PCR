{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4708"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to provide students with a solid technical foundation for developing, animating and controlling articulated systems used in interactive computer games, physical simulations and high-end animation applications. The course balances theory with practice by \"looking under the hood\" of a number of popular commercial animation packages and examines the technologies and techniques used from both a computer science and engineering perspective. Topics covered include: geometric coordinate systems and transformations; quaternions; parametric curves and surfaces; forward and inverse kinematics; dynamic systems and control; computer simulation; keyframe, motion capture and procedural animation; behavior-based animation and control; facial animation; smart characters and intelligent agents. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "SPECIAL TOPICS:  Linux/Unix in the 21st Century", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18447/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.87", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.68", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.70", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "SPECIAL TOPICS:  Linux/Unix in the 21st Century", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-399-001", "path": "/courses/18447/sections/001", "id": "18447-001", "aliases": ["CIS-399-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/18447/sections/001/reviews/1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN", "first_name": "JEAN", "last_name": "GRIFFIN", "id": "1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN", "name": "JEAN GRIFFIN"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "18447-001-1353-JEAN-GRIFFIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-399", "path": "/courses/18447", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18447/sections", "values": [{"name": "SPECIAL TOPICS:  Linux/Unix in the 21st Century", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-399-001", "path": "/courses/18447/sections/001", "id": "18447-001", "aliases": ["CIS-399-001"]}]}, "id": 18447, "aliases": ["CIS-399"]}
