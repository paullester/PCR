{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3838"}, "description": "You know how to program, but do you know how computers really work? How do millions of transistors come together to form a complete computing system? This bottom-up course begins with transistors and simple computer hardware structures, continues with low-level programming using primative machine instructions, and finishes with an introduction to all aspects of computer systems architecture and serves as the foundation for subsequent computer systems courses, such as Digital Systems Organization and Design (CIS 371), Computer Operating Systems (CIS 380), and Compilers and Interpreters (CIS 341). \n\nThe course will consider the SPARC architecture, boolean logic, number systems,and computer arithmetic; macro assembly language programming and subroutine linkages; the operating system interface and input/output; understanding the output of the C compiler; the use of the C programming language to generate specific assembly language instructions. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30056/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "3.56", "rTAQuality": "2.72", "rStimulateInterest": "2.16", "rRecommendMajor": "3.37", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.54", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-240-001", "path": "/courses/30056/sections/001", "id": "30056-001", "aliases": ["CIS-240-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 86, "path": "/courses/30056/sections/001/reviews/6263-THOMAS-FARMER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6263-THOMAS-FARMER", "first_name": "THOMAS", "last_name": "FARMER", "id": "6263-THOMAS-FARMER", "name": "THOMAS FARMER"}, "num_reviewers": 66, "id": "30056-001-6263-THOMAS-FARMER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-240", "path": "/courses/30056", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30056/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-240-001", "path": "/courses/30056/sections/001", "id": "30056-001", "aliases": ["CIS-240-001"]}]}, "id": 30056, "aliases": ["CIS-240"]}
