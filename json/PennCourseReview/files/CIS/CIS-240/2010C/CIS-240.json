How do millions of transistors come together to form a complete computing system? This bottom-up course begins with transistors and simple computer hardware structures, continues with low-level programming using primative machine instructions, and finishes with an introduction to all aspects of computer systems architecture and serves as the foundation for subsequent computer systems courses, such as Digital Systems Organization and Design (CIS 371), Computer Operating Systems (CIS 380), and Compilers and Interpreters (CIS 341). \n\nThe course will consider the SPARC architecture, boolean logic, number systems,and computer arithmetic; macro assembly language programming and subroutine linkages; the operating system interface and input/output; understanding the output of the C compiler; the use of the C programming language to generate specific assembly language instructions. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22825/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "3.22", "rStimulateInterest": "2.59", "rRecommendMajor": "3.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.72", "rWorkRequired": "3.55", "rInstructorAccess": "2.66", "rReadingsValue": "2.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "3.04", "rInstructorQuality": "3.07"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-240-001", "path": "/courses/22825/sections/001", "id": "22825-001", "aliases": ["CIS-240-001"]}, "comments": "CIS 240 begins with transistors and simple computer hardware structures, continues with low-level programming using primitive machine instructions, and finishes with an introduction to all aspects of computer systems architecture and serves as the foundation for subsequent computer systems courses. \r\n\r\nStudents found this course to be \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201cvery difficult,\u201d yet many felt that they \u201clearned a lot in the course.\u201d Although the material was \u201chard,\u201d the course was described as \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cfascinating,\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d Many students found the assignments to be \u201ctricky and time-consuming\u201d and complained about the lack of time given for harder assignments.
