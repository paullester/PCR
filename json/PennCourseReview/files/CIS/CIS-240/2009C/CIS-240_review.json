It is a precursor to computer systems courses that expand on the content.\r\n\r\nStudents reported learning a lot from the class, although they felt it was a bit rushed and compressed. Students liked the overall practicality of the material taught except for a section that was created by the professor himself.\r\n\r\nStudents had mixed reviews about Professor Roth. Some considered him a poor teacher while others noted that once you got used to his sarcastic/humorous personality, he was very engaging and patient in explaining complex topics.  All students agreed that they learned a lot from this course. \r\n\r\nStudents complained about the inordinate amount of work for this class as well as the difficult exam questions that were not similar to the homework. This course is a required class for most computer science related majors and has a prerequisite of CIS 110. \r\n", "num_students": 113, "path": "/courses/17127/sections/001/reviews/1322-AMIR-ROTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1322-AMIR-ROTH", "first_name": "AMIR", "last_name": "ROTH", "id": "1322-AMIR-ROTH", "name": "AMIR ROTH"}, "num_reviewers": 102, "id": "17127-001-1322-AMIR-ROTH"}]
