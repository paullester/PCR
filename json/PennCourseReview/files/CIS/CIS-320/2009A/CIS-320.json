{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4192"}, "description": "How do you optimally encode a text file? How do you find shortest paths in a map? How do you desgin a communication network? How do you route data in a network? What are the limits of efficient computation? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis of algorithms, and answers along the way to these and many other interesting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving; advanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees; advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and network flos; NP-completeness theory; and approximation algorithms. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "INTRO TO ALGORITHMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15503/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.02", "rDifficulty": "3.61", "rStimulateInterest": "3.16", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "3.12", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.84", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-320-001", "path": "/courses/15503/sections/001", "id": "15503-001", "aliases": ["CIS-320-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 63, "path": "/courses/15503/sections/001/reviews/305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "first_name": "SANJEEV", "last_name": "KHANNA", "id": "305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "name": "SANJEEV KHANNA"}, "num_reviewers": 59, "id": "15503-001-305-SANJEEV-KHANNA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-320", "path": "/courses/15503", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15503/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-320-001", "path": "/courses/15503/sections/001", "id": "15503-001", "aliases": ["CIS-320-001"]}]}, "id": 15503, "aliases": ["CIS-320"]}
