Students enjoyed how this course made you really think, \u201cThe main benefit from this course is that it really makes you think! It is a very interesting course that shows how you can solve a problem much faster if you think about it in a smarter way!\u201d Students stated that the textbook was a great way to refresh previously learned topics in computer science.\r\n\r\nProf. Khanna was lauded as a great professor.  A student stated, \u201cProfessor Khanna did an excellent job of promoting student interest in a difficult subject matter to teach.\u201d A few students desired for my examples were provided in class to supplement the class material.\r\n\r\nThis class is intended for juniors in the computer science department but can be taken by students who have completed the prerequisites CIS 120, 161, and 262. In general, students thought that homework was long but very informative. This course\u2019s grading structure is based off 6 homework assignments, 2 midterms and a final. Several students stated that they wished homework were weighted higher in the grade since it is more representative of computer science programming skills.  Students said this class was a \u201chuge time commitment,\u201d and \u201cchallenging\u201d but still called the course \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cintellectually rewarding,\u201d and \u201cworth it.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 115, "path": "/courses/27157/sections/001/reviews/305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "first_name": "SANJEEV", "last_name": "KHANNA", "id": "305-SANJEEV-KHANNA", "name": "SANJEEV KHANNA"}, "num_reviewers": 105, "id": "27157-001-305-SANJEEV-KHANNA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-320", "path": "/courses/27157", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27157/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-320-001", "path": "/courses/27157/sections/001", "id": "27157-001", "aliases": ["CIS-320-001"]}]}, "id": 27157, "aliases": ["CIS-320"]}
