{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4192"}, "description": "How do you optimally encode a text file? How do you find shortest paths in a map? How do you desgin a communication network? How do you route data in a network? What are the limits of efficient computation? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis of algorithms, and answers along the way to these and many other interesting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving; advanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees; advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and network flos; NP-completeness theory; and approximation algorithms. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO TO ALGORITHMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30058/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.54", "rDifficulty": "3.71", "rTAQuality": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "3.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "3.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.61"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ALGORITHMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-320-001", "path": "/courses/30058/sections/001", "id": "30058-001", "aliases": ["CIS-320-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 145, "path": "/courses/30058/sections/001/reviews/6470-RAJIV-C--GANDHI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6470-RAJIV-C--GANDHI", "first_name": "RAJIV C.", "last_name": "GANDHI", "id": "6470-RAJIV-C--GANDHI", "name": "RAJIV C.
