{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1744"}, "description": "This course is an introductory graduate course on computer architecture with an emphasis on a quantitative approach to cost/performance design tradeoffs. The course covers the fundamentals of classical and modern uniprocessor design: performance and cost issues, instruction sets, pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order, and speculative execution mechanisms, caches, physical memory, virtual memory, and I/O. Other topics include: static scheduling, VLIW and EPIC, software speculation, long (SIMD) and short (multimedia) vector execution, multithreading, and an introduction to shared memory multiprocessors. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8677/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.08", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.17", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.42", "rInstructorAccess": "2.17", "rReadingsValue": "1.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.83", "rCommAbility": "2.42", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-501-001", "path": "/courses/8677/sections/001", "id": "8677-001", "aliases": ["CIS-501-001"]}, "comments": "Students found the general content of the course to be interesting.
