{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1744"}, "description": "This course is an introductory graduate course on computer architecture with an emphasis on a quantitative approach to cost/performance design tradeoffs. The course covers the fundamentals of classical and modern uniprocessor design: performance and cost issues, instruction sets, pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order, and speculative execution mechanisms, caches, physical memory, virtual memory, and I/O. Other topics include: static scheduling, VLIW and EPIC, software speculation, long (SIMD) and short (multimedia) vector execution, multithreading, and an introduction to shared memory multiprocessors. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5108/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.82", "rDifficulty": "3.28", "rStimulateInterest": "2.84", "rRecommendMajor": "2.84", "rCourseQuality": "2.86", "rWorkRequired": "3.12", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "2.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "3.02", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23"}, "section": {"name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-501-001", "path": "/courses/5108/sections/001", "id": "5108-001", "aliases": ["CIS-501-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/5108/sections/001/reviews/1322-AMIR-ROTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1322-AMIR-ROTH", "first_name": "AMIR", "last_name": "ROTH", "id": "1322-AMIR-ROTH", "name": "AMIR ROTH"}, "num_reviewers": 44, "id": "5108-001-1322-AMIR-ROTH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-501", "path": "/courses/5108", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5108/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-501-001", "path": "/courses/5108/sections/001", "id": "5108-001", "aliases": ["CIS-501-001"]}]}, "id": 5108, "aliases": ["CIS-501"]}
