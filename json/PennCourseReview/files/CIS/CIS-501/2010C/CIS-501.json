{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1744"}, "description": "This course is an introductory graduate course on computer architecture with an emphasis on a quantitative approach to cost/performance design tradeoffs. The course covers the fundamentals of classical and modern uniprocessor design: performance and cost issues, instruction sets, pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order, and speculative execution mechanisms, caches, physical memory, virtual memory, and I/O. Other topics include: static scheduling, VLIW and EPIC, software speculation, long (SIMD) and short (multimedia) vector execution, multithreading, and an introduction to shared memory multiprocessors. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22838/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "3.10", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-501-001", "path": "/courses/22838/sections/001", "id": "22838-001", "aliases": ["CIS-501-001"]}, "comments": "This course is an introductory graduate course on computer architecture with an emphasis on a quantitative approach to cost/performance design tradeoffs.
