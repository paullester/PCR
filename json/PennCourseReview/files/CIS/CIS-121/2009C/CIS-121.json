{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3836"}, "description": "This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language. We introduce elementary concepts about the complexity of an algorithm and methods for analyzing the running time of software. We describe data structures like stacks, queues, lists, trees, priority queues, maps, hash tables and graphs, and we discuss how to implement them efficiently and how to use them in problems-solving software. A larger project introducing students to some of the challenges of software development concludes the course. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17124/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.05", "rDifficulty": "2.79", "rStimulateInterest": "1.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.30", "rCourseQuality": "2.21", "rWorkRequired": "3.03", "rInstructorAccess": "2.62", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.43", "rCommAbility": "1.74", "rInstructorQuality": "1.98"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/17124/sections/001", "id": "17124-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}, "comments": "This course is the second part of an introductory sequence on basic algorithms and data structures in the Java programming language. The class culminates in a final large project that introduces some of the challenges of software development.\r\n\r\nSome students were satisfied with the content covered by the course, while others were disappointed in the organization.\r\n\r\nStudents thought Professor Daniilidis was an extremely nice person, giving frequent extensions for homework assignment. However, they did mention that these assignments were not very clear and were reflected in Professor Daniilidis\u2019 erratic teaching style.\r\n\r\nThis course is targeted towards students interested in deepening their knowledge of programming from a prerequisite, CIS 120.
