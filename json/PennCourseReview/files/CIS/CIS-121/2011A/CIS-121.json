{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3836"}, "description": "This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language. We introduce elementary concepts about the complexity of an algorithm and methods for analyzing the running time of software. We describe data structures like stacks, queues, lists, trees, priority queues, maps, hash tables and graphs, and we discuss how to implement them efficiently and how to use them in problems-solving software. A larger project introducing students to some of the challenges of software development concludes the course. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21445/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "3.05", "rStimulateInterest": "1.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.04", "rWorkRequired": "3.18", "rInstructorAccess": "2.49", "rReadingsValue": "1.59", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "1.88", "rInstructorQuality": "1.96"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/21445/sections/001", "id": "21445-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}, "comments": "This is an introductory course using Java.

In addition, students felt that the TAs were \u201ccondescending and unsupportive\u201d and \u201crarely made themselves available.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;Students agreed that homework assignments, which were not assigned at regular intervals, were \u201cvery frustrating\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily difficult.\u201d Assignments were often updated or corrected mere days before they were due, angering students. Multiple students reported that \u201ceven the TAs couldn\u2019t complete\u201d the assignments, which students also described as \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201chorrendously designed.\u201d In addition, students felt the grading was \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/21445/sections/001/reviews/3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR", "first_name": "BENJAMIN", "last_name": "TASKAR", "id": "3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR", "name": "BENJAMIN TASKAR"}, "num_reviewers": 50, "id": "21445-001-3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-121", "path": "/courses/21445", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21445/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/21445/sections/001", "id": "21445-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}]}, "id": 21445, "aliases": ["CIS-121"]}
