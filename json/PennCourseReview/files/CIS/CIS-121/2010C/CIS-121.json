{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3836"}, "description": "This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language. We introduce elementary concepts about the complexity of an algorithm and methods for analyzing the running time of software. We describe data structures like stacks, queues, lists, trees, priority queues, maps, hash tables and graphs, and we discuss how to implement them efficiently and how to use them in problems-solving software. A larger project introducing students to some of the challenges of software development concludes the course. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22820/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.81", "rDifficulty": "2.96", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.49", "rWorkRequired": "3.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.40", "rReadingsValue": "1.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.53", "rCommAbility": "1.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.11"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/22820/sections/001", "id": "22820-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}, "comments": "CIS 121 is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language.

One student felt that too much of the learning \u201chappened on our own, in our own time.\u201d However, many students appreciated that the class was not \u201ctoo intense\u201d and that the exams \u201cweren\u2019t too hard.\u201d \r\n\r\nAccording to a majority of students, the lectures were \u201clow quality\u201d and lacked \u201cpassion.\u201d Students felt that Professor Daniilidis was a \u201cvery fair person\u201d with \u201ca nice sense of humor,\u201d but that he was \u201cunreachable outside of lecture, office hours, and recitation.\u201d The quality of teaching was described as \u201ca disappointment\u201d and \u201csubpar.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents generally agreed that this class was \u201cvery valuable\u201d and \u201creally good\u201d for CIS majors.
