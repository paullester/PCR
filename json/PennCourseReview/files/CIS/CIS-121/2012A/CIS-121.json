{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3836"}, "description": "This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language. We introduce elementary concepts about the complexity of an algorithm and methods for analyzing the running time of software. We describe data structures like stacks, queues, lists, trees, priority queues, maps, hash tables and graphs, and we discuss how to implement them efficiently and how to use them in problems-solving software. A larger project introducing students to some of the challenges of software development concludes the course. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27150/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.66", "rDifficulty": "2.66", "rStimulateInterest": "1.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "1.76", "rWorkRequired": "2.84", "rInstructorAccess": "2.54", "rReadingsValue": "1.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.47", "rCommAbility": "2.10", "rInstructorQuality": "1.88"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/27150/sections/001", "id": "27150-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}, "comments": "This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language.

Most complaints had to do with the emphasis placed on the homeworks, as opposed to the actual content included in the syllabus.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stoyanovich was largely criticized just because of the weak organization of the course. Most TA\u2019s were helpful and held productive office hours, but many students noted that \u201cthe grading seemed arbitrary for the homeworks.\u201d Additionally, a few TA\u2019s seemed \u201coften clueless.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students wished there were fewer homework and criticized the grading system for the homeworks. Some expressed the sentiment that the course is \u201cchallenging, \u201cdifficult,\u201d or \u201ctime-consuming and frustrating.\u201d Overall, though, students felt as though they learned a significant amount from this class.\r\n", "num_students": 139, "path": "/courses/27150/sections/001/reviews/6070-JULIA-D--STOYANOVICH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6070-JULIA-D--STOYANOVICH", "first_name": "JULIA D.", "last_name": "STOYANOVICH", "id": "6070-JULIA-D--STOYANOVICH", "name": "JULIA D.
