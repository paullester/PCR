{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3836"}, "description": "This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Data Structures using the Java programming language. We introduce elementary concepts about the complexity of an algorithm and methods for analyzing the running time of software. We describe data structures like stacks, queues, lists, trees, priority queues, maps, hash tables and graphs, and we discuss how to implement them efficiently and how to use them in problems-solving software. A larger project introducing students to some of the challenges of software development concludes the course. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15499/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.62", "rDifficulty": "2.95", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.31", "rWorkRequired": "3.29", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "1.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.56", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.68"}, "section": {"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/15499/sections/001", "id": "15499-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}, "comments": "This course builds on the concepts introduced in CIS 120. It focuses on data structures and introduces algorithm analysis such as software efficiency. It caps off with a large project in the end.\r\n\r\nStudents reported that most of the content is relatively boring and a repeat of AP Computer Science AB material. There was not enough implementation and too much usage of premade functions.\r\n\r\nStudents called \u201cVal\u201d a \u201cfriendly, accessible instructor.\u201d Many enjoyed his lectures on the subpar material.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the midterms were too easy and the curve too difficult. The mandatory attendance at 10 am was not well received and resulted in a lower instructor rating than the professor had hoped with such a requirement. The required text is Data Structures and Problem Solving Using Java by Mark Weiss.", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/15499/sections/001/reviews/297-VAL-BREAZU-TANNEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/297-VAL-BREAZU-TANNEN", "first_name": "VAL BREAZU", "last_name": "TANNEN", "id": "297-VAL-BREAZU-TANNEN", "name": "VAL BREAZU TANNEN"}, "num_reviewers": 63, "id": "15499-001-297-VAL-BREAZU-TANNEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-121", "path": "/courses/15499", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15499/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROG LANG AND TECH II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-121-001", "path": "/courses/15499/sections/001", "id": "15499-001", "aliases": ["CIS-121-001"]}]}, "id": 15499, "aliases": ["CIS-121"]}
