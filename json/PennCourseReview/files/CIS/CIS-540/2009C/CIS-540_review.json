While the classical theory of computation focuses on the function that a program computes, to understand embedded computation, the reactive nature of the interaction of a component with its environment, the continuous dynamics of the physical world, different ways of communication among components, and requirements concerning safety, timeliness, stability, and performance are often overlooked. Developing tools for approaching design, analysis, and implementation of embedded systems in a principled manner is an active research area. This course will attempt to give students a coherent introduction to this emerging area.\r\n\r\nStudents found the material scattered and sometimes hard to follow, and would have preferred prepared presentation and in class demonstrations. Also, there was a lack of paper reviews or reading material for reference. \r\n\r\nStudents liked Professor Alur and found the course to be \u201ccomprehensive.\u201d \r\n", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/17141/sections/001/reviews/1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "first_name": "RAJEEV S.", "last_name": "ALUR", "id": "1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "name": "RAJEEV S.
