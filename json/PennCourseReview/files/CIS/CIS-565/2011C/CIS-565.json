{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4915"}, "description": "This course examines the architecture and programming model of modern graphics processing units (GPUs). The GPU has grown in power over recent years, to the point where many computations can be performed faster on the GPU than on a traditional CPU. GPUs have also become programmable, allowing them to be used for a diverse set of applications far removed from traditional graphics. Course topics include the architecture of modern desktop and mobile GPUs; real-time rendering with OpenGL and GLSL; and writing general-purpose, massively-parallel programs on the GPU using CUDA and OpenCL. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "GPU PROGRAMMING&ARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24187/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.20", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.40", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "GPU PROGRAMMING&ARCH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-565-001", "path": "/courses/24187/sections/001", "id": "24187-001", "aliases": ["CIS-565-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/24187/sections/001/reviews/5321-JOSEPH-THEODORE-KIDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5321-JOSEPH-THEODORE-KIDER", "first_name": "JOSEPH THEODORE", "last_name": "KIDER", "id": "5321-JOSEPH-THEODORE-KIDER", "name": "JOSEPH THEODORE KIDER"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "24187-001-5321-JOSEPH-THEODORE-KIDER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-565", "path": "/courses/24187", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24187/sections", "values": [{"name": "GPU PROGRAMMING&ARCH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-565-001", "path": "/courses/24187/sections/001", "id": "24187-001", "aliases": ["CIS-565-001"]}]}, "id": 24187, "aliases": ["CIS-565"]}
