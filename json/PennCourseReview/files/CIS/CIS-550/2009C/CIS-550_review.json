Topics include the Entity-Relationship approach as a modeling tool, the relational model, algebra, calculus, commercial systems, database design and relational normalization, physical data organization and indexing structures. \r\n\r\nStudents found the class very informative and interesting, although \u201ca little too theoretical and not practical enough,\u201d sometimes employing \u201cunnecessary complexity.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Ives was described as both knowledgeable and a great teacher. Students acknowledged that Ives clearly enjoyed teaching the class, which enhanced their enjoyment of the class.\r\n\r\nThe final project for this course accounted for the majority of work for the project, although students described this final project as the best part of the course. The problem sets were interesting, and well paced. The work, however, was graded slowly and unreliably. CIT591 or equivalent is a prerequisite for this course. \r\n", "num_students": 72, "path": "/courses/17142/sections/001/reviews/2073-ZACHARY-G--IVES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2073-ZACHARY-G--IVES", "first_name": "ZACHARY G.", "last_name": "IVES", "id": "2073-ZACHARY-G--IVES", "name": "ZACHARY G.
