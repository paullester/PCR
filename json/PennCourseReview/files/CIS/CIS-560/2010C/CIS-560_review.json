Topics cover: geometric transformations, geometric algorithms, software systems (OpenGL), 3D object models (surface and volume), visible surface algorithms, image synthesis, shading and mapping, ray tracing, radiosity, global illumination, photon mapping, anti-aliasing and compositing.\r\n\r\nStudents generally agreed that they learned a lot from the course and that the material was interesting and useful. Many students found the assignments to be challenging but fulfilling, and they felt that the course was \u201ca lot of work.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students reported that Professor Badler\u2019s lectures were not very useful, as he relied on the slides. Professor Badler was generally regarded by students as \u201cnice,\u201d while most students felt that the TAs were not as helpful.\r\n\r\nOne year of programming experience is required to take this course.\r\n", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/22844/sections/401/reviews/1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "first_name": "NORMAN I", "last_name": "BADLER", "id": "1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER", "name": "NORMAN I BADLER"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "22844-401-1325-NORMAN-I-BADLER"}]
