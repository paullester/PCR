Students learn the principles, methods, and techniques for building life-critical embedded systems, ranging from requirements and models to design, analysis, optimization, implementation, and validation. Topics include modeling and analysis methods and tools, real-time programming paradigms and languages, distributed real-time systems, global time, time-triggered communications, assurance case, software architecture, evidence-based certification, testing, verification, and validation. The course includes a series of projects that implements life-critical embedded systems (e.g. pacemaker, infusion pumps, closed-loop medical devices).\r\n\r\nStudents generally were very pleased with their experience in this class. They seemed to agree that the most \u201cvaluable\u201d parts of the course were the assigned projects. Some students also expressed that the \u201cscope of the course was appropriately broad.\u201d According to most, the readings that Professor Lee assigned were clear and very useful. \r\n\r\nMany of the students that took this class felt that Professor Lee was often \u201cunorganized.\u201d They also felt that sometimes his lecture slides were \u201coverly verbose\u201d and unclear. However, most agreed that the Professor\u2019s readings compensated for this confusion. \r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that the organization of this class was very different from that of other undergraduate courses. Only one exam was given, and students felt that it was difficult because they were forced to suddenly condense everything that they had learned throughout the semester.\r\n", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/22834/sections/401/reviews/1821-INSUP-LEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1821-INSUP-LEE", "first_name": "INSUP", "last_name": "LEE", "id": "1821-INSUP-LEE", "name": "INSUP LEE"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "22834-401-1821-INSUP-LEE"}]
