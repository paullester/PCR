{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5091"}, "description": "This course is focused on cyber physical systems with emphasis on real-time issues. Cyber physical systems are integrations of computation and communication with physical processes. Embedded computers monitor and control physical processes in real-time. As these embedded computer transformed from word processors to global communications devices for information gathering and sharing, embedded computers will change from small self-contained systems to cyber-physical systems by sensing, \n\nThe course is to study principles, methods, and techniques for building high-assurance cyber-physical systems. Topics will include requirements capture and modeling, mental models, assurance cases, hazard analysis, real-time programming and communication, real-time scheduling and virtual machines, feedback control in computer systems, verification and validseries of projects that will implement safety-critical embedded systems (e.g., pacemaker, infusion pump). \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "EMBEDDED SOFTWARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28724/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.79", "rDifficulty": "2.12", "rTAQuality": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "1.38", "rRecommendMajor": "1.74", "rCourseQuality": "1.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.03", "rInstructorAccess": "2.03", "rReadingsValue": "1.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.32", "rCommAbility": "1.62", "rInstructorQuality": "1.89"}, "section": {"name": "EMBEDDED SOFTWARE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-441-401", "path": "/courses/28724/sections/401", "id": "28724-401", "aliases": ["CIS-441-401", "CIS-541-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/28724/sections/401/reviews/1821-INSUP-LEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1821-INSUP-LEE", "first_name": "INSUP", "last_name": "LEE", "id": "1821-INSUP-LEE", "name": "INSUP LEE"}, "num_reviewers": 37, "id": "28724-401-1821-INSUP-LEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-441", "path": "/courses/28724", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28724/sections", "values": [{"name": "EMBEDDED SOFTWARE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-441-401", "path": "/courses/28724/sections/401", "id": "28724-401", "aliases": ["CIS-441-401", "CIS-541-401"]}]}, "id": 28724, "aliases": ["CIS-441", "CIS-541"]}
