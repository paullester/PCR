{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3840"}, "description": "This course explores questions fundamental to computer science such as which problems cannot be solved by computers, can we formalize computing as a mathematical concept without relying upon the specifics of programming languages and computing platforms, and which problems can be solved efficiently. The topics include finite automata and regular languages, context-free grammars and pushdown automata, Turing machines and undecidability, tractability and NP-completeness. The course emphasizes rigorous mathematical reasoning as well as connections to practical computing problems such as test processing, parsing, XML query languages, and program verification. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17129/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.96", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "1.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.35", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-262-001", "path": "/courses/17129/sections/001", "id": "17129-001", "aliases": ["CIS-262-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 96, "path": "/courses/17129/sections/001/reviews/1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "first_name": "RAJEEV S.", "last_name": "ALUR", "id": "1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "name": "RAJEEV S.
