Questions such as the formalization of\r\ncomputing as a mathematical concept without relying upon the specifics of programming\r\nlanguages and computing platforms, and which problems can be solved efficiently, are\r\nexplored. The topics include finite automata and regular languages, context-free\r\ngrammars and pushdown automata, Turing machines and undecidability, tractability and\r\nNP-completeness. The course emphasizes rigorous mathematical reasoning as well as\r\nconnections to practical computing problems such as test processing, parsing, XML\r\nquery languages, and program verification.\r\nOverall, students found this course \u201cinteresting,\u201d and computer science majors\r\nfound the course \u201cuseful.\u201d The majority of the material covered is \u201cabstract/theoretical.\u201d\r\nBy working hard in the course, students felt they were able to obtain a \u201cgood grasp of the\r\nconcepts.\u201d\r\nAlthough students found Professor Alur willing to answer all questions, they felt\r\nthat he was not very accessible. Students noted that they were unable to attend any of the\r\nprofessor\u2019s posted office hours. Additionally, many found the recitation to be an\r\n\u201cadditional lecture,\u201d so they were unable to have their questions answered during\r\nrecitation.\r\nThe majority of students found the course \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cchallenging,\u201d especially\r\nnon-math majors and non-computer science majors. Students found the textbook to be\r\nhelpful and the recitations \u201ccrucial.\u201d Students found the course difficult due to the\r\nmaterial, rather than the workload.
