{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3840"}, "description": "This course explores questions fundamental to computer science such as which problems cannot be solved by computers, can we formalize computing as a mathematical concept without relying upon the specifics of programming languages and computing platforms, and which problems can be solved efficiently. The topics include finite automata and regular languages, context-free grammars and pushdown automata, Turing machines and undecidability, tractability and NP-completeness. The course emphasizes rigorous mathematical reasoning as well as connections to practical computing problems such as test processing, parsing, XML query languages, and program verification. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28717/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.58", "rDifficulty": "3.29", "rTAQuality": "2.23", "rStimulateInterest": "1.93", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "2.51", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.05", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.47"}, "section": {"name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-262-001", "path": "/courses/28717/sections/001", "id": "28717-001", "aliases": ["CIS-262-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 154, "path": "/courses/28717/sections/001/reviews/6072-AARON-L-ROTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6072-AARON-L-ROTH", "first_name": "AARON L", "last_name": "ROTH", "id": "6072-AARON-L-ROTH", "name": "AARON L ROTH"}, "num_reviewers": 127, "id": "28717-001-6072-AARON-L-ROTH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-262", "path": "/courses/28717", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28717/sections", "values": [{"name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-262-001", "path": "/courses/28717/sections/001", "id": "28717-001", "aliases": ["CIS-262-001"]}]}, "id": 28717, "aliases": ["CIS-262"]}
