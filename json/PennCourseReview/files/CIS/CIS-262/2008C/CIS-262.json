{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3840"}, "description": "This course explores questions fundamental to computer science such as which problems cannot be solved by computers, can we formalize computing as a mathematical concept without relying upon the specifics of programming languages and computing platforms, and which problems can be solved efficiently. The topics include finite automata and regular languages, context-free grammars and pushdown automata, Turing machines and undecidability, tractability and NP-completeness. The course emphasizes rigorous mathematical reasoning as well as connections to practical computing problems such as test processing, parsing, XML query languages, and program verification. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18439/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "3.42", "rStimulateInterest": "1.91", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "3.04", "rInstructorAccess": "3.05", "rReadingsValue": "2.61", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.69", "rCommAbility": "2.69", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-262-001", "path": "/courses/18439/sections/001", "id": "18439-001", "aliases": ["CIS-262-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 81, "path": "/courses/18439/sections/001/reviews/1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "first_name": "RAJEEV S.", "last_name": "ALUR", "id": "1358-RAJEEV-S--ALUR", "name": "RAJEEV S.
