{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3840"}, "description": "This course explores questions fundamental to computer science such as which problems cannot be solved by computers, can we formalize computing as a mathematical concept without relying upon the specifics of programming languages and computing platforms, and which problems can be solved efficiently. The topics include finite automata and regular languages, context-free grammars and pushdown automata, Turing machines and undecidability, tractability and NP-completeness. The course emphasizes rigorous mathematical reasoning as well as connections to practical computing problems such as test processing, parsing, XML query languages, and program verification. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13025/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "3.32", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "2.97", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "3.06", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "2.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.94", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.32"}, "section": {"name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-262-001", "path": "/courses/13025/sections/001", "id": "13025-001", "aliases": ["CIS-262-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 80, "path": "/courses/13025/sections/001/reviews/248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "first_name": "JEAN HENRI", "last_name": "GALLIER", "id": "248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "name": "JEAN HENRI GALLIER"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "13025-001-248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-262", "path": "/courses/13025", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13025/sections", "values": [{"name": "AUTOMATA,COMPUT.& COMPLX", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-262-001", "path": "/courses/13025/sections/001", "id": "13025-001", "aliases": ["CIS-262-001"]}]}, "id": 13025, "aliases": ["CIS-262"]}
