{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4198"}, "description": "This course introduces students to common physically based simulation techniques for animation of fluids and gases, rigid and deformable solids, cloth, explosions, fire, smoke, virtual characters, and other systems. Physicalbased simulation techniques allow for creation of extremely realistic special effects for movies, video games and surgical simulation systems. We will learn state-of-the-art techniques that are commonly used in current special effects and animation studios and in video games community. To gain hands-on experience, students will implement basic simulators for several systems. The topics will include: Particle Systems, Mass spring systems, Deformable Solids & Fracture, Cloth, Explosions & Fire, Smoke, Fluids, Deformable active characters, Simulation and control of rigid bodies, Rigid body dynamics, Collision detection and handling, Simulation of articulated characters, Simulated characters in games. The course is appropriate for both upper level undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PHYS BASED ANIMATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15515/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "3.79", "rStimulateInterest": "2.54", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "3.61", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.04", "rCommAbility": "2.17", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "PHYS BASED ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-563-001", "path": "/courses/15515/sections/001", "id": "15515-001", "aliases": ["CIS-563-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/15515/sections/001/reviews/4285-ALLA-SAFONOVA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4285-ALLA-SAFONOVA", "first_name": "ALLA", "last_name": "SAFONOVA", "id": "4285-ALLA-SAFONOVA", "name": "ALLA SAFONOVA"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "15515-001-4285-ALLA-SAFONOVA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CIS-563", "path": "/courses/15515", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15515/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYS BASED ANIMATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-563-001", "path": "/courses/15515/sections/001", "id": "15515-001", "aliases": ["CIS-563-001"]}]}, "id": 15515, "aliases": ["CIS-563"]}
