To gain hands-on experience, students will implement basic simulators for several systems. The topics will include: Particle Systems, Mass spring systems, Deformable Solids & Fracture, Cloth, Explosions & Fire, Smoke, Fluids, Deformable active characters, Simulation and control of rigid bodies, Rigid body dynamics, Collision detection and handling, Simulation of articulated characters, Simulated characters in games. &#8232;&#8232;Students had rave reviews for both the course content and the instructor. They described the course material as \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cexcellent,\u201d and \u201cfun.\u201d As one student put it, \u201cthis class really made me love coding.\u201d &#8232;&#8232;In addition, students had nothing but positive things to say about Professor Kider.
