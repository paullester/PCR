Covering the foundations of statistical machine learning, the course focuses on\r\nprobabilistic and statistical methods for prediction and clustering in high dimensions.\r\nOther topics covered include graphical models, dimensionality reduction, neural\r\nnetworks, and reinforcement learning. This course is aimed broadly at advanced\r\nundergraduates and beginning graduate students. The software used in the course in\r\nMATLAB.\r\nMost students enjoyed the course very much even though it was quite tough.\r\nStudents generally indicated that \u201cthe subjects covered by the assignments and the\r\nprojects were very interesting\u201d and the wiki layout for course lectures was wonderful.\r\nWhile some students pointed out that the problems in the homework are sometimes\r\n\u201cslightly tangential to the focus\u201d of the course and not closely related to exam questions,\r\nthe majority of the students thought this course stimulated their interest in machine\r\nlearning. One student even noted that this is \u201cone of the most enjoyable core courses at\r\nPenn.\u201d\r\nProfessor Taskar and his TAs were highly praised by the students. Some students\r\nreported that the professor and the TAs\u2019 emphasis on \u201cdeveloping intuitions\u201d despite \u201cthe\r\nstatistics-heavy nature\u201d was \u201cthe best part about this course.\u201d Many students greatly\r\ncomplimented the TAs\u2019 help, yet some wished that Professor Taskar could have \u201cshown\r\nup to office hours more often to answer questions and help students with their\r\nhomework.\u201d\r\nStudents felt that the course was heavily math-oriented and thus was only\r\nrecommended for students who meet the prerequisites - Elementary Probability, Calculus,\r\nLinear Algebra, and basic programming experience. The workload was high but the\r\nassigned projects were mostly interesting.", "num_students": 123, "path": "/courses/24180/sections/001/reviews/3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR", "first_name": "BENJAMIN", "last_name": "TASKAR", "id": "3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR", "name": "BENJAMIN TASKAR"}, "num_reviewers": 120, "id": "24180-001-3917-BENJAMIN-TASKAR"}]
