{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4189"}, "description": "Have you ever wondered why sharing music and video generates such political and legal controversies? Is information on your PC safe and should law enforcement be able to access information you enter on the Web? Will new devices allow tracking of your every move and every purchase? CIS 125 is focused on developing an understanding of existing and emerging technologies, along with the political, societal and economic impacts of those technologies. The technologies are spread across a number of engineering areas and each of them raise issues that are of current concern or are likely to be a future issue. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15500/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.54", "rRecommendMajor": "2.92", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "2.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "2.54", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CIS-125-401", "path": "/courses/15500/sections/401", "id": "15500-401", "aliases": ["CIS-125-401", "EAS-125-401"]}, "comments": "This course focused on how existing and emerging technologies exert political, societal and economic impacts.
