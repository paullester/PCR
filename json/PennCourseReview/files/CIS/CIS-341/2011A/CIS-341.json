{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4706"}, "description": "You know how to program, but do you know how to implement a programming language? In CIS341 you'll learn how to build a compiler. Topics covered include: lexical analysis, grammars and parsing, intermediate representations, syntax-directed translation, code generation, type checking, simple dataflow and control-flow analyses, and optimizations. Along the way, we study objects and inheritance, first-class functions (closures), data representation and runtime-support issues such as garbage collection. This is a challenging, implementation-oriented course in which students build a full compiler from a simple, typed object-oriented language to fully operational x86 assembly. The course projects are implemented using OCaml, but no knowledge of OCaml is assumed. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "COMPILERS & INTERPRETER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21454/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.76", "rDifficulty": "3.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.41", "rWorkRequired": "3.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.81", "rReadingsValue": "2.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.59", "rCommAbility": "3.35", "rInstructorQuality": "3.59"}, "section": {"name": "COMPILERS & INTERPRETER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CIS-341-001", "path": "/courses/21454/sections/001", "id": "21454-001", "aliases": ["CIS-341-001"]}, "comments": "Officially titled \u201cCompilers and Interpreters,\u201d CIS341 aims to show students what goes into implementing a programming language.
