{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1098"}, "description": "This is a case-based course in which students are presented with complex problems and led to use the systems approach and systems tools to find acceptable solutions. The case problems lie in the fields of transportation, telecommunications, manufacturing, environmental planning, and delivery of services. The solution processes require defining and modeling of the situations and lead to queuing and optimization issues. Students utilize a variety of computer simulation programs and mathematical methods to address each case. Group work, technical writing, and oral presentations are required throughout the course and a hands-on systems integration project. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "SYS APPR TO PROB SOLVING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1098/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "1.65", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.82", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.41", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "SYS APPR TO PROB SOLVING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-140-001", "path": "/courses/1098/sections/001", "id": "1098-001", "aliases": ["SYS-140-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/1098/sections/001/reviews/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "first_name": "JOHN D", "last_name": "KEENAN", "id": "1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN", "name": "JOHN D KEENAN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "1098-001-1167-JOHN-D-KEENAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SYS-140", "path": "/courses/1098", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1098/sections", "values": [{"name": "SYS APPR TO PROB SOLVING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-140-001", "path": "/courses/1098/sections/001", "id": "1098-001", "aliases": ["SYS-140-001"]}]}, "id": 1098, "aliases": ["SYS-140"]}
