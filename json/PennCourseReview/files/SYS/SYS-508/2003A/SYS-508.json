{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1530"}, "description": "This course will begin with an introduction to virtual reality personas and web-based agents, including their usage to assist, train, and entertain people wherever digital interfaces exist (on the Web, in e-commerce, in games, in kitchen appliances, on your dashboard, etc.). What makes an agent rational? Emotionally appealing? Entertaining? We will explore mathematical theories of rationality and behavior, including those from cognitive, behavioral and decision science. We will then progress into human behavior literature, personality and individual differences studies, and integlligent and emotive agent designs. We will examine various types of agents such as web shopping agents, emotive agents, personal support agents, chatterbots, mobile agents, virtual reality personas, game-based adversaries, pedagogical agent coaches, and multi-agent societies. Finally, students will learn principles about animation, simulated social interaction, speech generation, knowledge representation, agent planning and reasoning, agent communication languages, testing of the use of agent based systems, and methodologies/toolbenches for engineering of systems of intelligent and emotive agents. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "INTEL & ANTM SOFTWRE AGT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2294/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.22", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "INTEL & ANTM SOFTWRE AGT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-508-001", "path": "/courses/2294/sections/001", "id": "2294-001", "aliases": ["SYS-508-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/2294/sections/001/reviews/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "first_name": "BARRY G.", "last_name": "SILVERMAN", "id": "1970-BARRY-G--SILVERMAN", "name": "BARRY G.
