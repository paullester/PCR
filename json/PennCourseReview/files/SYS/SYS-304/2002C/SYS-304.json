{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1102"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to optimization problems vis., the mathematical models, their formulation, analysis and computational tools for their solutions. The course covers major mathematical models of optimization problems - linear programming, netowrk analysis and integer programming. Formulation issues and basic solution methodologies are covered in a fairly rigorous fasion for these classes of optimizaiton problems. Examples are selected from a broad range of engineering and business problems. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3576/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "2.92", "rStimulateInterest": "1.96", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.56", "rWorkRequired": "2.84", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.48", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.68", "rCommAbility": "2.28", "rInstructorQuality": "2.52"}, "section": {"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/3576/sections/001", "id": "3576-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/3576/sections/001/reviews/1174-RADE-HAJDIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1174-RADE-HAJDIN", "first_name": "RADE", "last_name": "HAJDIN", "id": "1174-RADE-HAJDIN", "name": "RADE HAJDIN"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "3576-001-1174-RADE-HAJDIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SYS-304", "path": "/courses/3576", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3576/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/3576/sections/001", "id": "3576-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}]}, "id": 3576, "aliases": ["SYS-304"]}
