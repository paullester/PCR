{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1102"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to optimization problems vis., the mathematical models, their formulation, analysis and computational tools for their solutions. The course covers major mathematical models of optimization problems - linear programming, netowrk analysis and integer programming. Formulation issues and basic solution methodologies are covered in a fairly rigorous fasion for these classes of optimizaiton problems. Examples are selected from a broad range of engineering and business problems. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2287/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "1.55", "rRecommendMajor": "3.08", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.51", "rCommAbility": "2.10", "rInstructorQuality": "2.10"}, "section": {"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/2287/sections/001", "id": "2287-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 69, "path": "/courses/2287/sections/001/reviews/1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR", "first_name": "SRISANKAR", "last_name": "KUNNIYUR", "id": "1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR", "name": "SRISANKAR KUNNIYUR"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "2287-001-1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SYS-304", "path": "/courses/2287", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2287/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/2287/sections/001", "id": "2287-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}]}, "id": 2287, "aliases": ["SYS-304"]}
