{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1102"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to optimization problems vis., the mathematical models, their formulation, analysis and computational tools for their solutions. The course covers major mathematical models of optimization problems - linear programming, netowrk analysis and integer programming. Formulation issues and basic solution methodologies are covered in a fairly rigorous fasion for these classes of optimizaiton problems. Examples are selected from a broad range of engineering and business problems. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4777/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.07", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rRecommendMajor": "3.66", "rCourseQuality": "2.93", "rWorkRequired": "2.52", "rInstructorAccess": "3.66", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.97", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/4777/sections/001", "id": "4777-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/4777/sections/001/reviews/2368-JOHN-YI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2368-JOHN-YI", "first_name": "JOHN", "last_name": "YI", "id": "2368-JOHN-YI", "name": "JOHN YI"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "4777-001-2368-JOHN-YI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SYS-304", "path": "/courses/4777", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4777/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/4777/sections/001", "id": "4777-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}]}, "id": 4777, "aliases": ["SYS-304"]}
