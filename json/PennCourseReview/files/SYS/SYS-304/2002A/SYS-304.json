{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1102"}, "description": "The course provides an introduction to optimization problems vis., the mathematical models, their formulation, analysis and computational tools for their solutions. The course covers major mathematical models of optimization problems - linear programming, netowrk analysis and integer programming. Formulation issues and basic solution methodologies are covered in a fairly rigorous fasion for these classes of optimizaiton problems. Examples are selected from a broad range of engineering and business problems. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1102/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.79", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "1.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "1.93", "rInstructorQuality": "1.82"}, "section": {"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/1102/sections/001", "id": "1102-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/1102/sections/001/reviews/1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR", "first_name": "SRISANKAR", "last_name": "KUNNIYUR", "id": "1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR", "name": "SRISANKAR KUNNIYUR"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "1102-001-1171-SRISANKAR-KUNNIYUR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SYS-304", "path": "/courses/1102", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1102/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-304-001", "path": "/courses/1102/sections/001", "id": "1102-001", "aliases": ["SYS-304-001"]}]}, "id": 1102, "aliases": ["SYS-304"]}
