{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2160"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to examine why and how to design a system. The emphasis is on the system approach, methodology and thinking. It begins not with the definition of what is to be designed but, rather with the purpose of the system to be designed. The design procedure will enable us to identify issues, construct alternatives and choose among alternatives to achieve the goal. The course will cover the following subjects: the systems approach, system logic, system values, assessment techniques (ranking methods, category methods, direct methods, gamble methods, and indifference methods), assessment models (scoring models and screening models), the utility assessment process, decision space, and multiattribute utility measurement. The outcome of the examination will be the selection of a first phase design. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SYS METHODOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3588/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "SYS METHODOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-590-001", "path": "/courses/3588/sections/001", "id": "3588-001", "aliases": ["SYS-590-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/3588/sections/001/reviews/1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "first_name": "IRAJ", "last_name": "ZANDI", "id": "1175-IRAJ-ZANDI", "name": "IRAJ ZANDI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "3588-001-1175-IRAJ-ZANDI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SYS-590", "path": "/courses/3588", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3588/sections", "values": [{"name": "SYS METHODOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SYS-590-001", "path": "/courses/3588/sections/001", "id": "3588-001", "aliases": ["SYS-590-001"]}]}, "id": 3588, "aliases": ["SYS-590"]}
