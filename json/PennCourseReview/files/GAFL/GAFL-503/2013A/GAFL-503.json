Whether you're writing for yourself or someone else, this course will provide the basics of speech writing and give you the opportunity to write, revise and deliver a variety of different speeches. You will also be given the opportunity to answer audience questions after your speeches. The emphasis will be on preparing and giving longer speeches where a prepared text or speaking notes would be advisable. In this performance course, you will examine and learn from great speeches--from the classics down to the present. Your speeches will be videotaped and you will receive feedback from both the instructor as well as your peers. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "Speech Writing", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30368/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.07", "rTAQuality": "3.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31"}, "section": {"name": "Speech Writing", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-503-001", "path": "/courses/30368/sections/001", "id": "30368-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-503-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30368/sections/001/reviews/3837-ARTHUR-C--BENEDICT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3837-ARTHUR-C--BENEDICT", "first_name": "ARTHUR C.", "last_name": "BENEDICT", "id": "3837-ARTHUR-C--BENEDICT", "name": "ARTHUR C.
