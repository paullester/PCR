The design of the course allows for a flexible workshop format and includes guest lectures by media personalities and politicians as well as a trip to meet with media professionals in Washington.  The course also provides regular opportunities for students to implement what they have learned through in-class media trainings, mock editorial board interviews, governing strategy scenarios, campaign strategy scenarios, and political advertisement assessments.\r\n\r\nOverall, the students had high regard for the course quality. It was described as a \u201cfantastic course\u201d and \u201call in all a wonderful experience.\u201d The students mentioned that there were lots of great guest speakers who contributed to the course. One student suggested to \u201cnot encourage students to take the mock press conferences lightly,\u201d as valuable speaking skills are learned through the experience.\r\n\r\nOverall, students stated that Professor Margolies \u201cwas spectacular\u201d and \u201camazing.\u201d but that she \u201ctries to jam too much into the class that it becomes overwhelming.\u201d In addition, one student mentioned that Professor Margolies \u201chas very little structure, which has its benefits but usually just confuses the students.\u201d \r\n\r\nFuture students should be aware that there are lots of supplemental readings to the course. One student commented that \u201cthe final project is very difficult and one of the most expensive projects I have had to do.\u201d Sometimes the homework assignments may not be very clear to the students, and the final project had \u201cvague guidelines.\u201d There are no prerequisites for this course.
