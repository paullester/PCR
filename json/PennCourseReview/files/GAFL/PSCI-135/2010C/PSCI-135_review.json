Students use the readings, their community service, and ongoing \"food events\" at Penn to analyze the politics of food in many arenas: from farms, kitchens, supermarkets, schools, and communities of faith to corporations, research institutions, the media and international trade.\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt this class was \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201camazing.\u201d Some felt that the three-hour seminar could be \u201cboring,\u201d and that time in class was not utilized effectively. Others thought that the community service aspect of the course unevenly burdened the students, as \u201cthe amount of time required on the part of the student varied dramatically\u201d between projects.\r\n\r\nStudents had uniformly positive reviews of Professor Summers, calling her \u201cextremely passionate,\u201d \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201cone of the most effective instructors I\u2019ve had at Penn.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students found the workload somewhat difficult to manage because they were expected to read \u201cabout one book a week,\u201d and complete \u201clots of little papers and assignments.\u201d Many, however, were quick to recommend this course to their peers, with one student calling it \u201cthe most rewarding class I\u2019ve taken so far.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 32, "path": "/courses/23663/sections/401/reviews/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "first_name": "MARY E", "last_name": "SUMMERS", "id": "990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "name": "MARY E SUMMERS"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "23663-401-990-MARY-E-SUMMERS"}]
