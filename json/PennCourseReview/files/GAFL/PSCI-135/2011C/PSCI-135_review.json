Students will use the readings, their community service, and ongoing \"food events\" at Penn to analyze the politics of food in many arenas: from farms, kitchens, supermarkets, schools, and communities of faith to corporations, research institutions, the media and international trade.\r\n\r\nA majority of students liked and were excited by this \u201cfascinating\u201d class, but were disappointed in the structure of the course. While they felt they learned \u201cquite a lot of thrilling knowledge,\u201d students almost exclusively thought this class was too large and would function better as a smaller seminar. The discussion-based aspect of the class would sometimes \u201cdetract\u201d from students\u2019 learning experience, since the class was so large. Furthermore, the class was deemed to have a lot of \u201cbusy work,\u201d requiring students to blog for the course. But many students still would recommend this course.\r\n\r\nProfessor Summers was described as \u201cwonderful, if a bit unorganized.\u201d Students loved the way she conveyed information \u201cclearly\u201d and said she was \u201cdefinitely knowledgeable about the subject.\u201d She did a great job of \u201cintegrating many different views into the course,\u201d but students wished she had structured the class differently so that she was teaching more, rather than relying on peer-led discussions.\r\n\r\nStudents were frustrated with having to blog and the disorganized Blackboard site of this class, but overall, they generally enjoyed the course and would recommend it to everyone. This class requires a service project, which students liked, but wish it composed a smaller part of the course.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/25002/sections/401/reviews/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "first_name": "MARY E", "last_name": "SUMMERS", "id": "990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "name": "MARY E SUMMERS"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "25002-401-990-MARY-E-SUMMERS"}]
