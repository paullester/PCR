{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3096"}, "description": "Mayor John Street has appointed a special task force, co-chaired by Penn Professor Harvey Rubin and Philadelphia Managing Director Pedro Ramos, to examine the city's preparedness plans. The task force's mission includes examining the city's evacuation procedures, as well as the strategy for ensuring continuity of its government and businesses. The goal: to assess how well the city is prepared for catastrophic threats, both natural and deliberate, and to help the city build the teamwork required to deal with whatever might occur. Students enrolled in this course will explore the issues and work directly with Dr. Rubin to help develop the task force's report, which will be presented to the mayor in June 2006. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "HOMELAND SECURITY PHILA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7783/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "1.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "1.87", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "HOMELAND SECURITY PHILA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-475-001", "path": "/courses/7783/sections/001", "id": "7783-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-475-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/7783/sections/001/reviews/2984-HARVEY-RUBIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2984-HARVEY-RUBIN", "first_name": "HARVEY", "last_name": "RUBIN", "id": "2984-HARVEY-RUBIN", "name": "HARVEY RUBIN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "7783-001-2984-HARVEY-RUBIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GAFL-475", "path": "/courses/7783", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7783/sections", "values": [{"name": "HOMELAND SECURITY PHILA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-475-001", "path": "/courses/7783/sections/001", "id": "7783-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-475-001"]}]}, "id": 7783, "aliases": ["GAFL-475"]}
