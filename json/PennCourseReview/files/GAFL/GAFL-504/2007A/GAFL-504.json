{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1863"}, "description": "This course prepares students of staff positions with US Senators and Representatives. It will examine the life of a member of the United States Senate or House of Representatives from one election to the next, following that elected official's career as he or she is sworn in, hires a staff, drafts legislation, listens to constituent needs, and, ultimately, runs for Congress again. The course will also draw upon weekly developments in ongoing congressional races to enrich the discussions. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "ELECTED OFFICE: CONGRESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14544/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ELECTED OFFICE: CONGRESS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-504-001", "path": "/courses/14544/sections/001", "id": "14544-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-504-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/14544/sections/001/reviews/4177-VINCENT-A-GALKO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4177-VINCENT-A-GALKO", "first_name": "VINCENT A", "last_name": "GALKO", "id": "4177-VINCENT-A-GALKO", "name": "VINCENT A GALKO"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "14544-001-4177-VINCENT-A-GALKO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GAFL-504", "path": "/courses/14544", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14544/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELECTED OFFICE: CONGRESS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-504-001", "path": "/courses/14544/sections/001", "id": "14544-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-504-001"]}]}, "id": 14544, "aliases": ["GAFL-504"]}
