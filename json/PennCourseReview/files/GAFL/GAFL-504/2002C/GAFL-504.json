{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1863"}, "description": "This course prepares students of staff positions with US Senators and Representatives. It will examine the life of a member of the United States Senate or House of Representatives from one election to the next, following that elected official's career as he or she is sworn in, hires a staff, drafts legislation, listens to constituent needs, and, ultimately, runs for Congress again. The course will also draw upon weekly developments in ongoing congressional races to enrich the discussions. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "Holding Elected Office:  A Congressional Perspective", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3017/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.57", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "Holding Elected Office:  A Congressional Perspective", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-504-001", "path": "/courses/3017/sections/001", "id": "3017-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-504-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/3017/sections/001/reviews/1466-REBECCA-M-KIRSZNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1466-REBECCA-M-KIRSZNER", "first_name": "REBECCA M", "last_name": "KIRSZNER", "id": "1466-REBECCA-M-KIRSZNER", "name": "REBECCA M KIRSZNER"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "3017-001-1466-REBECCA-M-KIRSZNER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GAFL-504", "path": "/courses/3017", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3017/sections", "values": [{"name": "Holding Elected Office:  A Congressional Perspective", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-504-001", "path": "/courses/3017/sections/001", "id": "3017-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-504-001"]}]}, "id": 3017, "aliases": ["GAFL-504"]}
