{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/517"}, "description": "This class explores how city administrators and legislatures have addressed the critical issues facing urban America today, including fighting urban blight and transforming neighborhoods, public school funding, public financing of sports stadiums, reducing the tax burden, public health issues like smoking bans, legislative redistricting, crime and safety issues, campaign finance finance reform, economic development issues like tax increment financing, race relations, welfare reform, public transportation, and how to reverse job and population losses. The goal is to place in context the various ways that elected officials approach complex issues, towards a more realistic understanding of how to influence a proposal as it works its way through the process towards implementation. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "BIG CITY POLITICS: How to Pass Municipal Legislation", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10469/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "1.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.59", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "3.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "3.45", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "BIG CITY POLITICS: How to Pass Municipal Legislation", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-532-001", "path": "/courses/10469/sections/001", "id": "10469-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-532-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/10469/sections/001/reviews/561-JAMES-F-KENNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/561-JAMES-F-KENNEY", "first_name": "JAMES F", "last_name": "KENNEY", "id": "561-JAMES-F-KENNEY", "name": "JAMES F KENNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "10469-001-561-JAMES-F-KENNEY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "1.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.55", "rWorkRequired": "1.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.64", "rCommAbility": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "BIG CITY POLITICS: How to Pass Municipal Legislation", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-532-001", "path": "/courses/10469/sections/001", "id": "10469-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-532-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/10469/sections/001/reviews/2770-JOHN-C-HAWKINS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2770-JOHN-C-HAWKINS", "first_name": "JOHN C", "last_name": "HAWKINS", "id": "2770-JOHN-C-HAWKINS", "name": "JOHN C HAWKINS"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "10469-001-2770-JOHN-C-HAWKINS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GAFL-532", "path": "/courses/10469", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10469/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIG CITY POLITICS: How to Pass Municipal Legislation", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "GAFL-532-001", "path": "/courses/10469/sections/001", "id": "10469-001", "aliases": ["GAFL-532-001"]}]}, "id": 10469, "aliases": ["GAFL-532"]}
