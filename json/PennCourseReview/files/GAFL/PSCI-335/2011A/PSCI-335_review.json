Course readings include texts by Jonathan Kozol, studies of health inequalities and their causes, and studies of No Child Left Behind, the CDC\u2019s School Health Index, recess, school meal, and nutrition education programs. Course speakers help students examine the history, theories, politics and leadership behind different strategies for addressing school-based inequalities and their outcomes. Service options focus especially on the West Philadelphia Recess Initiative. Other service options include work with Community School Student Partnerships and the Urban Nutrition Initiative. Students write several short papers based on course readings and present group reports and case studies based on the service projects. (A research paper is optional.)&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students generally enjoyed this course, and one student called it \u201cone of my favorite classes at Penn.\u201d The service placement was the \u201ccentral component\u201d of the course, which one student described as \u201ctruly hands-on learning.\u201d The focus certainly seemed to be on students\u2019 placements, and one student commented that sometimes class discussion dwelt too much \u201con anecdotes from service placements\u201d that didn\u2019t necessarily contribute substantially to their understanding of greater issues in education. A couple of students found the class \u201ca little too large for a seminar\u201d and thought the course would have functioned better with fewer students.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students described Professor Summers very positively, describing her as \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cincredibly sweet,\u201d and \u201ctruly passionate\u201d about improving urban schools. Students also found Professor Summers to be extremely \u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cunderstanding\u201d when it came to making adjustments to assignments and coursework. Professor Summers was genuinely interested in hearing about students\u2019 experiences with their placements and was dedicated to helping students do well on their projects. A few students mentioned that a little more organization and direction of class discussions would have been beneficial.&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;Students described this ABCS course as a good course for students interested in service learning, urban environments, schools, and politics. One student noted that it was a \u201cgreat introduction to a service learning class.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;**Class only reviewed by 6 students", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/22335/sections/401/reviews/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "first_name": "MARY E", "last_name": "SUMMERS", "id": "990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "name": "MARY E SUMMERS"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "22335-401-990-MARY-E-SUMMERS"}]
