{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3925"}, "description": "This Fox Leadership and academically based community service seminar will use course readings and students' own observations and interviews in their service learning projects in West Philadelphia schools to analyze the causes and impact of school health and educational inequalities and efforts to address them. Course readings will include works by Jonathan Kozol, studies of health inequalities and their causes, and studies of No Child Left Behind, the CDC's School Health Index, recess, school meal, and nutrition education programs. Course speakers will help us examine the history, theories, politics and leadership behind different strategies for addressing school-based inequalities and their outcomes. Service options will focus especially on the West Philadelphia Recess Initiative. Other service options will include work with Community School Student Partnerships and the Urban Nutrition Initiative. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HEALTHY SCHOOLS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26672/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "1.92", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.58", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTHY SCHOOLS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-335-401", "path": "/courses/26672/sections/401", "id": "26672-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-335-401", "HSOC-335-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/26672/sections/401/reviews/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "first_name": "MARY E", "last_name": "SUMMERS", "id": "990-MARY-E-SUMMERS", "name": "MARY E SUMMERS"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "26672-401-990-MARY-E-SUMMERS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-335", "path": "/courses/26672", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26672/sections", "values": [{"name": "HEALTHY SCHOOLS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-335-401", "path": "/courses/26672/sections/401", "id": "26672-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-335-401", "HSOC-335-401"]}]}, "id": 26672, "aliases": ["PSCI-335", "HSOC-335"]}
