{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2505"}, "description": "Using the approaches of such computer scientists as Donald A Norman (The Design of Everyday Things) and Alan Cooper, the father of Visual Basic, this writing seminar will explore issues and ideas related to the creative process and end results of how everyday objects are designed and used, from light switches and telephones to computer software. This seminar is intended for anyone who is interested in thinking about everyday life and its objects and learning about what goes into the design process. We will explore design failures and successes, and learn how attention to the objects in our everday lives and how these were designed changes our perspective toward not only the objects that surround us, but our very lives and culture. Along with readings from Norman and Cooper, readings will also likely be drawn from journals, magazines, newspapers. Students will be expected to write and revise 3 four-to-six page papers, one-page responses, in-class writings and a reading and idea journal. \n\nThis is a writing seminar--and as such fulfills the entire Writing Requirement for students in all four undergraduate schools. The seminar contents vary from semester to semester; for a current description, please see the Writing Program web site: www.english.upenn.edu/Writing. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "WRITING ABOUT SCI & ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10239/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.54", "rDifficulty": "1.46", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "2.62", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.08", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "2.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.46", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.23"}, "section": {"name": "WRITING ABOUT SCI & ENG", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "EAS-009-301", "path": "/courses/10239/sections/301", "id": "10239-301", "aliases": ["EAS-009-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/10239/sections/301/reviews/2436-TAMAR-E-GRANOR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2436-TAMAR-E-GRANOR", "first_name": "TAMAR E", "last_name": "GRANOR", "id": "2436-TAMAR-E-GRANOR", "name": "TAMAR E GRANOR"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "10239-301-2436-TAMAR-E-GRANOR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-009", "path": "/courses/10239", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10239/sections", "values": [{"name": "WRITING ABOUT SCI & ENG", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "EAS-009-301", "path": "/courses/10239/sections/301", "id": "10239-301", "aliases": ["EAS-009-301"]}]}, "id": 10239, "aliases": ["EAS-009"]}
