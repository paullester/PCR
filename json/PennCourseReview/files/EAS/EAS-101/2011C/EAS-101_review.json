It\r\nexposes students to the engineering disciplines through hands-on laboratory experiences.\r\nIn addition, the course provides tutorials on how to use important software packages as\r\nwell as a \"Professional Preparation\" module through studies of communication (writing\r\nand speaking skills), ethics, leadership, and teamwork.\r\nThis course is a \u201cgood overview\u201d for all the different engineering majors.\r\nHowever, it only offers a tiny glimpse into each department. Students enjoyed the\r\nTuesday night lectures, where the professor would have different engineering professors\r\ncome in and talk about their department over pizza.\r\nStudents had no complaints about Professor Pope, although they did wish that the\r\nTAs graded the labs less strictly. Pope was seen as \u201cfantastic,\u201d with his lectures being the\r\nstudents\u2019 favorite part of this course.\r\nThe lab portion of this course was time-intensive and required skill in writing lab\r\nreports. The labs only offered a small insight into each field, and students recommended\r\nremoving the lab portion from this class and turning it into a lecture series. The course is\r\nideal for freshman interested in studying engineering.", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/24249/sections/002/reviews/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "first_name": "DAVID P", "last_name": "POPE", "id": "835-DAVID-P-POPE", "name": "DAVID P POPE"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "24249-002-835-DAVID-P-POPE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.44", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.44", "rRecommendMajor": "2.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.30", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "2.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "EAS-101-003", "path": "/courses/24249/sections/003", "id": "24249-003", "aliases": ["EAS-101-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/24249/sections/003/reviews/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/835-DAVID-P-POPE", "first_name": "DAVID P", "last_name": "POPE", "id": "835-DAVID-P-POPE", "name": "DAVID P POPE"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "24249-003-835-DAVID-P-POPE"}]
