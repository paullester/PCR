{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1786"}, "description": "This course is intended to introduce students to the field of engineering. It will expose students to the engineering disciplines through hands-on laboratory experiences. In addition, the course will provide tutorials on how to use important software packages as well as a \"Professional Preparation\" module through studies of communication (writing and speaking skills), ethics, leadership and teamwork. This course is ideal for any freshman interested in exploring the possibility of studying engineering at Penn. The course counts as as a engineering requirement in SEAS. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "INTRO TO ENGINEERING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22905/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ENGINEERING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-101-001", "path": "/courses/22905/sections/001", "id": "22905-001", "aliases": ["EAS-101-001"]}, "comments": "This course is intended to introduce students to the field of engineering.
