{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5533"}, "description": "The practice of engineering requires more than creativity, diligence, and technical knowledge: it demands the tools to manage the conflicting needs of clients, managers, and the public; an ability to act responsibly when problems arise; and, above all, strong communication skills. This course will examine the major ethical issues associated with engineering practice while enhancing students' technical writing. Through the study of important case studies like the Great Molasses Flood, the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we will learn about the responsibilities of engineering professionals, as well as the causes and consequences of technological failure. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "ENGINEERING ETHICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28786/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rTAQuality": "3.61", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.68", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "2.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.95"}, "section": {"name": "ENGINEERING ETHICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-203-001", "path": "/courses/28786/sections/001", "id": "28786-001", "aliases": ["EAS-203-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/28786/sections/001/reviews/4581-MATTHEW-H--HERSCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4581-MATTHEW-H--HERSCH", "first_name": "MATTHEW H.", "last_name": "HERSCH", "id": "4581-MATTHEW-H--HERSCH", "name": "MATTHEW H.
