{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5108"}, "description": "This is a Master's level course that seeks to teach the physics needed to begin a study of engineering and science at the nanometer scale. Since the nanometer scale is so close to the quantum scale, much of the course deals with an introduction to quantum mechanics but the course also includes discussions in solid-state physics, electricity and magnetism and mechanics. The objective of the course is to teach the physics that an engineering student would need to have in order to do experimental work at the nanometer scale. In addition, this course will prepare the student to take more advanced courses in the Nanotechnology Program. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "FUND CONCEPTS IN NANOTEC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22913/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "FUND CONCEPTS IN NANOTEC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-504-001", "path": "/courses/22913/sections/001", "id": "22913-001", "aliases": ["EAS-504-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/22913/sections/001/reviews/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "CARCHIDI", "id": "774-MICHAEL-A--CARCHIDI", "name": "MICHAEL A.
