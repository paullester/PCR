The class teaches students accepted to the program about orthotics and developmental disorders. It prepares students for a 17-day trip to rural China and Hong Kong during the summer where they build orthotic devices for children. \r\n\r\nStudents enjoyed the course immensely, claiming it to be the best they have ever taken in Penn. \u201cEvery BE major should know about this opportunity,\u201d said one student, \u201cand take advantage of it.\u201d \u201cFrom Cantonese to orthotics, this project covered everything,\u201d said another. The only downside of this course was lack of structure in terms of due dates. \r\n\r\nProfessor Bogen was a great instructor. He effectively communicated the material, inspired interest in the students, and was accessible and willing to discuss course content and students\u2019 problems. \r\n\r\nThe course was considered to be moderately difficult, requiring a reasonable amount of work. The students learned a great deal from it in terms of knowledge, concepts, skills, and thinking ability. They agreed that it is a \u201cfantastic course\u201d and it was highly recommended to both majors and non-majors. \r\n", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/17200/sections/002/reviews/162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN", "first_name": "DANIEL KENT", "last_name": "BOGEN", "id": "162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN", "name": "DANIEL KENT BOGEN"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "17200-002-162-DANIEL-KENT-BOGEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-297", "path": "/courses/17200", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17200/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLIN ORTHO FIELD WORK", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "EAS-297-002", "path": "/courses/17200/sections/002", "id": "17200-002", "aliases": ["EAS-297-002"]}]}, "id": 17200, "aliases": ["EAS-297"]}
