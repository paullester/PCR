{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3051"}, "description": "This course is the sequel to EAS 445 and focuses on the planning process for a new technology venture. Like its prerequisite, the course is designed expressly for students of engineering and applied science having a keen interest in technological innovation. Whereas EAS 445 investigates the sequential stages of engineering entrepreneurship from the initial idea through the early growth phase of a startup company, EAS 446 provides hands-on experience in developing a business plan for such a venture. Working in teams, students prepare and present a comprehensive business plan for a high-tech opportunity. The course expands on topics from EAS 445 with more in-depth attention to: industry and marketplace analysis; competitive strategies related to high-tech product/service positioning, marketing, development and operations; and preparation of sound financial plans. Effective written and verbal presentation skills are emphasized throughout the course. Ultimately, each team presents its plan to a distinguished panel of recognized enterepreneurs, investors and advisors from the high-tech industry. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ENG ENTREPRENEURSHIP II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18522/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.68", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.89", "rCourseQuality": "3.84", "rWorkRequired": "3.74", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.53", "rCommAbility": "3.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.68"}, "section": {"name": "ENG ENTREPRENEURSHIP II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-446-401", "path": "/courses/18522/sections/401", "id": "18522-401", "aliases": ["EAS-446-401", "EAS-546-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/18522/sections/401/reviews/1595-JEFFREY-A--BABIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1595-JEFFREY-A--BABIN", "first_name": "JEFFREY A.", "last_name": "BABIN", "id": "1595-JEFFREY-A--BABIN", "name": "JEFFREY A.
