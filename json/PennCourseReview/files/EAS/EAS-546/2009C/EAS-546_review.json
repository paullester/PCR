Like its prerequisite, the course is designed expressly for students of engineering and applied science that have a keen interest in technological innovation. Working in teams, students prepare and present a comprehensive business plan for a high-tech opportunity. Ultimately, each team presents its plan to a panel of distinguished entrepreneurs, investors and advisors from the high-tech industry. \r\n\r\nNothing but great praise was given for this course. Many students echoed that it was \u201cone of the best, most interesting, and most valuable courses I have ever taken.\u201d Students felt they gained plenty of knowledge and insight, one stating that the class \u201cis much more than a stepping stone for entrepreneurship.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents also found Professor Cassel to be a fantastic teacher. One student claimed that \u201cif you haven\u2019t taken a course with Dr. Cassel while at Penn engineering, then you have wasted your time!\u201d Professor Cassel was found to be engaging in class, with his \u201cexperience and grilling [students] really making participants think.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents stated that the course required plenty of work and a strong team, but find the work \u201cvery rewarding.\u201d The course is open to those of Junior or higher standing. \r\n", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/17204/sections/002/reviews/317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "first_name": "THOMAS A.", "last_name": "CASSEL", "id": "317-THOMAS-A--CASSEL", "name": "THOMAS A.
