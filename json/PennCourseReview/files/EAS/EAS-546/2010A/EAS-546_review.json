Like its prerequisite, the course is designed expressly for students of engineering and applied science having a keen interest in technological innovation. Whereas EAS 545 investigates the sequential stages of engineering entrepreneurship from the initial idea through the early growth phase of a startup company, EAS 546 provides hands-on experience in developing a business plan for such a venture. Working in teams, students prepare and present a comprehensive business plan for a high-tech opportunity. The course expands on topics from EAS 545 with more in-depth attention to: industry and marketplace analysis; competitive strategies related to high-tech product/service positioning, marketing, development and operations; and preparation of sound financial plans. Effective written and verbal presentation skills are emphasized throughout the course. Ultimately, each team presents its plan to a distinguished panel of recognized entrepreneurs, investors and advisors from the high-tech industry.\r\n\r\nStudents extremely enjoyed the material of the course, with one that would \u201chighly recommend this course to every Penn Engineer at least\u201d.\r\n\r\nStudents thought that Professor Cassel instructed very well. One student even though that he \u201cinspires confidence in his students.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents found the course to have a lot of work. Some wished that some of the deliverables and quizzes could be removed for more time to hear from Professor Cassel. The prerequisite for this course is EAS 545.
