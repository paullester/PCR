{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2507"}, "description": "Not every idea leads to a great product. The process of \"crystallizing\" a clever idea into a saleable asset demands a mix of creativity, systems thinking, sound business instincts, and the courage to do things differently. Students in this project-centered course will gain the necessary skills and experience from concentrated work on early-stage inventions drawn from Penn's technology portfolio. Is the invention feasible? Patentable? How should it be designed and produced? What will it cost? Is there a market? Does the payoff justify the investment? These and similar questions will be answered through a multifaceted process including analysis, experimentation, design, and/or market research. The projects are not \"case studies\", but rather involve real, current intellectual property of potential value to the University. Inventors and specialists from the Center for Technology Transfer will be available to collaborate with the student teams. Project work will be complemented by lectures and exercises dealing with the patent process, cost and market estimation, project planning, economic analysis, and the systems approach to new product design. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "IDEAS TO ASSETS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10246/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.25", "rDifficulty": "1.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.13", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "1.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "2.13"}, "section": {"name": "IDEAS TO ASSETS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-349-001", "path": "/courses/10246/sections/001", "id": "10246-001", "aliases": ["EAS-349-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/10246/sections/001/reviews/2438-ROBERT-L--JEFFCOAT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2438-ROBERT-L--JEFFCOAT", "first_name": "ROBERT L.", "last_name": "JEFFCOAT", "id": "2438-ROBERT-L--JEFFCOAT", "name": "ROBERT L.
