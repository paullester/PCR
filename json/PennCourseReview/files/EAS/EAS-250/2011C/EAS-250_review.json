The course covers how that energy is\r\nsupplied, the anticipated global growth in energy demand, the resources availability and\r\nthe role of science and technology in meeting that demand in a world concerned about\r\nclimate change. The roles of conservation, improved efficiency and renewable energy in\r\nmeeting future demand in a sustainable, environmentally benign way are covered.\r\nStudents found this class to be an \u201cexcellent overview\u201d of energy systems. Quite a\r\nfew students felt that the quizzes were too \u201cdetail oriented\u201d and the answers too rigid.\r\nThey suggested that the quizzes should focus on broader concepts instead.\r\nOverall, students enjoyed Professor Jackson\u2019s choice of topics and assignments.\r\nHowever, they wished that the professor could provide more feedback on the\r\nassignments.\r\nStudents did not find this course too difficult, but still thought that it required a\r\n\u201cconsiderable amount of work.\u201d This class is recommended to anyone interested in\r\nenergy.\r\nFewer than eight student comments were submitted for this course.", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/24251/sections/001/reviews/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "name": "ANDREW JACKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "24251-001-5231-ANDREW-JACKSON"}]
