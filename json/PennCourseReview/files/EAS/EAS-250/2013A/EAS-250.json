{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5208"}, "description": "The course will present a comprehensive overview of the global demand for energy, and the resource availability and technology used in its current and future supply. Through a personal energy audit, students will be made aware of the extensive role that energy plays in modern life, both directly, through electricity and transportation fuel, and indirectly in the manufacturing of goods they use. The course will cover how that energy is supplied, the anticipated global growth in energy demand, the resource availability and the role of science and technology in meeting that demand in a world concerned about climate change. The roles of conservation, improved efficiency and renewable energy in meeting future demand in a sustainable, environmentally benign way will be covered. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ENERGY SYS, RES & TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30142/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.56", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rTAQuality": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "ENERGY SYS, RES & TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-250-001", "path": "/courses/30142/sections/001", "id": "30142-001", "aliases": ["EAS-250-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30142/sections/001/reviews/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "5231-ANDREW-JACKSON", "name": "ANDREW JACKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "30142-001-5231-ANDREW-JACKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-250", "path": "/courses/30142", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30142/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENERGY SYS, RES & TECH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-250-001", "path": "/courses/30142/sections/001", "id": "30142-001", "aliases": ["EAS-250-001"]}]}, "id": 30142, "aliases": ["EAS-250"]}
