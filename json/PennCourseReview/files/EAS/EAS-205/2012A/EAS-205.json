{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4226"}, "description": "This course will discuss a number of canonical problems and show how numerical methods are used to solve them. Lectures will introduce the underlying theory and the relevant numerical methods. Students will be expected to implement solutions to the problems using MATLAB. The course will use the visualization capabilities of MATLAB to provide students with a geometric interpretation of the key ideas underlying the numerical methods. Topics to be covered will include: The solution of systems of linear systems equations with application to problems such as force balance analysis and global illumination computation. Representing and computing coordinate transformations with applications to problems in graphics, vision and robotics. Transform Coding with applications to the analysis of audio signals and image compression. Analysis of variance and the search for low dimensional representations for high dimensional data sets egs. Google's PageRank algorithm. Least Squares model fitting with applications to data analysis. Analysis of linear dynamical systems with applications to understanding the modes of vibration of mechanical systems. The analysis of stochastic systems governed by state transition matrices. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "APP OF SCIENTIFIC COMP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27244/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "APP OF SCIENTIFIC COMP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-205-001", "path": "/courses/27244/sections/001", "id": "27244-001", "aliases": ["EAS-205-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/27244/sections/001/reviews/248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "first_name": "JEAN HENRI", "last_name": "GALLIER", "id": "248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER", "name": "JEAN HENRI GALLIER"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "27244-001-248-JEAN-HENRI-GALLIER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-205", "path": "/courses/27244", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27244/sections", "values": [{"name": "APP OF SCIENTIFIC COMP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EAS-205-001", "path": "/courses/27244/sections/001", "id": "27244-001", "aliases": ["EAS-205-001"]}]}, "id": 27244, "aliases": ["EAS-205"]}
