{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4228"}, "description": "A product is any artifact, service or experience for which a buyer is willing to pay. Product Design & Development is at the core of entrepreneurship. Though in modern mythology it is a solitary effort by a passionate individual, entrepreneurship is frequently more successful when pursued in an interdisciplinary environment. Though it rarely requires the greatest time investment, concentration of personnel, the majority of the funding or even the greatest depth of expertise to accomplish, excellent product design can be the difference between a successful and failed venture. A poorly designed \"product \"can prevent a venture from being successful. An excellently designed product can make a competent business plan much more successful. A well defined and designed product solution will create differentiation, and can not only meet customer expectation but can create desirability. Through the review and discussion of case studies, lecture subjects, guest lecturers, field trips, and a semester long interdisciplinary team project, this class will provide insight into the problem identification and product design processes, user needs research, intellectual property research, experience design, Industrial Design, Interface Design, brand development and product centric fundraising processes. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "PROD DEV/ENTREP VENTURES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27250/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.24", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rRecommendMajor": "2.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.41", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "1.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.12", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.53"}, "section": {"name": "PROD DEV/ENTREP VENTURES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-449-401", "path": "/courses/27250/sections/401", "id": "27250-401", "aliases": ["EAS-449-401", "IPD-549-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/27250/sections/401/reviews/3366-PETER-W--BRESSLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3366-PETER-W--BRESSLER", "first_name": "PETER W.", "last_name": "BRESSLER", "id": "3366-PETER-W--BRESSLER", "name": "PETER W.
