{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1785"}, "description": "The increasing scale, complexity, and social impact of technology have forced the engineering community to re-examine issues of professional ethics and responsibility. In these seminars students will participate in discussions oriented around a series of real-world case studies involving a wide range of contemporary controversies, including the Challenger disaster, software liability, and intellectual property issues. The goal is to provide students with tools for thinking about the complex ethical issues that they were likely to encounter in their own academic and professional careers. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "ENGINEERING ETHICS SEM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3965/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.33", "rDifficulty": "0.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "0.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "ENGINEERING ETHICS SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "EAS-001-301", "path": "/courses/3965/sections/301", "id": "3965-301", "aliases": ["EAS-001-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/3965/sections/301/reviews/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "first_name": "NATHAN", "last_name": "ENSMENGER", "id": "664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER", "name": "NATHAN ENSMENGER"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "3965-301-664-NATHAN-ENSMENGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-001", "path": "/courses/3965", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3965/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENGINEERING ETHICS SEM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "EAS-001-301", "path": "/courses/3965/sections/301", "id": "3965-301", "aliases": ["EAS-001-301"]}]}, "id": 3965, "aliases": ["EAS-001"]}
