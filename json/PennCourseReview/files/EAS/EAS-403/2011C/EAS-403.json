{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4938"}, "description": "This is a survey course that will examine the current U.S. energy industry, from production to consumption, and its impacts on local, regional, and the global environment. The course will seek to provide a fuller understanding of existing energy systems, ranging from technical overviews of each, a review of industry organization, and an exploration of the well-established policy framework each operates within. Near-term demands upon each energy supply system will be discussed, with particular focus on environmental constraints. Policy options facing each energy industry will be reviewed. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ENERGY SYSTEMS & POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24255/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "2.48", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.23", "rCourseQuality": "3.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.68", "rReadingsValue": "3.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.68", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.26"}, "section": {"name": "ENERGY SYSTEMS & POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-403-401", "path": "/courses/24255/sections/401", "id": "24255-401", "aliases": ["EAS-403-401", "EAS-503-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/24255/sections/401/reviews/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "HUEMMLER", "id": "4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "name": "ANDREW HUEMMLER"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "24255-401-4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-403", "path": "/courses/24255", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24255/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENERGY SYSTEMS & POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-403-401", "path": "/courses/24255/sections/401", "id": "24255-401", "aliases": ["EAS-403-401", "EAS-503-401"]}]}, "id": 24255, "aliases": ["EAS-403", "EAS-503"]}
