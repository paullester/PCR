Examples are\r\ndrawn from the simulation of physical and chemical systems, the analysis of\r\nexperimental data, Monte Carlo numerical experiments, image and audio processing, and\r\ncontrol of sensors and actuators.\r\nOverall, students thought that this course was a good introductory programming\r\ncourse. However, for those with no prior programming experience, little extra help is\r\noffered. Students were thrown blindly into the first few projects, and oftentimes those\r\nwith prior programming knowledge benefitted much more than those who had never been\r\nexposed to it before.\r\nProfessor Dietz was seen as a good teacher, but some students wished that she did\r\na little more teaching in regards to the programming she expected her students to\r\ncomplete. Dietz believes that \u201ceveryone is smart\u201d and thus \u201ccapable of tackling the\r\nchallenges of programming and debugging,\u201d but those with little prior experience had\r\ndifficulty following her teaching style.\r\nStudents appreciated the depth of knowledge they gained about MATLAB. The\r\nprojects for homework were apt, and many felt the tests were slightly biased toward those\r\nwho could write code faster.
