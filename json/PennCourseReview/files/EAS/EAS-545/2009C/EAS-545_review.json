The course investigates the roles of inventors and founders in successful technology ventures while also studying key areas such as intellectual property, opportunity analysis and concept testing, construction of defensible competitive strategies, acquisition of resources, and founder\u2019s leadership role in an emerging high-tech company. Emphasis is placed on decisions faced by founders and on the sequential risks and determinants of success in the early growth phase of technology venture. \r\n\r\nThe course provides an excellent introduction to both entrepreneurship and business and is designed for engineering students with prior business education. Students were \u201ctaught a huge quantity and breadth of knowledge\u201d that \u201cwould be really useful to any engineer with ambition.\u201d Although an EAS course, the material bridges science and technology to the practical realities of the business world. \r\n\r\nGenerally, students praised Professor Babin, describing his lectures as \u201cstimulating,\u201d \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cinteractive.\u201d One student even stated \u201cProfessor Babin was one of the best lecturers I\u2019ve had.\u201d Students commented Professor Babin cared about his students and was always willing to help, but one student pointed out he was impossible to reach via email. \r\n\r\nOverall, students found the course stimulating though work intensive. While the readings were \u201camazing,\u201d some reported the weekly quizzes and papers became burdens and unnecessary ways to force students to do the readings. Class participation was a large portion of the grade, resulting in many students asking irrelevant questions and delaying class time. This course is open to those of junior or higher standing. \r\n", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/17203/sections/001/reviews/1595-JEFFREY-A--BABIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1595-JEFFREY-A--BABIN", "first_name": "JEFFREY A.", "last_name": "BABIN", "id": "1595-JEFFREY-A--BABIN", "name": "JEFFREY A.
