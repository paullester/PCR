{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5107"}, "description": "The course will exam Pacala and Socolow's hypothesis that \"Humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical and industrial know-how t solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century.\" Fifteen \"climate stabilization wedges\" i.e., strategies that each have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 1 billion ons per year by 2054, will be examined in detail. Technology and economics will be reviewed. Socio-political barriers to mass-scale implementation will be discussed. Pacala and Socolow note \"Every element in this portfoloio has passed beyond the laboratory bench and demonstration project; many are already implemented somewhere at full industrial scale\". \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28791/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.10", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-301-401", "path": "/courses/28791/sections/401", "id": "28791-401", "aliases": ["EAS-301-401", "EAS-505-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/28791/sections/401/reviews/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "HUEMMLER", "id": "4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "name": "ANDREW HUEMMLER"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "28791-401-4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-301", "path": "/courses/28791", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28791/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-301-401", "path": "/courses/28791/sections/401", "id": "28791-401", "aliases": ["EAS-301-401", "EAS-505-401"]}]}, "id": 28791, "aliases": ["EAS-301", "EAS-505"]}
