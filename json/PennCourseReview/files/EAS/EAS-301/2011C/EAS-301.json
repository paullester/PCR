{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5107"}, "description": "The course will exam Pacala and Socolow's hypothesis that \"Humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical and industrial know-how t solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century.\" Fifteen \"climate stabilization wedges\" i.e., strategies that each have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 1 billion ons per year by 2054, will be examined in detail. Technology and economics will be reviewed. Socio-political barriers to mass-scale implementation will be discussed. Pacala and Socolow note \"Every element in this portfoloio has passed beyond the laboratory bench and demonstration project; many are already implemented somewhere at full industrial scale\". \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24253/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "2.31", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.23", "rCommAbility": "3.23", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-301-401", "path": "/courses/24253/sections/401", "id": "24253-401", "aliases": ["EAS-301-401", "EAS-505-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/24253/sections/401/reviews/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "HUEMMLER", "id": "4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "name": "ANDREW HUEMMLER"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "24253-401-4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-301", "path": "/courses/24253", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24253/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-301-401", "path": "/courses/24253/sections/401", "id": "24253-401", "aliases": ["EAS-301-401", "EAS-505-401"]}]}, "id": 24253, "aliases": ["EAS-301", "EAS-505"]}
