{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5107"}, "description": "The course will exam Pacala and Socolow's hypothesis that \"Humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical and industrial know-how t solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century.\" Fifteen \"climate stabilization wedges\" i.e., strategies that each have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 1 billion ons per year by 2054, will be examined in detail. Technology and economics will be reviewed. Socio-political barriers to mass-scale implementation will be discussed. Pacala and Socolow note \"Every element in this portfoloio has passed beyond the laboratory bench and demonstration project; many are already implemented somewhere at full industrial scale\". \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22909/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.88", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-301-401", "path": "/courses/22909/sections/401", "id": "22909-401", "aliases": ["EAS-301-401", "EAS-505-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/22909/sections/401/reviews/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "HUEMMLER", "id": "4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER", "name": "ANDREW HUEMMLER"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "22909-401-4799-ANDREW-HUEMMLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EAS-301", "path": "/courses/22909", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22909/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLIMATE POLICY & TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EAS-301-401", "path": "/courses/22909/sections/401", "id": "22909-401", "aliases": ["EAS-301-401", "EAS-505-401"]}]}, "id": 22909, "aliases": ["EAS-301", "EAS-505"]}
