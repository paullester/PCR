{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1865"}, "description": "Judges in law courts are bound to decide facts according to law and to find law in keeping with precedent, statutes, and the Constitution. How do judges shoulder this great responsibility when the cases before them involve highly politicized, morally charged, socially divisive issues about which the judge may have formed a strong personal opinion? The course will address this question through a reading of cases and commentary, including in particular Robert Cover's Justice Accused and Lawrence Baum's The Puzzle of Judicial Behavior. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "JUDGES AND JUDGING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3023/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "JUDGES AND JUDGING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GENH-219-301", "path": "/courses/3023/sections/301", "id": "3023-301", "aliases": ["GENH-219-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/3023/sections/301/reviews/1469-GORDON-BERMANT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1469-GORDON-BERMANT", "first_name": "GORDON", "last_name": "BERMANT", "id": "1469-GORDON-BERMANT", "name": "GORDON BERMANT"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "3023-301-1469-GORDON-BERMANT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GENH-219", "path": "/courses/3023", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3023/sections", "values": [{"name": "JUDGES AND JUDGING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GENH-219-301", "path": "/courses/3023/sections/301", "id": "3023-301", "aliases": ["GENH-219-301"]}]}, "id": 3023, "aliases": ["GENH-219"]}
