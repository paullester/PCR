{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/523"}, "description": "All societies have confronted the problem of the existence of Evil. Is it inherent in the universe, due to Man, due to Supernatural beings or what? This course will consider such thinking in literature, in philosophy and in the visual arts. We will examine pertinent material in Zoroastrian dualism, Greek neo-platonism and the Old Testament as background for Western European thinking. Using primary texts as much as possible we will look at such major figures as Dante, Marlowe, Milton, Goethe, Blake, Dostoyevsky among others. We will consider dualism in Manichean and Cathar history. We will survey the Devil in the visual arts from Ravenna mosaics to Breugel, Bosch, Blake and others. We will see the extraordinary change in thinking about the Devil--from the source of all Evil to the greatest of Romantic rebels. The course will require discussion from all students as well as some writing and there will be a final examination. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "EVIL AND THE DEVIL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/523/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.08", "rStimulateInterest": "1.83", "rRecommendMajor": "2.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "2.58", "rInstructorQuality": "2.58"}, "section": {"name": "EVIL AND THE DEVIL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GENH-220-301", "path": "/courses/523/sections/301", "id": "523-301", "aliases": ["GENH-220-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/523/sections/301/reviews/566-PAUL-T-MAKLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/566-PAUL-T-MAKLER", "first_name": "PAUL T", "last_name": "MAKLER", "id": "566-PAUL-T-MAKLER", "name": "PAUL T MAKLER"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "523-301-566-PAUL-T-MAKLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GENH-220", "path": "/courses/523", "sections": {"path": "/courses/523/sections", "values": [{"name": "EVIL AND THE DEVIL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "GENH-220-301", "path": "/courses/523/sections/301", "id": "523-301", "aliases": ["GENH-220-301"]}]}, "id": 523, "aliases": ["GENH-220"]}
