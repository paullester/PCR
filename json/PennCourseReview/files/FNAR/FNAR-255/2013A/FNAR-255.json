{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4245"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to bookmaking terms, techniques, and structures, typography, contemporary works, design foundations and book layout, as well as the reasons for practicing or challenging a conceptual approach to working in the book form. Students will learn a variety of structures and discover new ways of incorporating text and image by integrating letterpress, woodcut, linoleum and digital systems in an experimental context. Book Art is a time-based medium that challenges our contemporary concepts of reading and seeing, in a form that invites a unique and tactile intimacy with the viewer. These challenges demand that the artist strive for qualities that engage the senses, the imagination, and the intellect. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "BOOK ARTS & LETTERPRESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30294/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.57", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "BOOK ARTS & LETTERPRESS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-255-401", "path": "/courses/30294/sections/401", "id": "30294-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-255-401", "FNAR-555-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/30294/sections/401/reviews/5350-TRICIA-TREACY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5350-TRICIA-TREACY", "first_name": "TRICIA", "last_name": "TREACY", "id": "5350-TRICIA-TREACY", "name": "TRICIA TREACY"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "30294-401-5350-TRICIA-TREACY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-255", "path": "/courses/30294", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30294/sections", "values": [{"name": "BOOK ARTS & LETTERPRESS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-255-401", "path": "/courses/30294/sections/401", "id": "30294-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-255-401", "FNAR-555-401"]}]}, "id": 30294, "aliases": ["FNAR-255", "FNAR-555"]}
