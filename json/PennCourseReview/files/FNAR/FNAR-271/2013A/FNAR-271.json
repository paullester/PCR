Students will learn how to expose and process 35mm film, SLR camera operation, darkroom procedures & printing, basic lighting and controlled applications. It begins with an emphasis on understanding and mastering technical procedures and evolves into an investigation of the creative and expressive possibilities of making images. This is a project-based course, where students will begin to develop their personal vision, their understanding of aesthetic issues and photographic history. Assignments, ideas and important examples of contemporary art will be presented via a series of slide lectures, critiques and discussion. No previous experience necessary. 35mm SLR cameras will be available throughout the semester for reservation and checkout from the photography equipment room. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRO TO PHOTOGRAPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30303/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rTAQuality": "2.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "2.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "3.22", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-271-401", "path": "/courses/30303/sections/401", "id": "30303-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-271-401", "FNAR-571-401", "VLST-271-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/30303/sections/401/reviews/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "first_name": "KAREN", "last_name": "RODEWALD", "id": "502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "name": "KAREN RODEWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "30303-401-502-KAREN-RODEWALD"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rTAQuality": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.60", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-271-402", "path": "/courses/30303/sections/402", "id": "30303-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-271-402", "FNAR-571-402", "VLST-271-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/30303/sections/402/reviews/2968-BRENT-WAHL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2968-BRENT-WAHL", "first_name": "BRENT", "last_name": "WAHL", "id": "2968-BRENT-WAHL", "name": "BRENT WAHL"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "30303-402-2968-BRENT-WAHL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-271", "path": "/courses/30303", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30303/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-271-401", "path": "/courses/30303/sections/401", "id": "30303-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-271-401", "FNAR-571-401", "VLST-271-401"]}, {"name": "INTRO TO PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-271-402", "path": "/courses/30303/sections/402", "id": "30303-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-271-402", "FNAR-571-402", "VLST-271-402"]}]}, "id": 30303, "aliases": ["FNAR-271", "FNAR-571", "VLST-271"]}
