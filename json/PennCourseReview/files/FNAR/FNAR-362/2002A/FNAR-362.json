{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/475"}, "description": "The purpose of this class is to expand the student's knowledge of ceramic processes. Handbuilding techniques such as coil building and slab construction will be reviewed as well as the potter's wheel. A greater emphasis will be placed on glaze chemistry, surface, and the firing process. Students will gain a broader knowledge of both electric and gas kiln firing processes. Exploring local clay institutions, such as the Clay Studio in Old City Philadelphia and the Moravian Tile Works in Doylestown will introduce students to the local ceramic resources that have played a significant role in the history of American ceramics. Raku firing, how to make two and three part slip cast molds, printmaking and ceramics and the introduction of the computer into the art making process can be expected. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CLAY II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/475/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "CLAY II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-362-401", "path": "/courses/475/sections/401", "id": "475-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-362-401", "FNAR-564-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/475/sections/401/reviews/491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY", "first_name": "MATTHEW", "last_name": "COURTNEY", "id": "491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY", "name": "MATTHEW COURTNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "475-401-491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-362", "path": "/courses/475", "sections": {"path": "/courses/475/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLAY II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-362-401", "path": "/courses/475/sections/401", "id": "475-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-362-401", "FNAR-564-401"]}]}, "id": 475, "aliases": ["FNAR-362", "FNAR-564"]}
