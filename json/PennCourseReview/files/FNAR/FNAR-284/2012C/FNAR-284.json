{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5216"}, "description": "Since the invention of photography, the fashion industry has been one of the cornerstones of creative expression, innovation and visionary provocation. Contemporary fashion photography has continued to attract a leading group of image-makers that continue the tradition of creating artwork that not only is being published in cutting edge magazines such as V, Another Magazine and Citizen K, but also are exhibiting their work in various galleries and museums around the world. This course is designed for students who are interested in creating contemporary fashion images through specific assignments that define the process: lighting in studio or location, working with fashion designers, stylists, models, hair/ make up artists, and the application of a variety of post production techniques, via Photoshop. The class will explore modern constructs that define the importance of branding, marketing, advertising and the relationship of fashion photography in contemporary art and culture today. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "PHOTOGRAPHY & FASHION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28949/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "PHOTOGRAPHY & FASHION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-284-401", "path": "/courses/28949/sections/401", "id": "28949-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-284-401", "FNAR-684-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/28949/sections/401/reviews/5353-TONY-WARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5353-TONY-WARD", "first_name": "TONY", "last_name": "WARD", "id": "5353-TONY-WARD", "name": "TONY WARD"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "28949-401-5353-TONY-WARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-284", "path": "/courses/28949", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28949/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHOTOGRAPHY & FASHION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-284-401", "path": "/courses/28949/sections/401", "id": "28949-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-284-401", "FNAR-684-401"]}]}, "id": 28949, "aliases": ["FNAR-284", "FNAR-684"]}
