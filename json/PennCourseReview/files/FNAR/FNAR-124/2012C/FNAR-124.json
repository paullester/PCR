{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/448"}, "description": "Drawing II is designed to continue the refinement of skills acquired in Drawing I, and to deepen and expand the student's involvement with drawing. The semester begins with observational work, reviewing processes and skills acquired in Drawing I while expanding on concepts and meaning in drawing. The class will also introduce color, abstract agendas, conceptual problem solving, and collaborative exercises, as well as new materials, techniques and large format drawings. Experimentation with scale, media and process allow students to develop a personal approach to expression through drawing. As the semester advances, projects are thematic or conceptually based, and are designed to advance familiarity with a variety of approaches to drawing. The goal is to strengthen facility, develop clarity in intent, and expand expression. In addition to drawing projects, students are required to research contemporary and art historical examples, and will become familiar with precedents for the visual ideas they are learning about in the studio. Students are also required to present their work and discuss their classmate's work during frequent class critiques. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DRAWING II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28927/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.57", "rDifficulty": "3.07", "rTAQuality": "3.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "DRAWING II", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-124-402", "path": "/courses/28927/sections/402", "id": "28927-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-124-402", "FNAR-524-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/28927/sections/402/reviews/477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN", "first_name": "JOAN WADLEIGH", "last_name": "CURRAN", "id": "477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN", "name": "JOAN WADLEIGH CURRAN"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "28927-402-477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-124", "path": "/courses/28927", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28927/sections", "values": [{"name": "DRAWING II", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-124-402", "path": "/courses/28927/sections/402", "id": "28927-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-124-402", "FNAR-524-402"]}]}, "id": 28927, "aliases": ["FNAR-124", "FNAR-524"]}
