{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3090"}, "description": "This course will concentrate on expanding your imagery in print media. A wide variety of print techniques will be covered such as monoprinting, multi-plate color printing, photo-based intaglio, lithography and screenprinting. Techniques will be addressed as they serve the needs of your ideas rather than as a set technical procedure. Through individual consultation, scheduled class critiques, field trips, guest artists, and collaborative projects, attention will be given to to your work in and out of printmaking so that the technical and conceptual strengths of print media can serve as a worthwhile adjunct to your overall work. Independent work outside of class is expected and printmaking experience is highly recommended. $40 Studio fee. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "PRINTMAKING: MIXED MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14485/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.67", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "PRINTMAKING: MIXED MEDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-257-401", "path": "/courses/14485/sections/401", "id": "14485-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-257-401", "FNAR-557-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/14485/sections/401/reviews/2961-MATTHEW-J--NEFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2961-MATTHEW-J--NEFF", "first_name": "MATTHEW J.", "last_name": "NEFF", "id": "2961-MATTHEW-J--NEFF", "name": "MATTHEW J.
