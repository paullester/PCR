{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2578"}, "description": "The course will stimulate students to create photography-based works of art that break from traditional practices to venture into exploring the various methods and materials of installation, public works, and/or assemblage. The class will be working on a group effort, various collaborative projects, and on individual installations. In creating these installation works students will not only be encouraged to cross disciplines (for example, to incorporate aspects of drawing or sculpture into their porjects), but to also make work for specific sites in and around campus. Technical demonstrations for this course include: mural printing, various transfer processes, alternative darkroom techniques, use of hand-applied light sensitive liquid emulsions, etc. $50 Studio Fee. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ADVNACED TOPICS IN PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTO-BASED INSTALLATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24411/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ADVNACED TOPICS IN PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTO-BASED INSTALLATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-282-401", "path": "/courses/24411/sections/401", "id": "24411-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-282-401", "FNAR-582-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/24411/sections/401/reviews/503-GABRIEL-MARTINEZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/503-GABRIEL-MARTINEZ", "first_name": "GABRIEL", "last_name": "MARTINEZ", "id": "503-GABRIEL-MARTINEZ", "name": "GABRIEL MARTINEZ"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "24411-401-503-GABRIEL-MARTINEZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-282", "path": "/courses/24411", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24411/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVNACED TOPICS IN PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTO-BASED INSTALLATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-282-401", "path": "/courses/24411/sections/401", "id": "24411-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-282-401", "FNAR-582-401"]}]}, "id": 24411, "aliases": ["FNAR-282", "FNAR-582"]}
