{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/468"}, "description": "The objective of this class is to explore the many ways of interpretive photographic portraiture. An awareness of historical perspective, technical developments, physiognomy and proxemics will be discussed in order to gain a better understanding of the context of photographic portraiture. Natural and artificial lighting demonstrations will be presented to illustrate the importance of their relationship to the interpretive portrait. Any photographic medium (film - black and white or color - or digital)will be accepted, providing the skill and quality are apparent. There will be an assignment given each week at the beginning of each class and prints/CD's will be due the following week. The final project will be an extended portrait project of your choice. $50 Studio Fee. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PORTRAIT AND THE NUDE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6541/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "PORTRAIT AND THE NUDE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-274-401", "path": "/courses/6541/sections/401", "id": "6541-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-274-401", "FNAR-574-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/6541/sections/401/reviews/501-BECKY-YOUNG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/501-BECKY-YOUNG", "first_name": "BECKY", "last_name": "YOUNG", "id": "501-BECKY-YOUNG", "name": "BECKY YOUNG"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "6541-401-501-BECKY-YOUNG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-274", "path": "/courses/6541", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6541/sections", "values": [{"name": "PORTRAIT AND THE NUDE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-274-401", "path": "/courses/6541/sections/401", "id": "6541-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-274-401", "FNAR-574-401"]}]}, "id": 6541, "aliases": ["FNAR-274", "FNAR-574"]}
