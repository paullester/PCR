{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4244"}, "description": "This course will concentrate on expanding imagery in print media. A wide variety of print techniques will be covered. Techniques will be addressed as they serve the needs of ideas rather than a set technical procedure. Through individualconsultation, scheduled class critiques, field trips, guest artists, and collaborative projects, attention will be given to studio work in and out of printmaking so that the technical and conceptual strengths of print media can serve as a worthwhile adjunct to an overall studio practice. The course requires the proposal of a directed project to be explored in this seminar. $40 Studio Fee. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ADV PROJECTS PRINTMAKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27398/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "ADV PROJECTS PRINTMAKING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-253-401", "path": "/courses/27398/sections/401", "id": "27398-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-253-401", "FNAR-553-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/27398/sections/401/reviews/5349-VIRGIL-M-MARTI-JR-", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5349-VIRGIL-M-MARTI-JR-", "first_name": "VIRGIL M", "last_name": "MARTI JR.", "id": "5349-VIRGIL-M-MARTI-JR-", "name": "VIRGIL M MARTI JR."}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "27398-401-5349-VIRGIL-M-MARTI-JR-"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-253", "path": "/courses/27398", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27398/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV PROJECTS PRINTMAKING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-253-401", "path": "/courses/27398/sections/401", "id": "27398-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-253-401", "FNAR-553-401"]}]}, "id": 27398, "aliases": ["FNAR-253", "FNAR-553"]}
