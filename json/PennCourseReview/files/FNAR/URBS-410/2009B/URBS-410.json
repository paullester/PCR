{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1139"}, "description": "This course will explore methods for examining the role that arts and cultural activities play in urban communities and its implications for urban policy. The course will focus on: 1) examining theories of culture's social impact and how they might be used to formulate research; 2) methods for conducting research on arts and culture; and 3) how cultural research is relevant for various spheres of urban policy, including community development, urban economies, and the needs of children and youth. The major project for the course will require students to collaborate with community resources in studying the connection of theory, research, and policy. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "Urban Communities and the Arts", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16873/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "Urban Communities and the Arts", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "URBS-410-910", "path": "/courses/16873/sections/910", "id": "16873-910", "aliases": ["URBS-410-910", "URBS-510-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/16873/sections/910/reviews/1203-MARK-J--STERN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1203-MARK-J--STERN", "first_name": "MARK J.", "last_name": "STERN", "id": "1203-MARK-J--STERN", "name": "MARK J.
