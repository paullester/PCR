{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/467"}, "description": "This studio course seeks to broaden each student's skills by experimenting with a wide range of photographic media. Advanced analog, digital and experimental lens-based techniques will be covered, as well as larger camera formats to expand their vocabulary as image-makers. Emphasis will be on an integrated experience of the photographic medium and the development of a body of work that is both theoretically and historically informed. The course will be a means to view and discuss various strategies of important contemporary photographers. Focused assignments, readings, slide lectures and gallery visits will supplement each student's artistic practice and research. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE PHOTOGRAPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28946/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "1.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-272-401", "path": "/courses/28946/sections/401", "id": "28946-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-272-401", "FNAR-572-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/28946/sections/401/reviews/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "first_name": "KAREN", "last_name": "RODEWALD", "id": "502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "name": "KAREN RODEWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "28946-401-502-KAREN-RODEWALD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-272", "path": "/courses/28946", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28946/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-272-401", "path": "/courses/28946/sections/401", "id": "28946-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-272-401", "FNAR-572-401"]}]}, "id": 28946, "aliases": ["FNAR-272", "FNAR-572"]}
