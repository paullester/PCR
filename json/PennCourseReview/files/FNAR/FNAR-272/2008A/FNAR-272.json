{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/467"}, "description": "This intermediate photography course will expand on traditional black and whit techniques by using various types of films, fiber printing papers and advanced darkroom procedures. The basics of the Zone System, advanced metering, studio lighting and 4x5 view camera will be introduced as well as medium format Hasselblad camera systems. A wide array of traditional (and non) photographic techniques will be covered to provide a \"toolbox\" of processes that will expand the students' vocabulary as image-makers. Emphasis will be on exploring and mastering these different approaches as we begin to identify how these different processes - and how they look - can contribute to meaning in a work of art. Throughout the course students will be guided toward the creation of work that is both technically and conceptually realized. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course, providing an introduction into the possibilities of hybrid platforms. Th examination of both historic and comtemporary photographs will supplement this research. The finalproject will be a developed portfolio of prints based on oneidea or theme. Labfee: $50.00. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "PHOTOGRAPHY II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20185/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "PHOTOGRAPHY II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-272-401", "path": "/courses/20185/sections/401", "id": "20185-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-272-401", "FNAR-572-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/20185/sections/401/reviews/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "first_name": "KAREN", "last_name": "RODEWALD", "id": "502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "name": "KAREN RODEWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "20185-401-502-KAREN-RODEWALD"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.83", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "PHOTOGRAPHY II", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-272-402", "path": "/courses/20185/sections/402", "id": "20185-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-272-402", "FNAR-572-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/20185/sections/402/reviews/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "first_name": "KAREN", "last_name": "RODEWALD", "id": "502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "name": "KAREN RODEWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "20185-402-502-KAREN-RODEWALD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-272", "path": "/courses/20185", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20185/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHOTOGRAPHY II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-272-401", "path": "/courses/20185/sections/401", "id": "20185-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-272-401", "FNAR-572-401"]}, {"name": "PHOTOGRAPHY II", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-272-402", "path": "/courses/20185/sections/402", "id": "20185-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-272-402", "FNAR-572-402"]}]}, "id": 20185, "aliases": ["FNAR-272", "FNAR-572"]}
