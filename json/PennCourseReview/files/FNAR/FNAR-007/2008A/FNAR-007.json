{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4809"}, "description": "An introduction to three-dimensional art through clay, this course introduces students to the fundamental language of object making through hands-on experience with clay materials. Students develop their visual skills by creating sculptural forms as well as pottery forms such as cups, bowls and jars. Each project is presented with clear demonstrations and individual instructions. The first half of the semester will focus on hand-building methods which include pinching, coiling, and slab-building. The students will learn how to throw at a potter's wheel during the latter half of the semester. Reading assignments, slide presentations and a field trip broaden the understanding of object making. $40 Studio Fee. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "FEAT OF CLAY,THE ARCANUM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20151/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "2.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.42", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "1.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.58", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "FEAT OF CLAY,THE ARCANUM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-007-301", "path": "/courses/20151/sections/301", "id": "20151-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-007-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/20151/sections/301/reviews/491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY", "first_name": "MATTHEW", "last_name": "COURTNEY", "id": "491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY", "name": "MATTHEW COURTNEY"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "20151-301-491-MATTHEW-COURTNEY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.42", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "1.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.08", "rWorkRequired": "3.42", "rInstructorAccess": "2.00", "rReadingsValue": "0.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.58", "rCommAbility": "1.08", "rInstructorQuality": "1.58"}, "section": {"name": "FEAT OF CLAY,THE ARCANUM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-007-301", "path": "/courses/20151/sections/301", "id": "20151-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-007-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/20151/sections/301/reviews/492-SUMI-MAESHIMA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/492-SUMI-MAESHIMA", "first_name": "SUMI", "last_name": "MAESHIMA", "id": "492-SUMI-MAESHIMA", "name": "SUMI MAESHIMA"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "20151-301-492-SUMI-MAESHIMA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-007", "path": "/courses/20151", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20151/sections", "values": [{"name": "FEAT OF CLAY,THE ARCANUM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-007-301", "path": "/courses/20151/sections/301", "id": "20151-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-007-301"]}]}, "id": 20151, "aliases": ["FNAR-007"]}
