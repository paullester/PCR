{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5661"}, "description": "Modeling and casting are fundamental methods of object-making. Students will learn basic handbuilding techniques such as coil building, slab construction, and mold making through assignments that incorporate conceptual and technical issues. Through experimentation with these methods, this course promotes an understanding of materials, processes, visual concepts, and techniques for creating three-dimensional forms in space. In addition to using different water-based clays and plaster, other materials such as wax, plastiline, paper pulp, cardboard, and tar paper will be explored. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "CASTING AND HANDBUILDING: METHODS IN CLAY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30295/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rTAQuality": "3.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "CASTING AND HANDBUILDING: METHODS IN CLAY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-259-401", "path": "/courses/30295/sections/401", "id": "30295-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-259-401", "FNAR-559-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/30295/sections/401/reviews/492-SUMI-MAESHIMA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/492-SUMI-MAESHIMA", "first_name": "SUMI", "last_name": "MAESHIMA", "id": "492-SUMI-MAESHIMA", "name": "SUMI MAESHIMA"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "30295-401-492-SUMI-MAESHIMA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-259", "path": "/courses/30295", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30295/sections", "values": [{"name": "CASTING AND HANDBUILDING: METHODS IN CLAY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-259-401", "path": "/courses/30295/sections/401", "id": "30295-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-259-401", "FNAR-559-401"]}]}, "id": 30295, "aliases": ["FNAR-259", "FNAR-559"]}
