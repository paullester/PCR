{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2577"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to the fundamental perception, representation, aesthetics, and design that shape today's visual culture. It addresses the way artists and designers create images; design with analog and digital tools; communicate, exchange, and express meaning over broad range of media; and find their voices within the fabric of contemporary art, design, and visual culture. Emphasis is placed on building an extended form of visual literacy by studying and making images using a variety of representation techniques; learning to organize and structure two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, and designing with time-based and procedural media. Students learn to develop an individual style of idea-generation, experimentation, iteration, and critique as part of their creative and critical responses to visual culture. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30298/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rTAQuality": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "1.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "2.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-401", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/401", "id": "30298-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-401", "FNAR-636-401", "VLST-264-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30298/sections/401/reviews/5347-SCOTTY-REIFSNYDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5347-SCOTTY-REIFSNYDER", "first_name": "SCOTTY", "last_name": "REIFSNYDER", "id": "5347-SCOTTY-REIFSNYDER", "name": "SCOTTY REIFSNYDER"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "30298-401-5347-SCOTTY-REIFSNYDER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.46", "rTAQuality": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.07", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "3.07", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.79", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-402", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/402", "id": "30298-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-402", "FNAR-636-402", "VLST-264-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30298/sections/402/reviews/4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "first_name": "KEITH W", "last_name": "FLEDDERMAN", "id": "4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "name": "KEITH W FLEDDERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "30298-402-4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.33", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rTAQuality": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.41", "rWorkRequired": "2.87", "rInstructorAccess": "2.53", "rReadingsValue": "1.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "2.27", "rInstructorQuality": "2.41"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "403", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-403", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/403", "id": "30298-403", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-403", "FNAR-636-403", "VLST-264-403"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/30298/sections/403/reviews/4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "first_name": "KEITH W", "last_name": "FLEDDERMAN", "id": "4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "name": "KEITH W FLEDDERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "30298-403-4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rTAQuality": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "3.36", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "2.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.08"}, "section": {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "404", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-404", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/404", "id": "30298-404", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-404", "FNAR-636-404", "VLST-264-404"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/30298/sections/404/reviews/4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "first_name": "KEITH W", "last_name": "FLEDDERMAN", "id": "4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN", "name": "KEITH W FLEDDERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "30298-404-4325-KEITH-W-FLEDDERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-264", "path": "/courses/30298", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30298/sections", "values": [{"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-401", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/401", "id": "30298-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-401", "FNAR-636-401", "VLST-264-401"]}, {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-402", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/402", "id": "30298-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-402", "FNAR-636-402", "VLST-264-402"]}, {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "403", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-403", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/403", "id": "30298-403", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-403", "FNAR-636-403", "VLST-264-403"]}, {"name": "DIGITAL DESIGN FOUNDATIONS", "sectionnum": "404", "primary_alias": "FNAR-264-404", "path": "/courses/30298/sections/404", "id": "30298-404", "aliases": ["FNAR-264-404", "FNAR-636-404", "VLST-264-404"]}]}, "id": 30298, "aliases": ["FNAR-264", "FNAR-636", "VLST-264"]}
