Instruction will include usability, graphic design, web terminology, appropriate file protocoling, information architecture planning, communication strategies and www identity design. Upon completion of this course, students will possess a working knowledge of how to organize and design full web page content for interactive online user interfacing or control-group presentation. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "WEB DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23060/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.56", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "WEB DESIGN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-234-401", "path": "/courses/23060/sections/401", "id": "23060-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-234-401", "FNAR-634-401"]}, "comments": "\r\nThis course is designed to introduce the student to web presentation, theory, techniques and current software applications including Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Dreamweaver and Macromedia Flash.
