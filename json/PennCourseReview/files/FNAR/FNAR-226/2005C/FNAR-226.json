{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3740"}, "description": "This is a non-studio course in the photography of buildings, streetscapes, and cities. It is designed for photographers interested in the built environment as subject matter, as well as for architecture and planning students. We will hone pratical skills in perspective control, lighting, and photographic interpretation of space, so that photographers, architects and planners can better photograph precedents and their own projects, and better evaluate the use of professional architectural photography for promotion and education. $50 Studio Fee. \n\nAnyone who owns a digital or film camera (including point-and-shoot) is qualified; no darkroom or Photoshop experience needed. Professional view camera techniques will be covered at a basic level. \n\nThe course will consist equally of slide lectures, discussions, and location shooting at Philadelphia residential, commercial, and industrial sites. Student images (digital or traditional) will be transferred to PowerPoint for class critique. Readings and discussions may range into issues of architectural and urban planning theory and philosophy that affect the interpretation of the built environment and how its image is perceived. Both documentary and fine art approaches will be covered. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF URBAN PLACE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11807/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.09", "rDifficulty": "1.73", "rStimulateInterest": "2.55", "rRecommendMajor": "2.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "2.91", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "2.18", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF URBAN PLACE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-226-401", "path": "/courses/11807/sections/401", "id": "11807-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-226-401", "URBS-226-401", "FNAR-626-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/11807/sections/401/reviews/3650-SANDRA-SORLIEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3650-SANDRA-SORLIEN", "first_name": "SANDRA", "last_name": "SORLIEN", "id": "3650-SANDRA-SORLIEN", "name": "SANDRA SORLIEN"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "11807-401-3650-SANDRA-SORLIEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-226", "path": "/courses/11807", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11807/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF URBAN PLACE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-226-401", "path": "/courses/11807/sections/401", "id": "11807-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-226-401", "URBS-226-401", "FNAR-626-401"]}]}, "id": 11807, "aliases": ["FNAR-226", "URBS-226", "FNAR-626"]}
