{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3640"}, "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to familiarize freshmen with the intellectual pursuit of creativity. Through lectures, followed by a period of class discussions on the topic of the day and a visual diary, the student's mind will begin to understand art's serious place in society and how the pursuit of creating original art is an inherited, natural desire, programmed within our genes. \n\nThe need to become keen observers of nature will be stressed, from the brain down to the molecular level, back to the mind's own will power and out to the vast, surrounding university permeated with infinite mysteries, which we can begin to comprehend once we maintain an open mind and allow ourselves to experience awe and humility. The ancient role of an artist is to hold witness, each in her and his way, to nature's meaning. \n\nEach student will be required to take notes of their impressions and imaginations and these should be in both written and pictorial form. An effort to pursue originality is the key. By the end of the semester, each student should have a unique \"book\" comprised of their interpretation of ideas, freshly received from the entire class.
