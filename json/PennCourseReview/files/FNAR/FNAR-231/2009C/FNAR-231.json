{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/454"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to painting with emphasis on formal principles, content and expression. The course will explore the technical application of paint as well as the impact of a range of compositional and color strategies. Working from direct observation, members of the course will develop perceptual skills to create convincing relationships of form in space. The studio course assignments will be supported by lectures that introduce both contemporary and historical precedents in painting. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "PAINTING I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17344/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "PAINTING I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-401", "path": "/courses/17344/sections/401", "id": "17344-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-401", "FNAR-531-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/17344/sections/401/reviews/477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN", "first_name": "JOAN WADLEIGH", "last_name": "CURRAN", "id": "477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN", "name": "JOAN WADLEIGH CURRAN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "17344-401-477-JOAN-WADLEIGH-CURRAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "1.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "PAINTING I", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-402", "path": "/courses/17344/sections/402", "id": "17344-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-402", "FNAR-531-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/17344/sections/402/reviews/4801-MARY-E-HENDERSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4801-MARY-E-HENDERSON", "first_name": "MARY E", "last_name": "HENDERSON", "id": "4801-MARY-E-HENDERSON", "name": "MARY E HENDERSON"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "17344-402-4801-MARY-E-HENDERSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-231", "path": "/courses/17344", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17344/sections", "values": [{"name": "PAINTING I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-401", "path": "/courses/17344/sections/401", "id": "17344-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-401", "FNAR-531-401"]}, {"name": "PAINTING I", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-402", "path": "/courses/17344/sections/402", "id": "17344-402", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-402", "FNAR-531-402"]}]}, "id": 17344, "aliases": ["FNAR-231", "FNAR-531"]}
