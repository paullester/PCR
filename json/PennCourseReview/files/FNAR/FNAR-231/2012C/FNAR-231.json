{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/454"}, "description": "Painting practices is an introduction to the methods and materials of oil painting. This course begins with an investigation of color and color relationships. The beginning of the semester will cover technical issues and develop the student's ability to create a convincing sense of form in space using mass, color, light and composition. The majority of work is from direct observation including object study, still life, landscape, interior and exterior space and the self portrait. Class problems advance sequentially with attention paid to perceptual clarity, the selection and development of imagery, the process of synthesis and translation, color, structure and composition, content and personal expression. Students will become familiar with contemporary and art historical precedent in order to familiarize them with the history of visual ideas and find appropriate solutions to their painting problems. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRO TO PAINTING PRACTI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28932/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO PAINTING PRACTI", "sectionnum": "202", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-202", "path": "/courses/28932/sections/202", "id": "28932-202", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-202", "FNAR-531-202"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/28932/sections/202/reviews/6266-MARK-P-DILKS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6266-MARK-P-DILKS", "first_name": "MARK P", "last_name": "DILKS", "id": "6266-MARK-P-DILKS", "name": "MARK P DILKS"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "28932-202-6266-MARK-P-DILKS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rTAQuality": "3.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO PAINTING PRACTI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-401", "path": "/courses/28932/sections/401", "id": "28932-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-401", "FNAR-531-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/28932/sections/401/reviews/471-DEIRDRE-MURPHY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/471-DEIRDRE-MURPHY", "first_name": "DEIRDRE", "last_name": "MURPHY", "id": "471-DEIRDRE-MURPHY", "name": "DEIRDRE MURPHY"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "28932-401-471-DEIRDRE-MURPHY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-231", "path": "/courses/28932", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28932/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO PAINTING PRACTI", "sectionnum": "202", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-202", "path": "/courses/28932/sections/202", "id": "28932-202", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-202", "FNAR-531-202"]}, {"name": "INTRO TO PAINTING PRACTI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-231-401", "path": "/courses/28932/sections/401", "id": "28932-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-231-401", "FNAR-531-401"]}]}, "id": 28932, "aliases": ["FNAR-231", "FNAR-531"]}
