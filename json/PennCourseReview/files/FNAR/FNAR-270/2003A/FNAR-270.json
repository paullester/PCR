The studio works with two clients each semester, and previous projects have included print design, web design, interpretive signage and exhibit interactives. All projects are real and will result in a portfolio-ready finished product. Students will participate in a full design experience including design, client interaction, presentations, production, and project management. In addition, students will take field trips, meet professionals and go on studio visits. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "GRAPHIC DESIGN PRACTICUM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1632/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "GRAPHIC DESIGN PRACTICUM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-270-401", "path": "/courses/1632/sections/401", "id": "1632-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-270-401", "FNAR-570-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/1632/sections/401/reviews/1414-LAURA-C--CHURCHMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1414-LAURA-C--CHURCHMAN", "first_name": "LAURA C.", "last_name": "CHURCHMAN", "id": "1414-LAURA-C--CHURCHMAN", "name": "LAURA C.
