The studio works with two clients each semester, and previous projects have included print design, web design, interpretive signage and exhibit interactives. All projects are real and will result in a portfolio-ready finished product. Students will participate in a full design experience including design, client interaction, presentations, production, and project management. In addition, students will take field trips, meet professionals and go on studio visits. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "GRAPHIC DESIGN PRACTICUM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26041/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.89", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.78", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "GRAPHIC DESIGN PRACTICUM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-270-401", "path": "/courses/26041/sections/401", "id": "26041-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-270-401", "FNAR-570-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/26041/sections/401/reviews/1847-DAVID-P--COMBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1847-DAVID-P--COMBERG", "first_name": "DAVID P.", "last_name": "COMBERG", "id": "1847-DAVID-P--COMBERG", "name": "DAVID P.
