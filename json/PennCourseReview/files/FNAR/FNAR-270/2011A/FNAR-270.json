The studio works with two clients each semester, and previous projects have included print design, web design, interpretive signage and exhibit interactives. All projects are real and will result in a portfolio-ready finished product. Students will participate in a full design experience including design, client interaction, presentations, production, and project management. In addition, students will take field trips, meet professionals and go on studio visits. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "GRAPHIC DESIGN PRACTICUM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21702/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "GRAPHIC DESIGN PRACTICUM", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-270-401", "path": "/courses/21702/sections/401", "id": "21702-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-270-401", "FNAR-570-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/21702/sections/401/reviews/1847-DAVID-P--COMBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1847-DAVID-P--COMBERG", "first_name": "DAVID P.", "last_name": "COMBERG", "id": "1847-DAVID-P--COMBERG", "name": "DAVID P.
