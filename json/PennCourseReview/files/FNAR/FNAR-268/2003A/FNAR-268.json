{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/464"}, "description": "This is a research-based design studio that introduces new materials, fabrication, and prototyping techniques to develop a series of design proposals in response to this semester's theme: Cultures of Play. Students will work in an interdisciplinary environment towards building new kinds of visualizations, objects, machines, buildings, or environments that use play as a critical, generative, resistive, and creative strategy. Through design, we will explore the vocabulary of printed electronics, computational materials, liquid disposition, 3-D scanning and prototyping techniques and build proposals that can interface with complex social, cultural and environmental issues. We will expand the studio work with additional perspectives from guest speakers and visitors ranging from artists to toy company representatives. The outcome of the studio will be presented at an international conference/workshop. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "MULTI-MEDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1630/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-268", "path": "/courses/1630", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1630/sections", "values": [{"name": "MULTI-MEDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-268-401", "path": "/courses/1630/sections/401", "id": "1630-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-268-401", "FNAR-568-401"]}]}, "id": 1630, "aliases": ["FNAR-268", "FNAR-568"]}
