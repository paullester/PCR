{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/464"}, "description": "This course is a research-based design studio that introduces new materials, fabrication, and prototyping techniques to develop a series of design proposals in response to the theme: Cultures of Making. This semester of the studio will focus on thinking through the language of three new technologies - digital fabrication, printed electronic, and biosynthesis - to respond creatively and critically to emerging social, cultural, and environmental issues. Through lectures and hands-on-workshop students will produce three functional design prototypes to realize their ideas in different capacities and learn how to position their work within contemporary art, media and design. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTEGRATIVE DESIGN STUDIO: CULTURES OF MAKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30301/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rTAQuality": "3.88", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.22", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.22", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "INTEGRATIVE DESIGN STUDIO: CULTURES OF MAKING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-268-401", "path": "/courses/30301/sections/401", "id": "30301-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-268-401", "IPD-568-401", "FNAR-568-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/30301/sections/401/reviews/5352-ORKAN-TELHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5352-ORKAN-TELHAN", "first_name": "ORKAN", "last_name": "TELHAN", "id": "5352-ORKAN-TELHAN", "name": "ORKAN TELHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "30301-401-5352-ORKAN-TELHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-268", "path": "/courses/30301", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30301/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEGRATIVE DESIGN STUDIO: CULTURES OF MAKING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-268-401", "path": "/courses/30301/sections/401", "id": "30301-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-268-401", "IPD-568-401", "FNAR-568-401"]}]}, "id": 30301, "aliases": ["FNAR-268", "IPD-568", "FNAR-568"]}
