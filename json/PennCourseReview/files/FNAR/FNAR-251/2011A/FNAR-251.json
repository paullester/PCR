{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/458"}, "description": "Students will have the opportunity to explore the idea of reproducibility, process and experimentation. Zinc and Copper etching, as well as non-acid processes will be covered. Demonstrations involve processes as basic as drypoint and line etching to more advanced skills such as spit bite and multiple plate color printing. A good introduction to the arts for students with little or no experience; this course will provide a foundation on which to build, combining direct skills like drawing and painting with conceptualization, visualization, planning and professionalism. Though offering much technical information, the focus of the class will be image making and idea development. Students will be challenged to pursue themes personally important while completing smaller projects designed to master techniques. $40 Studio Fee \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "PRINTMAKING: INTAGLIO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21689/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "PRINTMAKING: INTAGLIO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-251-401", "path": "/courses/21689/sections/401", "id": "21689-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-251-401", "FNAR-551-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/21689/sections/401/reviews/3964-IVANCO-TALEVSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3964-IVANCO-TALEVSKI", "first_name": "IVANCO", "last_name": "TALEVSKI", "id": "3964-IVANCO-TALEVSKI", "name": "IVANCO TALEVSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "21689-401-3964-IVANCO-TALEVSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-251", "path": "/courses/21689", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21689/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRINTMAKING: INTAGLIO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-251-401", "path": "/courses/21689/sections/401", "id": "21689-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-251-401", "FNAR-551-401"]}]}, "id": 21689, "aliases": ["FNAR-251", "FNAR-551"]}
