Combining a digital stylus with a multi-layered computer application that allows real-time playback, innovative concepts and personal views will be communicated through clever graphics brought into motion. Emphasis will be placed on developing drawing skills. Line quality and weight and figure to space relationship on the flat animation stage will be examined. Acting with the figure, timing, and storytelling skills will be central in making a quick drawing with a splotch of color deliver a defined message within a restrictive amount of time and space.\r\n\r\nStudents thought that this was an \u201cexcellent course\u201d that covers both the business of animation and the techniques used. However, students interested in animation felt it may have been too business centric. \r\n\r\nProfessor Hagerty was described by many students as \u201cincredible\u201d but also \u201cextremely blunt\u201d when viewing students\u2019 work. Some students enjoyed his way of giving constructive criticism while others felt that his criticism caused a lack of individualism in students\u2019 work. Professor Hagerty was able to motivate students and seemed to enjoy talking about his experience in animation. However, some students felt that he could have spent class time more efficiently. \r\n\r\nStudents noted that the assignments were \u201cenjoyable\u201d and \u201cthought provoking.\u201d The workload was manageable and did not require an unreasonable amount of time to complete. Students were able to make constructive changes from the professor\u2019s comments.\r\n", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/23063/sections/401/reviews/4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY", "first_name": "ERINN E", "last_name": "HAGERTY", "id": "4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY", "name": "ERINN E HAGERTY"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "23063-401-4803-ERINN-E-HAGERTY"}]
