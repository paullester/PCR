{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/461"}, "description": "This course teaches students more advanced wheel throwing techniques while helping to develop their critical skills in other areas of ceramic work. Students will learn to throw, employing larger masses of clay, and to increase the complexity of their work by combining and altering thrown parts. There will be an emphasis on experimentation in surface treatment and design, the goal of which is to expand a student's ability to create more complicated and personalized clay works. In addition to learning the technical knowledge, there will be critical discussions of contemporary ceramics issues through image presentations, reading materials and field trips. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "CLAY WHEEL THROWING II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "CLAY WHEEL THROWING II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-263-401", "path": "/courses/28941/sections/401", "id": "28941-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-263-401", "FNAR-563-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/28941/sections/401/reviews/2963-RYAN-J--GREENHECK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2963-RYAN-J--GREENHECK", "first_name": "RYAN J.", "last_name": "GREENHECK", "id": "2963-RYAN-J--GREENHECK", "name": "RYAN J.
