{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4038"}, "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to familiarize freshmen with the intellectual pursuit of creativity. Through lectures, followed by a period of class discussions on the topic of the day and a visual diary, the student's mind will begin to understand art's serious place in society and how the pursuit of creating original art is an inherited, natural desire, programmed within our genes. The need to become keen observers of nature will be stressed, from the brain down to the molecular level, back to the mind's own will power and out to the vast, surrounding universe permeated with infinite mysteries, which we can begin to comprehend once we maintain an open mind and allow ourselves to experience awe and humanity. The ancient role of the artist is to hold witness, each in her and his way, to nature's meaning. Each student will be required to take notes of the impressions and imaginations and these should be recorded in both written and pictorial form. An effort to pursue originality is key. By the end of the semester, each student should have a unique \"book\" comprised of their interpratation of ideas, freshly received from the entire class. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "IN PURSUIT OF ORIGINALTY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14474/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.55", "rDifficulty": "1.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.18", "rRecommendMajor": "1.64", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.09", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.27", "rCommAbility": "1.82", "rInstructorQuality": "2.36"}, "section": {"name": "IN PURSUIT OF ORIGINALTY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-210-301", "path": "/courses/14474/sections/301", "id": "14474-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-210-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/14474/sections/301/reviews/2480-PAUL-S--FIERLINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2480-PAUL-S--FIERLINGER", "first_name": "PAUL S.", "last_name": "FIERLINGER", "id": "2480-PAUL-S--FIERLINGER", "name": "PAUL S.
