Emphasis will be placed on the photograph as a means of visual expression and the class is designed to treat color photography as both a technical and artistic medium. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course in order to illustrate and explore the full range of potential within color photography's trajectory and range. The examination of both historic and contemporary photographs will supplement our visual explorations. Lab fee: $50.00. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15752/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.86", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/15752/sections/401", "id": "15752-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-275-401", "FNAR-583-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/15752/sections/401/reviews/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "first_name": "KAREN", "last_name": "RODEWALD", "id": "502-KAREN-RODEWALD", "name": "KAREN RODEWALD"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "15752-401-502-KAREN-RODEWALD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-275", "path": "/courses/15752", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15752/sections", "values": [{"name": "COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/15752/sections/401", "id": "15752-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-275-401", "FNAR-583-401"]}]}, "id": 15752, "aliases": ["FNAR-275", "FNAR-583"]}
