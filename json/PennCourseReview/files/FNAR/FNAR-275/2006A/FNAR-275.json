{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/469"}, "description": "In this course students will begin to incorporate color into their technical and aesthetic photography arsenal. How film reacts to light and records color, how color influences the meaning of an image, and the development of a personal color sense will be explored through a series of assignments ranging from portrait to documentary to constructed photography. Topics covered will include: color theor, color temperatures, film and paper characteristics, push and pulll processing, filters, advanced metering techniques, a brief introduction to the 4x5 View Camera, medium format Hasselblad systems, basic flash and studio lighting, print spotting, presentation, content and context. Emphasis will be placed on the photograph as a means of visual expression and the class is designed to treat color photography as both a technical and artistic medium. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course in order to illustrate and explore the full range of potential within color photography's trajectory and range. The examination of both historic and contemporary photographs will supplement our visual explorations. Lab fee: $50.00. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7737/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-275-401", "path": "/courses/7737/sections/401", "id": "7737-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-275-401", "FNAR-583-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/7737/sections/401/reviews/505-JOHN-R--WOODIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/505-JOHN-R--WOODIN", "first_name": "JOHN R.", "last_name": "WOODIN", "id": "505-JOHN-R--WOODIN", "name": "JOHN R.
