{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4951"}, "description": "There are times that creativity cannot be shoe-horned into a studio. There are times that vision and craft must be able to control the tools of making an image. This introductory course on lighting is meant to expand the talents of photographers, whether they be fine art or documentary, and open up a new way of creating images - images that do not have to be created in Photoshop, but are created from the vision of the artist. In this class available light means whatever light is available: flash, tungsten, sunlight, or streetlight. The goal of this class is to allow the artist to grow in confidence and technical skill and to open their eyes to what they can create. Lab fee of $50.00 required. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "LIGHTING: EDITORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21705/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.80", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "2.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "LIGHTING: EDITORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-276-401", "path": "/courses/21705/sections/401", "id": "21705-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-276-401", "FNAR-676-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/21705/sections/401/reviews/2967-MICHAEL-J--BRYANT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2967-MICHAEL-J--BRYANT", "first_name": "MICHAEL J.", "last_name": "BRYANT", "id": "2967-MICHAEL-J--BRYANT", "name": "MICHAEL J.
