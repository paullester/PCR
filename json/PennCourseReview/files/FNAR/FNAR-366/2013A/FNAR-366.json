{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5416"}, "description": "Advanced 3-D Modeling will give students the opportunity to refine skills in modeling, texturing, lighting and rendering with an emphasis on the evolution of ideas through constant revision based on class critique. Students will use a variety of industry standard software packages, including, but not limited to Maya and Mudbox to compose complex environments. Projects are designed to give students the opportunity to work with original content within a simulated production environment. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ADVANCED 3D MODELING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30311/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rTAQuality": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED 3D MODELING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-366-401", "path": "/courses/30311/sections/401", "id": "30311-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-366-401", "FNAR-646-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/30311/sections/401/reviews/486-SCOTT-G--WHITE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/486-SCOTT-G--WHITE", "first_name": "SCOTT G.", "last_name": "WHITE", "id": "486-SCOTT-G--WHITE", "name": "SCOTT G.
