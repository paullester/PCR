With a heavy emphasis on project-oriented work, students will further their knowledge of manipulation, retouching and collage, as well as embarking on advanced color management and the use of digital photography in the studio environment. In addition to exploring these advanced imaging practices in their own work, students will also be required to critically examine the profound effects that new imaging technologies are having on art, journalism and the commercial realms. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "ADVANCED DIGITAL PHOTO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26054/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED DIGITAL PHOTO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-349-401", "path": "/courses/26054/sections/401", "id": "26054-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-349-401", "FNAR-649-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/26054/sections/401/reviews/2968-BRENT-WAHL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2968-BRENT-WAHL", "first_name": "BRENT", "last_name": "WAHL", "id": "2968-BRENT-WAHL", "name": "BRENT WAHL"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "26054-401-2968-BRENT-WAHL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-349", "path": "/courses/26054", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26054/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED DIGITAL PHOTO", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-349-401", "path": "/courses/26054/sections/401", "id": "26054-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-349-401", "FNAR-649-401"]}]}, "id": 26054, "aliases": ["FNAR-349", "FNAR-649"]}
