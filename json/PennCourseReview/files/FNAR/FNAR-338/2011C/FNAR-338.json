Students learn about different research methods from design, engineering, humanities and sciences; utilize them for developing and evaluating their individual creative work as cultural producers. This is an interdisciplinary course that encourages students to observe, measure, analyze, test, study, experiment, diagram, prototype, speculate, generate and criticize; apply multiple modes of inquiry; be conceptual, analytical, propositional and critical at the same time to develop their work from different perspectives. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CREATIVE RESEARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24413/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "3.22", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "CREATIVE RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-338-401", "path": "/courses/24413/sections/401", "id": "24413-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-338-401", "FNAR-638-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/24413/sections/401/reviews/5352-ORKAN-TELHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5352-ORKAN-TELHAN", "first_name": "ORKAN", "last_name": "TELHAN", "id": "5352-ORKAN-TELHAN", "name": "ORKAN TELHAN"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "24413-401-5352-ORKAN-TELHAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-338", "path": "/courses/24413", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24413/sections", "values": [{"name": "CREATIVE RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-338-401", "path": "/courses/24413/sections/401", "id": "24413-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-338-401", "FNAR-638-401"]}]}, "id": 24413, "aliases": ["FNAR-338", "FNAR-638"]}
