{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4039"}, "description": "Web Design II builds on the course content of Web Design I, expanding the student's knowledge of and practice with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. These client-side technologies, however, are limited to passive, one-way communications. In Web Design II, students will take their work a step further by making robust, interactive applications and art using PHP and other server side technologies. In addition to technical skills, instruction will be heavily framed around design strategies for the web. Students will be challenged to create clear, usable and visually interesting interactive interfaces. Over the course of the semester, students will experiment with net based art, data visualization and execute a complete interactive web application. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "WEB DESIGN II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20193/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "1.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "WEB DESIGN II", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "FNAR-335-401", "path": "/courses/20193/sections/401", "id": "20193-401", "aliases": ["FNAR-335-401", "FNAR-535-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/20193/sections/401/reviews/3300-GAVIN-C--COOPER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3300-GAVIN-C--COOPER", "first_name": "GAVIN C.", "last_name": "COOPER", "id": "3300-GAVIN-C--COOPER", "name": "GAVIN C.
