{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5415"}, "description": "How do images function? What kinds of images can be a critical language at this point in history? In what ways have the contemporary artists used photography as a tool for expression and communication? This course will explore and interrogate the key issues surrounding the medium of photography, led through these questions by lectures, group discussion and assignments/project-based work. Students will be asked to complete readings and photography assignments, make in-class presentations and complete a final written or photographic project. Students should have a strong interest in art history, philosophy and should be motivated to work independently, and experiment creatively. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "BEN FRANKLIN SEMINAR: PHOTOGRAPHIC THINKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27394/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.08", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rTAQuality": "2.92", "rStimulateInterest": "2.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.58", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "BEN FRANKLIN SEMINAR: PHOTOGRAPHIC THINKING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-239-301", "path": "/courses/27394/sections/301", "id": "27394-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-239-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/27394/sections/301/reviews/6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT", "first_name": "NANCY", "last_name": "DAVENPORT", "id": "6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT", "name": "NANCY DAVENPORT"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "27394-301-6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-239", "path": "/courses/27394", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27394/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEN FRANKLIN SEMINAR: PHOTOGRAPHIC THINKING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-239-301", "path": "/courses/27394/sections/301", "id": "27394-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-239-301"]}]}, "id": 27394, "aliases": ["FNAR-239"]}
