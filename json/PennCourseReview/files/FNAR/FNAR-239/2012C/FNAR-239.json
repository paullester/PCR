{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5415"}, "description": "This course will explore the vitality and range of photography as a discursive practice by analyzing the way images are structured and deployed in contemporary art and wider media culture. Students will be introduced to the key issues surrounding photography now- led through these questions by lectures, readings, group discussion and project-based work. A series of photo-assignments challenge the students to integrate critical thought with practice, exploring a range of formal strategies and thematic frameworks that affect the meaning of their images. Students should have a strong interest in philosophy and art histories (especially the history of photography.) They should be motivated to work independently & experiment creatively. There are no prerequisites for this course. It is intended for all different levels of technical experience, but the minimum requirements are a digital camera, a basic familiarity with Photoshop and access to a computer with imaging software. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "BEN FRANKLIN SEMINAR: PHOTOGRAPHIC THINKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28937/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "BEN FRANKLIN SEMINAR: PHOTOGRAPHIC THINKING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-239-301", "path": "/courses/28937/sections/301", "id": "28937-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-239-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/28937/sections/301/reviews/6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT", "first_name": "NANCY", "last_name": "DAVENPORT", "id": "6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT", "name": "NANCY DAVENPORT"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "28937-301-6094-NANCY-DAVENPORT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FNAR-239", "path": "/courses/28937", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28937/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEN FRANKLIN SEMINAR: PHOTOGRAPHIC THINKING", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FNAR-239-301", "path": "/courses/28937/sections/301", "id": "28937-301", "aliases": ["FNAR-239-301"]}]}, "id": 28937, "aliases": ["FNAR-239"]}
