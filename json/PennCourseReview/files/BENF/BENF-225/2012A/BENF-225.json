{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5378"}, "description": "The course will emphasize that sustainable intensification of agriculture, especially livestock and poultry production, is essential to provide adequate food supplies in the 21st century. We shall illustrate that organic farming methods, increasingly popular in the U.S. and Europe, use more land per pound of product, meat or milk, and can not feed the world. Students should understand that low intensity agriculture means increasing the area of land under cultivation, more deforestation, destruction of natural habitats, crowding of wildlife, and changes in the dynamics of disease transmission between wildlife and and humans. Concentrated animal feeding operations seem likely in SE Asia where 94% of arable land is already in cultivation. In other areas, Sub-Saharan Africa for example, land is available but it is degraded and agriculture is failing. Ways must be found to increase the productivity and and access to markets of small farming communities in SS Africa. \n\nOur goal is to make students think about the complexities of hunger and global food supplies. Students should realize that hunger already kills more people, principally infants, than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB combined. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27026/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.07", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "1.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.87", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.93", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BENF-225-301", "path": "/courses/27026/sections/301", "id": "27026-301", "aliases": ["BENF-225-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/27026/sections/301/reviews/6045-ALAN-M--KELLY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6045-ALAN-M--KELLY", "first_name": "ALAN M.", "last_name": "KELLY", "id": "6045-ALAN-M--KELLY", "name": "ALAN M.
