{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5686"}, "description": "Have you ever been tempted to tell half the truth when asked a question which seemed unfair? What does it mean to neither lie or tell the truth? How do people decide how to deal with questions they would just as soon not answer? This course will address this puzzle from mathematical, philosophical and empirical perspectives. The mathematical techniques involved include game theory, linear programming and geometry. The course will also involve field work about how half truths are constructed and told in different contexts. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THE MATH OF HALF-TRUTHS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30578/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.27", "rTAQuality": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.64", "rCourseQuality": "2.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.09", "rInstructorQuality": "2.91", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.55"}, "section": {"name": "THE MATH OF HALF-TRUTHS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MATH-212-301", "path": "/courses/30578/sections/301", "id": "30578-301", "aliases": ["MATH-212-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/30578/sections/301/reviews/1561-TED-C--K--CHINBURG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1561-TED-C--K--CHINBURG", "first_name": "TED C.
