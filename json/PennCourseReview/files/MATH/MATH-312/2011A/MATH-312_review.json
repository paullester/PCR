Students also said that the beginning of the class included a lot of review.\r\n\r\nStudents describe Professor Jauregui as a very organized instructor. Students were able to follow him easily in class. Professor Jauregui was said to be great at explaining concepts through various interpretations. The applications discussed in this course were very helpful in understanding the material. In addition, students found that Professor Jauregui made math interesting and applicable by showing students how math could be used in real life situations. Students felt that Professor Jauregui truly cared about his students. He was very accessible for extra help.\r\n\r\nThe Prerequisite for this course is MATH 240. Students who have already received credit for either Math 370, 371, 502 or 503 cannot receive further credit for Math 312 or Math 313/513. Mathematics majors are advised that MATH 312 cannot be taken to satisfy the major requirements. Students found that because no homework was assigned the course required a lot of personal initiative to excel. In addition, many students thought the difficulty of the exams could have been increased.\r\n", "num_students": 76, "path": "/courses/21999/sections/001/reviews/5404-JEFFREY-L--JAUREGUI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5404-JEFFREY-L--JAUREGUI", "first_name": "JEFFREY L.", "last_name": "JAUREGUI", "id": "5404-JEFFREY-L--JAUREGUI", "name": "JEFFREY L.
