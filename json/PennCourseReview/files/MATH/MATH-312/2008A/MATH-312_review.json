The class picks up where 240 left off with matrices, Gaussian eliminations, vectors and linear transformations, orthogonality, determinants, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.\r\n\r\nThe textbook for this course is Linear Algebra and its Applications, 4th edition, by Gilbert Strang.  Students rated the textbook as only fair; several complained that the text was not comprehensive enough for the course.\r\n\r\nAttendance for the class was taken each day by means of an attendance quiz, which did not count towards the students\u2019 grades.  The grade for the course was determined by 2 midterm exams, one final exam, and weekly homeworks.  There was no recitation for this course.\r\n\r\nThe class was highly recommended for minors, though not so much for students outside the minor.  Several students found the material to be \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201ctough,\u201d but felt that Professor Clee excelled at presenting complex ideas in a way that students could understand.  The only complaint about the professor\u2019s teaching style was that the material after the 1st midterm seemed \u201cdisjointed\u201d and \u201cdid not flow.\u201d \r\n\r\nOverall, however, students described Clee as a \u201cgreat professor\u201d and highly recommended him for future classes.  As one student commented, \u201cProfessor Clee [\u2026] not only makes complex material very clear and understandable, he makes math truly interesting.\u201d", "num_students": 106, "path": "/courses/20460/sections/001/reviews/743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE", "first_name": "WILLIAM A", "last_name": "CLEE", "id": "743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE", "name": "WILLIAM A CLEE"}, "num_reviewers": 82, "id": "20460-001-743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE"}]
