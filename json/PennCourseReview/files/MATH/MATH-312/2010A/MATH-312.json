Mathematics majors are advised that MATH 312 cannot be taken to satisfy the major requirements. Prerequisite: MATH 240.\r\n\r\nStudents expressed mixed opinions regarding this course. One student wrote that it was \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d However, another student complained that \u201cthe work and examples [were] just in abstract mathematical terms; there was virtually no application to real world problems.\u201d Another student stated that the textbook, was easy to read and informative.\r\n\r\nThe majority of students approved of Professor Virbhadra. The overwhelming sentiment was that Professor Virbhadra is \u201cdedicated\u201d to his students: he held 16 office hours per week and would go out of his way to make separate meetings with students if necessary. Many students felt that Professor Virbhadra \u201cgenuinely cares that everyone learn as much as possible.\u201d Another student wrote, \u201cI have never met someone so excited by teaching. His communication and accessibility were unmatched.\u201d While most students expressed similar views, one student stated \u201cI often found myself simply teaching myself from the book, and I know of many students who used MIT's linear algebra open course as a replacement for going to class.\u201d \r\n\r\nMany students thought this class was easy, especially \u201cafter coming from Math 241.\u201d One student stated that the material is taught slowly and is sometimes repeated.\r\n", "num_students": 79, "path": "/courses/26334/sections/001/reviews/4959-KUMAR-S--VIRBHADRA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4959-KUMAR-S--VIRBHADRA", "first_name": "KUMAR S.", "last_name": "VIRBHADRA", "id": "4959-KUMAR-S--VIRBHADRA", "name": "KUMAR S.
