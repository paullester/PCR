Concepts\r\nthat are covered include linear transformations, Gauss Jordan elimination, eigenvalues\r\nand eigenvectors, theory and applications.\r\nStudents, in general, seemed to enjoy the class and found it worthwhile. Most felt\r\nthat they learned a lot. One student remarked that the course is \u201cuseful in that concepts\r\nrelated to other courses\u201d he was taking.\r\nProfessor Yip received generally positive reviews. Students felt that as a new\r\nprofessor, she was \u201csurprisingly good\u201d at explaining concepts in a clear and concise\r\nmanner. Most students appreciated her willingness to talk about lecture material and\r\nproblems outside of class. The one major complaint centered on Professor Yip\u2019s\r\nreluctance to provide answers to practice exams.\r\nMost students taking this class are engineers looking to finish their math minors.\r\nThus, even though the class was not graded on a curve, it seemed quite competitive to\r\nmany students.", "num_students": 80, "path": "/courses/24696/sections/001/reviews/5782-MARTHA-YIP", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5782-MARTHA-YIP", "first_name": "MARTHA", "last_name": "YIP", "id": "5782-MARTHA-YIP", "name": "MARTHA YIP"}, "num_reviewers": 78, "id": "24696-001-5782-MARTHA-YIP"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "0.67", "rRecommendMajor": "1.33", "rCourseQuality": "1.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "1.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.33", "rCommAbility": "1.17", "rInstructorQuality": "1.50"}, "section": {"name": "LINEAR ALGEBRA", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MATH-312-002", "path": "/courses/24696/sections/002", "id": "24696-002", "aliases": ["MATH-312-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/24696/sections/002/reviews/759-CHING-LI-CHAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/759-CHING-LI-CHAI", "first_name": "CHING-LI", "last_name": "CHAI", "id": "759-CHING-LI-CHAI", "name": "CHING-LI CHAI"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "24696-002-759-CHING-LI-CHAI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.47", "rDifficulty": "2.53", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.07", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "LINEAR ALGEBRA", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "MATH-312-601", "path": "/courses/24696/sections/601", "id": "24696-601", "aliases": ["MATH-312-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/24696/sections/601/reviews/1561-TED-C--K--CHINBURG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1561-TED-C--K--CHINBURG", "first_name": "TED C.
