They found that he was always willing to answer any and all questions in and outside of class.  Professor Jankowski \u201cwent beyond what was discussed in the book and showed a wider applicability of the material discussed in class. \u201c His sense of humor was also appreciated by the students, with one saying it made the lectures of somewhat dry material more \u201cbearable.\u201d\r\n\r\nMath 104 assumes that students have taken AB Calculus or the equivalent.  Students who have not had AB Calculus or did poorly in AB Calculus should take MATH 103, which provides an introduction to calculus.  There is no prerequisite for this course. This course fulfills the Formal Reasoning requirement. Engineering students are encouraged to register for the 007 lecture and group 7 recitations.  In regards to the difficulty of the course, students said Professor Jankowski\u2019s tests were very \u201cdoable.\u201d They said Professor Jankowski is fair and not the type to deliberately give students a hard time with difficult problems.  In addition, students said that grading in this course was quite lenient.  Students are allowed to drop two of their lowest quizzes, and the tests that students do well on are given more weight in their final grade.  However, one student did recommend taking advantage of the outside tutoring system to ensure their success in this course.

His approach to the material is very clear to understand, and he keeps the subject matter interesting. Dr. Rimmer cares a lot about his students' success both in and out of the classroom.  His assessments and grading are both extremely fair.  His teaching style is a good pace for people who understand the reasoning behind the math formulas.  He makes a large lecture hall seem like a small classroom by addressing any questions a student has during class.
