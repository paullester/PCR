Furthermore, this course examines the use of symbolic manipulation and graphics software in calculus.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the content, one student felt that Math 104 is \u201ca very good math intro course. I only wish someone warned me before on how fast it was going to be. I have learned many of the subjects I began in high school more in depth, but because it was a very fast course I am not sure how well I learned them. Therefore i wish the course content could be split and spread into more courses.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor DeTurck\u2019s students emphasized his ability to clearly convey subject material in class. One student, who found the course to be quite difficult, mentioned that \u201cProfessor DeTurck helped the material become easier to understand.  The best thing to do in this class is to ask for and seek help.\u201d Another student simply stated: \u201cTake DeTurck for any math class, and you will not be sorry.\u201d A third, enthusiastic student believed that DeTurck \u201cis an amazing teacher, the absolute best for calculus I am sure, and I am confident that I understand the material far better than I ever have, and also far better than all the other sections of MATH 104.\u201d Another student exclaimed that \u201cProfessor DeTurck, despite his busy schedule, is extremely accessible. He is always coming in on Sundays to do review sessions, and his office hours are often like recitations. He is by far one of the best professors at Penn.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs far as the workload for the class, one student felt that it \u201cis relatively heavy, with one extensive homework assignment per week.\u201d Similarly, another student wrote that \u201cDeTurck gives a LOT of homework, but you end up understanding the topics really well.\u201d A third student believed that \u201cthe grading is incredibly fair, with plenty of partial credit given, and the exams are always straightforward.\u201d", "num_students": 156, "path": "/courses/13507/sections/006/reviews/1555-DENNIS-M--DETURCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1555-DENNIS-M--DETURCK", "first_name": "DENNIS M.", "last_name": "DETURCK", "id": "1555-DENNIS-M--DETURCK", "name": "DENNIS M.
