They praised his \u201cstraightforward,\u201d \u201cstructured,\u201d and \u201caccessible\u201d teaching methods, which made some of \u201cthe most complex parts of 104 seem simple and orderly.\u201d Professor van Erp was very accessible out of class during office hours. The only complaint out of twenty reviews was that \u201che missed several lectures, and was out of town for the last week before the final.\u201d Some students would have also preferred more theory taught in lectures. One person wrote, \u201cthe class was a great disappointment to me since there is no understanding of the mechanisms and only the use of a tool box.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile most learned a lot from the course, some reviewers (with less strong math backgrounds) thought that the course was too fast-paced. Homework, midterms and a final determined a student\u2019s final grade. Some students disliked the multiple-choice format on exams, \u201cwhen a small error costs you 10% of your grade.\u201d One student added, \u201cI feel as though the grades in this class do not reflect the amount of effort the students put into this course.\u201d Still, students strongly preferred this section of MATH104 over the other sections.\r\n\r\nMATH104 fulfills basic requirements in all four undergraduate schools.

One called it \u201cneedlessly dense,\u201d targeted more towards math majors rather than the usual crowd of students taking the class to fulfill requirements.\r\n\r\nWhile begrudging the fact that Professor Shaneson must be a \u201cbrilliant mathematician\u201d to have tenure, many students verbosely and vehemently declared him the \u201cworst professor I have ever had at Penn.\u201d Instead of introducing a concept from the basics, Professor Shaneson started with a difficult, long-winded problem. He would move too quickly and skip steps, finishing material far in advance of the syllabus, and would then \u201ctrail off into another subject in the middle of the class.\u201d Many wrote that they learned the material much better from the textbook or from the TA. On the other hand, some called him \u201centertaining,\u201d and helpful in \u201cone-on-one\u201d interactions.\r\n\r\nMATH104 fulfills basic requirements in all four undergraduate schools.

Some reported they \u201clearned absolutely nothing from the class\u201d and resorted to learning from tutors and the textbook instead. Many (up to two thirds of the class, by one reviewer\u2019s estimate) chose not to attend lecture at all. Students thought the class was difficult, saying that they needed to attend every lecture to stay on top of new material. One person wrote that there was not enough time to complete the exams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost reviewers criticized Professor Crotty\u2019s teaching ability. Lectures did not cover what was on the homework or text. Professor Crotty often went on tangents and much of what he taught was deemed irrelevant to the course material. One wrote that he \u201cdid not stimulate student interest\u201d. One positive reviewer, however, called Professor Crotty \u201cinvolved\u201d and \u201cpassionate\u201d, emailing students additional practice problems and painstakingly reviewing students\u2019 midterms to explain point deductions and grant partial credit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATH104 fulfills basic requirements in all four undergraduate schools.
