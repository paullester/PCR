It covers Linear Algebra, Higher Order Differential Equations, Linear Differential Equations, and a review of vectors. The course uses Zill Cullen's Advanced Engineering Mathematics as its textbook and consists of exams and homework sets. &#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents tended to like the material that was covered, although most would have preferred a more practical approach over the theoretical, proofs-based approach used.

Many students found him highly accessible outside of class during office hours. &#8232;\r\n\r\nAs a higher level mathematics course, this class consisted mainly of majors and minors in mathematics, engineering, and physics. Students found the material moderately difficult in that homework problems were much more difficult than those covered in lecture, and they required a certain amount of self-teaching. Exams were described as \u201ctoo easy,\u201d where most students performed well, making the curve extremely harsh. As such, students complained about exam grading, in which \u201ca stupid computational error had detrimental effects on overall performance,\u201d especially because there was a limited system of partial credit.
