The class also reviews and builds upon the vector calculus taught in Math 114: functions of several variables; vector fields; line and surface integrals; and Green\u2019s, Stokes\u2019, and divergence theorems. Other concepts covered are series of ordinary differential equations, Laplace transforms, and systems of ordinary differential equations. Math 114 or Calculus Part II is a pre-requisite.\r\n\r\nStudents felt they learned a lot, though material at times could be dense and complex. Most thought the material was useful; however, there were a number of criticisms concerning the organization of the curriculum. One student explained, \u201cAfter [an] incomplete look at linear algebra, we moved to the unrelated subject of differential equations, then onto an incomplete exploration of theorems of calculus, then back to differential equations.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, students praised Professor Blair\u2019s teaching abilities. Students described him as a \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cexemplary communicator.\u201d They also appreciated his patience and willingness to re-explain complex concepts. Some students did feel frustrated that the examples Professor Blair used, though relevant, were not nearly as difficult as the problems presented in quizzes and exams.\r\n\r\nMost students who took the class were underclassmen fulfilling engineering and physical science requirements. Workload was generally described as manageable. The majority of complaints centered on quizzes. Students felt that quizzes were not an accurate reflection of midterms. Moreover, many argued that the midterms were not difficult enough, which led to high averages. Students should expect to do well if they pay close attention to lecture material and consistently do practice problems.\r\n", "num_students": 173, "path": "/courses/21995/sections/002/reviews/5405-RYAN-C--BLAIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5405-RYAN-C--BLAIR", "first_name": "RYAN C.", "last_name": "BLAIR", "id": "5405-RYAN-C--BLAIR", "name": "RYAN C.
