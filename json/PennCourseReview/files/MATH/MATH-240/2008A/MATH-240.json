This course also incorporates the use of symbolic manipulation and graphics software. The required text is \u2018Advanced Engineering Mathematics\u2019 by Zill Cullen.\r\n\r\nStudents were very pleased with the quality of the MATH 240 course, claiming that they learned a lot from its contents. A significant amount of work was required but the readings were considered very valuable.\r\n\r\nProfessor Peter Storm\u2019s communication skills were well received. The students found his lectures to be \u201cprecise\u201d and his explanations \u201cmade complex and difficult material seem simple and easy\u201d. Professor Storm stimulated the students\u2019 interest by encouraging much class participation and being \u201cpersonable\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d. Many even regarded him as the \u201cbest Math teacher at Penn\u201d because of his accessibility and enthusiasm about his work. Indeed, his teaching style was believed to \u201cenable a 10-year old to understand this class\u201d.\r\n\r\nAlthough the course was challenging and required a significant amount of work, it was still highly recommended for majors and non-majors alike. The pre-requisite is Calculus II (Math 114) and MATH 240 is a requirement for the Mathematics major.
