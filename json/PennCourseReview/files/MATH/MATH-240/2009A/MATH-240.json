Students felt underprepared for exams compared to other sections and didn\u2019t think the assigned homework nor the recitations were particularly helpful in preparing for common exams.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kreiger\u2019s lectures tended to be fast-paced and hard to keep up with. One student wrote, \u201cProf. Krieger is too smart/fast and the pace of his lectures are neck-breaking.\u201d Another student cited poor communication skills as impeding lecture quality, and many felt lectures were \u201calmost pointless\u201d and \u201cworthless.\u201d Others found him \u201cunapproachable and unhelpful\u201d during office hours. One student evidenced poor teaching quality by the fact that this section\u2019s average on the common exam was 20 points lower than that of all sections combined. Although there were many complaints about Kreiger, one student said the quality of the TAs made it even worse.
