{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/720"}, "description": "Mathematics 480 will open with a review of the basics of real analysis (brief or extended background requires). The review will include: introduction of the real numbers through Dedekind cuts, continuity of real-valued functions on the real line; Cantor nested-interval principle, basic results for continuous functions, Maximum and Intermediate Value theorems, Heine-Borel Theorem, Uniform Continuity on closed intervals; metric spaces, convergence of sequences, Cauchy sequences, completeness, more general uniform continuity and intermediate value theorems; general topology, separation, compactness, product spaces, Tychonoff's Theorem. \n\nSpecial topics in analysis: Weierstrass Polynomial Approximation Theorem, Bernstein polynomials and simultaneous approxfunctions and derivatives, topics from divergent series, summation methods; r measure theory, the Lebesgue integral, Lp spaces, Holder, Minkowski, and and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities; basics of Functional Analysis, normed spaces, Banach spaces and Hilbert space, with examples (Lp spaces, continuous-functions spaces), Banach spaces and spectral theory, groups and Fourier transforms, Tauberian theorems; approximation theory, again, through the prism of functional analysis; extension of the polynomial approximation theorem (Stone-Weierstrass theorem), Muntz approximation theorem (by polynomials with preassigned powers), compact operators, the Spectral theorem, Stone's theorem (resprsentations of the additive group of real numbers); Peter-Weyl theory (represenations of compact groups). A selection from these topics as time and class preparation allow. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "TOPICS IN MODERN MATH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13529/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS IN MODERN MATH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MATH-480-401", "path": "/courses/13529/sections/401", "id": "13529-401", "aliases": ["MATH-480-401", "MATH-550-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/13529/sections/401/reviews/763-ALEXANDRE-A-KIRILLOV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/763-ALEXANDRE-A-KIRILLOV", "first_name": "ALEXANDRE A", "last_name": "KIRILLOV", "id": "763-ALEXANDRE-A-KIRILLOV", "name": "ALEXANDRE A KIRILLOV"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "13529-401-763-ALEXANDRE-A-KIRILLOV"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-480", "path": "/courses/13529", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13529/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN MODERN MATH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MATH-480-401", "path": "/courses/13529/sections/401", "id": "13529-401", "aliases": ["MATH-480-401", "MATH-550-401"]}]}, "id": 13529, "aliases": ["MATH-480", "MATH-550"]}
