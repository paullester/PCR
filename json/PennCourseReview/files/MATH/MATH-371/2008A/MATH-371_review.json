Material is taught from a variety of approaches, including theory, computation and examples. The main textbook for Spring 2008 was Topics in Algebra 2nd ed. Students may take Math 503 as an alternative, which is more advanced and theoretical in nature.\r\n\r\nStudents found the course challenging but \u201cthoroughly [enjoyable].\u201d Grades were determined by two midterms, a final and weekly problem sets. Although some students found the problem sets to be very time consuming, most found them relevant and useful to the course. \r\n\r\nStudents raved about Professor Harbater. Many students described him as the best professor they\u2019ve had, either within the Math department, at Penn in general or even simply \u201cever.\u201d Students also repeatedly used the words \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d and \u201cawesome\u201d in their reviews of him. One student commented that he has \u201ca knack for helping students understand material,\u201d while another lauded him for being \u201cpersonable and quick to identify what is needed for the class to succeed.\u201d", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/20466/sections/001/reviews/3362-DAVID-HARBATER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3362-DAVID-HARBATER", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "HARBATER", "id": "3362-DAVID-HARBATER", "name": "DAVID HARBATER"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "20466-001-3362-DAVID-HARBATER"}]
