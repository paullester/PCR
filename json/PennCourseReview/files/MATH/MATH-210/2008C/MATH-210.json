{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/709"}, "description": "This course counts as a regular elective for both the Mathematics Major and Minor. \n\nThis is an experimental course about mathematical reasoning and the media. Embedded in many stories one finds in the media are mathematical questions as well as implicit mathematical models for how the world behaves. We will discuss ways to recognize such questions and models, and how to think about them from a mathematical perspective. A key part of the course will be about what constitutes a mathematical proof, and what passes for proof in various media contexts. The course will cover a variety of topics in logic, probability and statistics as well as how these subjects can be used and abused. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "MATH IN AGE OF INFO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18929/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-210", "path": "/courses/18929", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18929/sections", "values": [{"name": "MATH IN AGE OF INFO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-210-001", "path": "/courses/18929/sections/001", "id": "18929-001", "aliases": ["MATH-210-001"]}]}, "id": 18929, "aliases": ["MATH-210"]}
