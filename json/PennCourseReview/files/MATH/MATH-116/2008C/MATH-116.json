{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4603"}, "description": "Students who are interested in math or science might also want to consider a more challenging Honors version of Calculus II and III, Math 116 and Math 260 (the analogues of Math 114 and Math 240, respectively). These courses will cover essentially the same material as 114 and 240, but more in depth and involve discussion of the underlying theory as well as computations. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "HONORS CALCULUS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18924/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.69", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.76", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.76", "rWorkRequired": "3.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.59", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.24", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.93"}, "section": {"name": "HONORS CALCULUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-116-001", "path": "/courses/18924/sections/001", "id": "18924-001", "aliases": ["MATH-116-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/18924/sections/001/reviews/3362-DAVID-HARBATER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3362-DAVID-HARBATER", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "HARBATER", "id": "3362-DAVID-HARBATER", "name": "DAVID HARBATER"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "18924-001-3362-DAVID-HARBATER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-116", "path": "/courses/18924", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18924/sections", "values": [{"name": "HONORS CALCULUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-116-001", "path": "/courses/18924/sections/001", "id": "18924-001", "aliases": ["MATH-116-001"]}]}, "id": 18924, "aliases": ["MATH-116"]}
