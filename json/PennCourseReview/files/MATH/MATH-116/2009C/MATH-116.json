It covers material similar to MATH114, but with greater depth, including a review of the foundations of calculus, vector algebra and its applications, the calculus of vector-valued functions, ordinary differential equations, and linear algebra (linear spaces, inner product spaces, linear transformations and matrices).\r\n\r\nMost students heaped high praise on the course material, calling it \u201cvery interesting,\u201d \u201cabsolutely amazing,\u201d and a \u201cfantastic course.\u201d Most students liked the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d depth of the material, although some said it was a little \u201ctoo abstract.\u201d One wrote, \u201cI would recommend this course to anyone who wants a challenge beyond the usual plug-and-chug math classes.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Harbater was universally named \u201can amazing instructor,\u201d and more than one student said that he was the \u201cbest math teacher\u201d they\u2019d ever had. Professor Harbater \u201cinspires a passion for mathematics,\u201d while being \u201cvery knowledgeable\u201d about the subject.

The class is intended for those who are interested in mathematics or science, but may be \u201ctoo abstract\u201d for those who do not intend to major in mathematics or a related subject. Students overall noted the difficulty of MATH116.
