These courses will cover essentially the same material as 114 and 240, but more in depth and involve discussion of the underlying theory as well as computations. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "HONORS CALCULUS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29215/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.38", "rTAQuality": "3.35", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "HONORS CALCULUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-116-001", "path": "/courses/29215/sections/001", "id": "29215-001", "aliases": ["MATH-116-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/29215/sections/001/reviews/5783-BRIAN-WEBER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5783-BRIAN-WEBER", "first_name": "BRIAN", "last_name": "WEBER", "id": "5783-BRIAN-WEBER", "name": "BRIAN WEBER"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "29215-001-5783-BRIAN-WEBER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-116", "path": "/courses/29215", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29215/sections", "values": [{"name": "HONORS CALCULUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-116-001", "path": "/courses/29215/sections/001", "id": "29215-001", "aliases": ["MATH-116-001"]}]}, "id": 29215, "aliases": ["MATH-116"]}
