It covers material similar to MATH114, but with greater depth,\r\nincluding a review of the foundations of calculus, vector algebra and its applications, the\r\ncalculus of vector-valued functions, ordinary differential equations, and linear algebra\r\n(linear spaces, inner product spaces, linear transformations and matrices).\r\nStudents raved about Professor Nicoara\u2019s course, calling it \u201cvaluable,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d\r\nand \u201cmathematically enlightening.\u201d Students felt that they learned a great deal from the\r\ncourse and found that the hard work it required \u201creally paid off.\u201d\r\nStudents heaped praise on Professor Nicoara, calling her \u201centhusiastic\u201d,\r\n\u201cknowledgeable\u201d and a \u201cspectacular professor.\u201d They also found her to be \u201cfull of life\u201d\r\nand \u201cengaging,\u201d with a few students claiming that she is the \u201cbest teacher\u201d they have ever\r\nhad.\r\nStudents unanimously agreed that Professor Nicoara\u2019s course is \u201cvaluable to any\r\nstudent considering mathematics or physics\u201d and is a \u201cgreat introduction to true\r\nmathematics.\u201d One student pointed out that the class might be \u201cdifficult if you\u2019ve had no\r\nprior experience in proof-writing\u201d but that the professor and TA do a good job bringing\r\neveryone up to speed.
