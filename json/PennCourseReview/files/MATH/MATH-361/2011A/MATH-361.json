MATH 508-509 is a masters level version of this course.\r\n\r\nStudents found the class challenging yet approachable. One student said it was the best math class he had ever taken at Penn.\r\n\r\nStudents said the professor was very clear in concepts, communication and writing. Her lectures were clear and easily understandable.\r\n\r\nStudents said the exams and problem sets were almost always straightforward and fair.\r\n", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/22002/sections/001/reviews/5407-ZHE-LIU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5407-ZHE-LIU", "first_name": "ZHE", "last_name": "LIU", "id": "5407-ZHE-LIU", "name": "ZHE LIU"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "22002-001-5407-ZHE-LIU"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-361", "path": "/courses/22002", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22002/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED CALCULUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-361-001", "path": "/courses/22002/sections/001", "id": "22002-001", "aliases": ["MATH-361-001"]}]}, "id": 22002, "aliases": ["MATH-361"]}
