In addition, it offers an introduction to complex analysis. It\r\nuses symbolic manipulation and graphics software.\r\nStudents found that the course starts off relatively easy with complex analysis and\r\ngets progressively much harder going to Fourier series and PDE's. The rate at which the\r\ndifficulty increases is almost shocking. Professor Lu communicates the material fine, but\r\nthe order in which he works on the blackboard is usually difficult to follow. The exam\r\nformat is good with both multiple choice and open-ended problems. However, the\r\nmultiple-choice questions are far more difficult than the open-ended questions or\r\nhomework problems.\r\nMany students said that Professor Lu seemed more interested in getting through\r\nthe material than in actually having his students understand it. His lectures were nicely\r\nstructured and he was good at describing his thought process and what steps he was\r\ndoing. However, he only went through proofs in his lectures and never did examples; the\r\nproofs being completely unnecessary for completing the homework and test problems. He\r\nwas reluctant to answer questions and do examples in class, rendering the lecture\r\ncompletely useless if you didn't understand what he was teaching, which the majority of\r\nthe class didn't.
