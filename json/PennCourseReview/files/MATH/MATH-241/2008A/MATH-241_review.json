Students described Rimmer as very capable of teaching and highly motivated. Although some thought that Rimmer\u2019s lecture slides were not detailed, many felt that Rimmer was very organized. Professor Rimmer was also very helpful and willing to discuss coursework with students after class and during office hours.", "num_students": 68, "path": "/courses/20459/sections/002/reviews/4008-NAKIA-ANTHONY-RIMMER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4008-NAKIA-ANTHONY-RIMMER", "first_name": "NAKIA ANTHONY", "last_name": "RIMMER", "id": "4008-NAKIA-ANTHONY-RIMMER", "name": "NAKIA ANTHONY RIMMER"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "20459-002-4008-NAKIA-ANTHONY-RIMMER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "3.30", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.65", "rWorkRequired": "2.84", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.30", "rCommAbility": "2.97", "rInstructorQuality": "3.16"}, "section": {"name": "CALCULUS IV", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "MATH-241-003", "path": "/courses/20459/sections/003", "id": "20459-003", "aliases": ["MATH-241-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/20459/sections/003/reviews/1569-CHARLES-L--EPSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1569-CHARLES-L--EPSTEIN", "first_name": "CHARLES L.", "last_name": "EPSTEIN", "id": "1569-CHARLES-L--EPSTEIN", "name": "CHARLES L.
