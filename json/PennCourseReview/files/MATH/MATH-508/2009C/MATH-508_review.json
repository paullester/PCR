This course teaches students how to read and construct rigorous formal proofs. The elements of elementary calculus are revisited from a theoretical perspective. Topics covered include the construction of the real number, the topology of the real line, and the foundations of single-variable calculus; notions of convergence for sequences of functions; and basic approximation theorems for continuous functions and rigorous treatment of elementary transcendental functions. This is the first course in the two-semester analysis sequence.\r\n\r\nMost students did not enjoy MATH508, saying that it was an \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cfrustrating\u201d course. Students complained that it did not match the course description. One student commented, \u201cThis was supposed to be a Real Analysis course, and the phrase \u2018Real Analysis\u2019 didn't even come up until the next-to-last week of class.\u201d Others felt the pace of the class was too slow. On the other hand, one reviewer said the class was great.\r\n\r\nMany students expressed disappointment with Professor Kadison. They felt he taught too slowly, overlooked the more advanced background of the students enrolled, and didn\u2019t challenged them enough. They also felt his \u201cinformal\u201d lecture style was inappropriate for the \u201crigor\u201d of the course content, adding that lectures were often filled with anecdotes irrelevant to the course material. In addition, some students took offense at Professor Kadison\u2019s attitude when he \u201cbecame very smug\u201d and told certain students not to take the next course in the sequence. However, a few students appreciated Professor Kadison\u2019s approach, with one student commenting that \u201cProfessor Kadison has taught me how to think like a good mathematician.\u201d\r\n\r\nMATH508 is a course taken almost exclusively by mathematics majors. MATH240/241 is a prerequisite, and completion of a freshman seminar (MATH202/203) is recommended. One student complained, \u201cExams were based on rote regurgitation of definitions in the notes, or proofs already demonstrated in class; grading on the exam was arbitrary. The course grading rubric was about as arbitrary, with 25% attendance and 25% \u2018decorum\u2019\u201d. The same student compared the difficulty of the class to a 100- or 200- level class. Another reviewer grumbled that \u201cThe final grade was 50% participation,\u201d while \u201cthe rest of the grade was composed of three homework assignments and one midterm.\u201d Yet another student wrote, \u201cProfessor Kadison repeatedly changed the grading structure for the course, which ultimately ruined a number of students grades at the end of the semester.\u201d", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/17658/sections/001/reviews/3363-RICHARD-V--KADISON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3363-RICHARD-V--KADISON", "first_name": "RICHARD V.", "last_name": "KADISON", "id": "3363-RICHARD-V--KADISON", "name": "RICHARD V.
