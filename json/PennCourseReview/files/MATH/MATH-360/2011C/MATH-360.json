MATH 508-509 is a masters level version of this course.\r\nStudents described this class as fast moving but very informative. Students\r\ndescribed that after the course they were able to develop their thoughts better as well as\r\nbeing able to better think logically. Students felt that the assignments were manageable,\r\nbut still difficult.\r\nOverall students seemed to enjoy Professor Cooper. He was described as being\r\nable to communicate well and share his love of mathematics. Students wished that he\r\nwould post all the answers to his problem sets online as those were very helpful.\r\nWhile this class was enjoyed by many students, it was also described as difficult.\r\nOne student stated that he spent 12-20 hours per week on homework assignments alone\r\nas well as most of his Thanksgiving Break working on problem sets. Regardless,\r\nstudents said that the work was worth the effort and recommended this class to other\r\nstudents looking to learn more about higher level mathematics.", "num_students": 44, "path": "/courses/24700/sections/001/reviews/5779-ANDREW-COOPER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5779-ANDREW-COOPER", "first_name": "ANDREW", "last_name": "COOPER", "id": "5779-ANDREW-COOPER", "name": "ANDREW COOPER"}, "num_reviewers": 39, "id": "24700-001-5779-ANDREW-COOPER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-360", "path": "/courses/24700", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24700/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED CALCULUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-360-001", "path": "/courses/24700/sections/001", "id": "24700-001", "aliases": ["MATH-360-001"]}]}, "id": 24700, "aliases": ["MATH-360"]}
