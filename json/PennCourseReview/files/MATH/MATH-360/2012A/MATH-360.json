Several students remarked that Professor Le was \u201cvery clear,\u201d while several others noted Professor Le\u2019s accessibility and willingness to help during office hours. A number of students noted that Professor Le\u2019s writing was sometimes \u201ctoo messy\u201d and that the professor erased things from the board too quickly. Students praised the lecture notes Professor Le posted online, with one student remarking that they were \u201cbetter than any textbook.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe workload of this course was widely considered to be very challenging.
