{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3442"}, "description": "This course focuses on the creative side of mathematics, with an emphasis on discovery, reasoning, proofs and effective communication, while at the same time studying real and complex numbers, sequences, series, continuity, differentiability and integrability. Small class sizes permit an informal, discussion-type atmosphere, and often the entire class works together on a given problem. Homework is intended to be thought-provoking, rather than skill-sharpening. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "PROVING THINGS: ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9180/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "3.18", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "3.24", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.65", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "PROVING THINGS: ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-202-001", "path": "/courses/9180/sections/001", "id": "9180-001", "aliases": ["MATH-202-001"]}, "comments": "Students almost uniformly call Gluck a \u201cgreat\u201d professor, using several superlatives to describe his abilities.
