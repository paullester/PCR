Such areas are set in the context of contemporary applications in science and society such as game theory.\r\n\r\nMost students felt this course was \u201cneither interesting nor stimulating.\u201d One student even described it as \u201ctotally worthless,\u201d while another proposed that it should be dropped from Penn\u2019s curriculum or turned into a small seminar that would enable meaningful discussion and enhance learning. A majority of students felt misled by the course description and purpose, resulting in frustration with the content, grading and class format. Many seemed to think that this semester was largely uncharacteristic of years past and were duly disappointed as the semester progressed.\r\n\r\nMany students were also frustrated by grading of homework assignments and found the work required tedious and overly time-consuming. Exams were challenging, and several students felt the second midterm was unfairly difficult. One student noted, \u201cUnlike many of my classmates, I attended all the lectures, but I feel like it did not help me to prepare for the graded coursework.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents were also discontented with Professor Gressman\u2019s teaching style, which they described as \u201cboring,\u201d \u201cslow\u201d and sometimes \u201crepetitive.\u201d One student wrote, \u201cReading verbatim from the slides is not stimulating.\u201d However, many appreciated Professor Gressman\u2019s passion for the subject and approachability during office hours. As one student noted, \u201cProfessor Gressman clearly loves the material and wants us to learn it well.\u201d Others appreciated Gressman\u2019s clarity and the quality of his lecture notes which helped them prepare for exams.\r\n\r\nStudents who took this course were not math majors and did not necessarily have a strong background or interest in mathematics. This course fulfills Natural Science and Mathematics sector requirement for the College. Given their background with the subject matter and the difficulty of the course, many students struggled to obtain their desired grade.", "num_students": 111, "path": "/courses/16028/sections/001/reviews/4410-PHILIP-T--GRESSMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4410-PHILIP-T--GRESSMAN", "first_name": "PHILIP T.", "last_name": "GRESSMAN", "id": "4410-PHILIP-T--GRESSMAN", "name": "PHILIP T.
