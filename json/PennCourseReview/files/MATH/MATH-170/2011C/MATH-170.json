A few students reported particularly liking the \u201cpractical applications\u201d\r\nof the math concepts they were learning.

Professor\r\nLiu \u201cclearly communicated the expectations of the course,\u201d and students knew where\r\nthey stood in the class, with respect to grades, at all times. She was also described as\r\n\u201ckind\u201d and as a teacher who really cares about her students and the subject.\r\nThis course satisfies the Natural Science & Mathematics Sector requirement, and it\r\nmay also be counted toward the General Requirement in Natural Science & Mathematics.\r\nStudents described this course as being easy, and one even noted being \u201camazed that I get\r\ncollege credit for this class.\u201d Students, many of whom were \u201cnot mathematically\r\ninclined,\u201d generally took this course to fulfill their sector requirement, and they found it\r\nto be a very enjoyable way to do so.
