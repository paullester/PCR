Students agreed that the course \u201cneeds some adjustment\u201d especially since \u201cclass time was not used effectively.\u201d On the other hand, students found the time spent at local high schools very rewarding, albeit still disorganized.  One student commented, \u201cI had a great time with the students at the high school.  I loved engaging them and working with them weekly.\u201d  That same student noted, though, that they did not meet with the students an adequate number of times.\r\n\r\n\tStudents did not feel that Professor Stovall was a very useful or involved professor.  Students noted, \u201cThe teacher barely showed up or taught.\u201d  Additionally, students described Professor Stovall as \u201cnot effectively using Penn\u2019s resources in the schools.\u201d  All in all, students felt that \u201cDr. Stovall means well and has good intentions,\u201d but the class needs to be \u201cmore coordinated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tStudents felt this course would be extremely easy for anyone at Penn.  One student stated, \u201cIf you are looking for an easy class to just go by, you should take it.   But this is not a class that will cover issues of education.\u201d  This is an Academically Based Community Service course.
