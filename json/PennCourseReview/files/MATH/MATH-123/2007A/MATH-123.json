{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/700"}, "description": "This course allows Penn students to teach a series of hands-on activities to students in math classes at University City High School. The semester starts with an introduction to successful approaches for teaching math in urban high schools. The rest of the semester will be devoted to a series of weekly hands-on activities designed to teach fundamental aspects of geometry. The first class meeting of each week, Penn faculty teach Penn students the relevant mathematical background and techniques for a hands-on activity. During the second session of each week, Penn students will teach the hands-on activity to a small group of UCHS students. The Penn students will also have an opportunity to develop their own activity and to implement it with the UCHS students. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "COMMUNITY MATH TEACH PRO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14768/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.17", "rDifficulty": "0.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.32", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "1.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.41", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.45", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "COMMUNITY MATH TEACH PRO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-123-001", "path": "/courses/14768/sections/001", "id": "14768-001", "aliases": ["MATH-123-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/14768/sections/001/reviews/1556-IDRIS-STOVALL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1556-IDRIS-STOVALL", "first_name": "IDRIS", "last_name": "STOVALL", "id": "1556-IDRIS-STOVALL", "name": "IDRIS STOVALL"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "14768-001-1556-IDRIS-STOVALL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-123", "path": "/courses/14768", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14768/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMMUNITY MATH TEACH PRO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-123-001", "path": "/courses/14768/sections/001", "id": "14768-001", "aliases": ["MATH-123-001"]}]}, "id": 14768, "aliases": ["MATH-123"]}
