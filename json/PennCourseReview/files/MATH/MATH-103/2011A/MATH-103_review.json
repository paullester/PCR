Polynomial and elementary transcendental functions and their applications, derivatives, extremum problems, curve-sketching, approximations, integrals, and the fundamental theorem of calculus were covered topics. This class fulfills the Formal Reasoning requirement.\r\n\r\nStudents said the class was great but difficult.\r\n\r\nThey found Professor Clee fantastic at explaining the content and providing the contexts for how it would be used in the real world. They found him remarkably talented in explaining difficult concepts.\r\n\r\nStudents did not comment on the exams or grades, but said that it was a tough class that was made approachable.\r\n", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/21987/sections/601/reviews/743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE", "first_name": "WILLIAM A", "last_name": "CLEE", "id": "743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE", "name": "WILLIAM A CLEE"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "21987-601-743-WILLIAM-A-CLEE"}]
