One student said the class was interesting, although admitted that \u201cas a core class for the math major, I expected more.\u201d Many students complained that the pace was very fast and that homework assignments were often confusing and cumbersome, taking on average 10 to 20 hours per week. Another student wrote that \u201cthe course is structured around lots of little findings instead of a few major theorems.\u201d This made it difficult for some to synthesize the material from week to week and increased the amount of work required, especially because lectures did not follow the textbook. One student wrote the despite feeling lost the first half of the semester, \u201cthe material gets easier as you go along.\u201d Many students emphasized the helpfulness of the TA and the recitations.\r\n\r\nStudents gave mixed reviews for Professor Chai. Many agreed that he was extremely knowledgeable, although many expressed difficulty following his lectures and desired greater organization and structure. Some felt he did not communicate the material clearly enough or to a level appropriate for the course.", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/17649/sections/001/reviews/759-CHING-LI-CHAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/759-CHING-LI-CHAI", "first_name": "CHING-LI", "last_name": "CHAI", "id": "759-CHING-LI-CHAI", "name": "CHING-LI CHAI"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "17649-001-759-CHING-LI-CHAI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-370", "path": "/courses/17649", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17649/sections", "values": [{"name": "ALGEBRA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-370-001", "path": "/courses/17649/sections/001", "id": "17649-001", "aliases": ["MATH-370-001"]}]}, "id": 17649, "aliases": ["MATH-370"]}
