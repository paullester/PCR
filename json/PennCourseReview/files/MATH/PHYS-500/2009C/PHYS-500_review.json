Topics include complex analysis, Fourier series and transforms, ordinary and partial equations, and Hilbert spaces.\r\n\r\nThis course was consistently described by students as \u201cexcellent.\u201d After taking this course, students felt well-equipped to manipulate a broad range of mathematical tools useful in solving physics problems. A couple of students would have liked \u201ca little more detail\u201d about the subjects covered, and some students felt that certain topics were slightly redundant in that they had learned them before in other classes.\r\n\r\nPraise for Professor Trodden was endless. Students unanimously agreed that Professor Trodden\u2019s lectures were \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cconcise,\u201d and \u201corganized,\u201d as well as \u201cilluminating,\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d Students felt that Professor Trodden was \u201cgenuinely committed\u201d to helping them understand the material both during and outside of class, and they felt comfortable asking questions, which were encouraged. Students also appreciated that Professor Trodden provided all students would need to know, making few references to outside sources and placing \u201cfew demands\u201d on prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nProfess Trodden\u2019s homework assignments were typically considered \u201cinteresting and clever,\u201d as well as \u201ceffective in enforcing material,\u201d although difficulty and length of problem sets steadily declined as the semester progressed. A complaint that came up was that there were not enough assigned homework problems, especially toward the end of the semester, which would\u2019ve been helpful in studying for exams.", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/17931/sections/401/reviews/4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "first_name": "MARK", "last_name": "TRODDEN", "id": "4960-MARK-TRODDEN", "name": "MARK TRODDEN"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "17931-401-4960-MARK-TRODDEN"}]
