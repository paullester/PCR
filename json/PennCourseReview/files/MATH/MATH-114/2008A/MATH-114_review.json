This course works with the textbook Calculus by Stewart. \r\n\r\nMost students were very pleased with van Erp\u2019s rendering of this course. Students found the material challenging and did not recommend it for non-majors. Grading was determined by performance on weekly homework assignments, midterms and a comprehensive final exam. All tests were multiple choice (no partial credit).\r\n\r\nStudents were extremely satisfied with Professor van Erp.
