{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1979"}, "description": "This course focuses on problems from Algebra (especially linear algebra and multilinear algebra) and Analysis (especially multivariable calculus through vector fields, multiple integrals and Stokes theorem). The material is presented through student solving of problems. In addition there will be a selection of advanced topics which will be accessible via this material. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "GRAD PROSEMINAR IN MATH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18946/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "1.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "GRAD PROSEMINAR IN MATH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-504-001", "path": "/courses/18946/sections/001", "id": "18946-001", "aliases": ["MATH-504-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/18946/sections/001/reviews/747-MURRAY-GERSTENHABER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/747-MURRAY-GERSTENHABER", "first_name": "MURRAY", "last_name": "GERSTENHABER", "id": "747-MURRAY-GERSTENHABER", "name": "MURRAY GERSTENHABER"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "18946-001-747-MURRAY-GERSTENHABER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MATH-504", "path": "/courses/18946", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18946/sections", "values": [{"name": "GRAD PROSEMINAR IN MATH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MATH-504-001", "path": "/courses/18946/sections/001", "id": "18946-001", "aliases": ["MATH-504-001"]}]}, "id": 18946, "aliases": ["MATH-504"]}
