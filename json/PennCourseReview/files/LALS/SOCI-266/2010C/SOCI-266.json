{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5166"}, "description": "This course presents a broad overview of the Latino population in the United States that focuses on the economic and sociological aspects of Latino immigration and assimilation. Topics to be covered include: construction of Latino identity, the history of U.S. Latino immigration, Latino family patterns and household structure, Latino educational attainment. Latino incorporation into the U.S. labor force, earnings and economic well-being among Latino-origin groups, assimilation and the second generation. The course will stress the importance of understanding Latinos within the overall system of race and ethnic relations in the U.S., as well as in comparison with previous immigration flows, particularly from Europe. We will pay particular attention to the economic impact of Latio immigration on both the U.S. receiving and Latin American sending communities, and the efficacy and future possililities of U.S. immigration policy. Within all of these diverse topics, we will stress the heterogeneity of the Latino population according to national origin groups (i.e. Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Latinos), as well as generational differences between immigrants and the native born. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "LATINOS IN UNITED STATES: Latinos in the United States", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23797/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.32", "rDifficulty": "2.44", "rStimulateInterest": "3.32", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.21", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.06", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "LATINOS IN UNITED STATES: Latinos in the United States", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-266-401", "path": "/courses/23797/sections/401", "id": "23797-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-266-401", "LALS-235-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/23797/sections/401/reviews/4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO", "first_name": "EMILIO ALBERTO", "last_name": "PARRADO", "id": "4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO", "name": "EMILIO ALBERTO PARRADO"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "23797-401-4564-EMILIO-ALBERTO-PARRADO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-266", "path": "/courses/23797", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23797/sections", "values": [{"name": "LATINOS IN UNITED STATES: Latinos in the United States", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-266-401", "path": "/courses/23797/sections/401", "id": "23797-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-266-401", "LALS-235-401"]}]}, "id": 23797, "aliases": ["SOCI-266", "LALS-235"]}
