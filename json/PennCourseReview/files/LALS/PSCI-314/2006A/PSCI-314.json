{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3226"}, "description": "This seminar is open to advanced undergraduates and graduate students. We will review and analyze the theoretical literatures on regime change and compare the experiences of countries emerging from bureaucratic authoritarianism, military rule, and socialism. How do previous regimes and economic systems, political culture, social structure and socio-economic development, and international pressures affect attempts to build democratic institutions? We will employ concepts drawn from comparative and theoretical writings to investigate cases of regime change in Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as Latin America and other areas of the developing world. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8270/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.25", "rRecommendMajor": "2.92", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.08", "rReadingsValue": "2.42", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.17", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-314-401", "path": "/courses/8270/sections/401", "id": "8270-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-314-401", "LALS-314-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/8270/sections/401/reviews/2662-TULIA-G--FALLETI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2662-TULIA-G--FALLETI", "first_name": "TULIA G.", "last_name": "FALLETI", "id": "2662-TULIA-G--FALLETI", "name": "TULIA G.
