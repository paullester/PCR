{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1455"}, "description": "This course examines the dynamics of political and economic change in twentieth century Latin America, with the goal of achieving an understanding of contemporary politics in the region. We will analyze topics such as the incorporation of the region to the international economy and the consolidation of oligarchic states (1880s to 1930s), corporatism, populism, and elict pacts (1930s and 1940s), social revolution, democratic breakdown, and military rule (1960s and 1970s), transitions to democracy and human rights advocacy (1980s), makret-oriented reforms (1990s), and the turn to the left of current governments (2000s). The course will draw primarily from the experiences of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. No prior knowledge of the region is required. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10899/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.97", "rDifficulty": "2.92", "rStimulateInterest": "2.39", "rRecommendMajor": "2.92", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.31", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "2.61", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-213-401", "path": "/courses/10899/sections/401", "id": "10899-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-213-401", "LTAM-213-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/10899/sections/401/reviews/2662-TULIA-G--FALLETI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2662-TULIA-G--FALLETI", "first_name": "TULIA G.", "last_name": "FALLETI", "id": "2662-TULIA-G--FALLETI", "name": "TULIA G.
