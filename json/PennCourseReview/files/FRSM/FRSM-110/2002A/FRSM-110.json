{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/515"}, "description": "Why do buildings by different architects look so different? The Getty Museum in Los Angeles, for example, is quite different from the Bilbao Guggenheim; Rem koolhas' proposed library in Seattle is world's apart from Tom Beeby's Harold T. Washington Library in Chicago. In addition to site, function, and construction, architecture is affected by style, and today there are many different stylistic approaches. Style is neglected in most discussions of architecture yet it is central to the design and appreciation of buildings. The seminar will examine the role that style plays in the work of prominent contemporary architects (e.g. Frank Gehry, Robert Venturi, Robert A., M. Stern, Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel) both in the United States and abroad. Selected readings will form the basis for written assignments that will include two 5-page papers and one 10-page term paper. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "ARCHITECTURE TODAY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/515/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "1.86", "rRecommendMajor": "2.71", "rCourseQuality": "2.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.07", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "ARCHITECTURE TODAY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FRSM-110-301", "path": "/courses/515/sections/301", "id": "515-301", "aliases": ["FRSM-110-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/515/sections/301/reviews/122-WITOLD-M-RYBCZYNSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/122-WITOLD-M-RYBCZYNSKI", "first_name": "WITOLD M", "last_name": "RYBCZYNSKI", "id": "122-WITOLD-M-RYBCZYNSKI", "name": "WITOLD M RYBCZYNSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "515-301-122-WITOLD-M-RYBCZYNSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FRSM-110", "path": "/courses/515", "sections": {"path": "/courses/515/sections", "values": [{"name": "ARCHITECTURE TODAY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FRSM-110-301", "path": "/courses/515/sections/301", "id": "515-301", "aliases": ["FRSM-110-301"]}]}, "id": 515, "aliases": ["FRSM-110"]}
