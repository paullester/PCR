Drawing on readings from literature, philosophy and the social sciences, this course will examine the meaning of integrity and the reasons underlying its centrality and elusiveness. We will also consider the ways in which it may come to play a defining role in decision making, both in our personal lives as students, teachers, and citizens and in the ethics of such professions as business, education, law and medicine. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTEGRITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13309/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.89", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.42", "rRecommendMajor": "2.74", "rCourseQuality": "2.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.74", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "INTEGRITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FRSM-128-301", "path": "/courses/13309/sections/301", "id": "13309-301", "aliases": ["FRSM-128-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/13309/sections/301/reviews/1465-JOAN-F-GOODMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1465-JOAN-F-GOODMAN", "first_name": "JOAN F", "last_name": "GOODMAN", "id": "1465-JOAN-F-GOODMAN", "name": "JOAN F GOODMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "13309-301-1465-JOAN-F-GOODMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "FRSM-128", "path": "/courses/13309", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13309/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEGRITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "FRSM-128-301", "path": "/courses/13309/sections/301", "id": "13309-301", "aliases": ["FRSM-128-301"]}]}, "id": 13309, "aliases": ["FRSM-128"]}
