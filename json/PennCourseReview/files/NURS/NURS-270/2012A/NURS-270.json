The clinical application takes place in an acute care setting and emphasizes transitional care for older adults across the health care continuum.\r\n\tThis course covers many topics in a short amount of time, something that was seen as a positive by some students and as a negative by others.  On the plus side, this class left students with a lot of new information, and some wished that there \u201cwas a way to increase the time for this class to more than half a semester.\u201d  On the other hand, others viewed this large amount of material to be responsible for stifling flexibility for the course and for creating an unnecessary sense of pressure.  Regardless, all students reported learning a great deal and considering this course \u201cessential to one\u2019s nursing career.\u201d\r\n\tDr. Massimo was viewed as \u201cextremely helpful and approachable,\u201d and the majority of students enjoyed the lectures and simulations provided in class.  \r\n\tReviews revealed that the tests were not seen as favorable among students; exams did not accurately reflect students\u2019 knowledge of the course and did not correlate with the in-class powerpoints.  No specific comments were given in regards to grading or the workload.
