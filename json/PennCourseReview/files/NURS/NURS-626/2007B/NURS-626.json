{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2033"}, "description": "This course presents Bowen Family Systems Theory as it applies to families over the life and organizations over time. This is a theoretical course whose purpose is to provide the student with a broad, systemic perspective on human functioning. The course begins with a detailed presentation of Systems Theory, from both a family and organizational perspective. As presented there is a continual compare and contrast to other dominant theories of human functioning. It then applies the concepts of Systems Theory to the understanding and assessment of the stages of the normal family life cycle from a multi-generational, multi-cultural perspective. This is followed by discussions of the theory's application to the emotional problems of children, adolescents, adults and their families. Likewise, application to organizational behavior is made, including health care organizations. Relevant research is discussed throughout. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "FAMILY AND ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12704/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.83", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "FAMILY AND ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "NURS-626-910", "path": "/courses/12704/sections/910", "id": "12704-910", "aliases": ["NURS-626-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/12704/sections/910/reviews/1647-JOANNE-M-GILLIS-DONOVAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1647-JOANNE-M-GILLIS-DONOVAN", "first_name": "JOANNE M", "last_name": "GILLIS-DONOVAN", "id": "1647-JOANNE-M-GILLIS-DONOVAN", "name": "JOANNE M GILLIS-DONOVAN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "12704-910-1647-JOANNE-M-GILLIS-DONOVAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-626", "path": "/courses/12704", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12704/sections", "values": [{"name": "FAMILY AND ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "NURS-626-910", "path": "/courses/12704/sections/910", "id": "12704-910", "aliases": ["NURS-626-910"]}]}, "id": 12704, "aliases": ["NURS-626"]}
