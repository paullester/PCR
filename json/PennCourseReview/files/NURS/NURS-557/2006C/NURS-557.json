Students focus on the care of persons with life-threatening, progressive illness, emphasizing respect for patients' and families' beliefs, values, and choices. Students also explore psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of palliative care. Historical, sociocultural, economic, legal, and ethical trends in palliative care are discussed. Factors affecting health care systems and societal attitudes are considered in evaluating the delivery of care during advanced illness and at the end of life. Students engage in the critical analysis of literature, research, and observational experiences concerning biopsychosocial needs of patients and families. Students acquire competencies in patient/family assessment, communication, decision-making, and interdisciplinary collaboration in palliative care. \n\nThis course satisfies the Society & Social Structures Sector for Nursing Class of 2012 and Beyond. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "ADVANCED ILLNESS, DYING AND DEATH: PSYCHOSOCIAL AND POLICY PERSPECTIVES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9326/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.05", "rDifficulty": "2.37", "rStimulateInterest": "3.42", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.16", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "3.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.47", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED ILLNESS, DYING AND DEATH: PSYCHOSOCIAL AND POLICY PERSPECTIVES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-557-401", "path": "/courses/9326/sections/401", "id": "9326-401", "aliases": ["NURS-557-401", "NURS-367-401"]}, "comments": "Students in this class had overwhelmingly positive comments about Dr. Reifsnyder.
