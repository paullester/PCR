{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/830"}, "description": "The relationships among nursing theory, research and practice will be examined. An emphasis will be placed on research competencies for advanced practice nurses (APNs), including understanding nursing research methods and strategies in order to evaluate research results for applicability to practice and to design projects for evaluating outcomes of practice. An understanding of statistical techniques will be integrated into the course and build on the required undergraduate statistics course. Published nursing research studies will be evaluated for scientific merit and clinical feasibility, with a focus on evidence-based practice. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH METHODS AND DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30766/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.61", "rDifficulty": "2.95", "rTAQuality": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "1.24", "rRecommendMajor": "1.44", "rCourseQuality": "1.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.28", "rInstructorAccess": "2.97", "rReadingsValue": "1.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.75", "rCommAbility": "1.61", "rInstructorQuality": "1.87"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH METHODS AND DESIGN", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "NURS-637-002", "path": "/courses/30766/sections/002", "id": "30766-002", "aliases": ["NURS-637-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 84, "path": "/courses/30766/sections/002/reviews/3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "first_name": "ROSEMARY C", "last_name": "POLOMANO", "id": "3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "name": "ROSEMARY C POLOMANO"}, "num_reviewers": 67, "id": "30766-002-3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.29", "rDifficulty": "2.61", "rTAQuality": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "2.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "2.88", "rReadingsValue": "2.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.34", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.90"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH METHODS AND DESIGN", "sectionnum": "003", "primary_alias": "NURS-637-003", "path": "/courses/30766/sections/003", "id": "30766-003", "aliases": ["NURS-637-003"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 54, "path": "/courses/30766/sections/003/reviews/4922-LINDA-A--HATFIELD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4922-LINDA-A--HATFIELD", "first_name": "LINDA A.", "last_name": "HATFIELD", "id": "4922-LINDA-A--HATFIELD", "name": "LINDA A.
