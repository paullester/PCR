However, students viewed the emphasis on rote memorization and unpredictable tests as highly unfavorable.  Despite the interest in course topics, students referred to the material as \u201cdry,\u201d \u201cdemanding,\u201d and \u201cdifficult,\u201d ultimately leaving the students wishing for more organization and structure in the course throughout the semester. \r\n\tProfessor Spatz and the teaching assistant were seen as supportive, and many students appreciated the positive learning environment they fostered.  Students commented that Spatz \u201cmakes a good effort to stimulate students.\u201d \r\n\tTests were described as \u201cnit-picky\u201d and \u201crandom,\u201d and left some students discouraged because they were not a \u201ctrue gauge of knowledge.\u201d Students who did well attributed it to luck, and overall students lamented the absence of a common thread with part one of this class taught in the fall semester. This course requires a prerequisite of NURS 230 or the equivalent.  In addition, students must have completed a semester of Junior Level clinicals. Also offered in 6 week Summer Session I and 12 week Summer Session I & II.\r\n", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/27909/sections/001/reviews/873-DIANE-L--SPATZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/873-DIANE-L--SPATZ", "first_name": "DIANE L.", "last_name": "SPATZ", "id": "873-DIANE-L--SPATZ", "name": "DIANE L.

Most students would have preferred a more interactive class, but acknowledged that the research skills learned in this class are valuable.  Students favored the classes that were taught by guest speakers.  The Power Points in lectures seemed outdated as did the textbook, but the methods of researching were still valid.\r\nProfessor Abbott used Power Point slides that seemed to have been created by another teacher, but managed to communicate the subject matter well when she \u201ctalked about her own experiences. \u201d  \r\nA few students felt that the vast amount of information presented in this class made the final exam unfair in that the questions seemed foreign.
