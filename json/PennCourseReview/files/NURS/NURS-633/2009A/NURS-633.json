{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4095"}, "description": "This seminar provides an overview of the process of applying for external funding for research traineeships. Through a series of lectures and discussions and computer laboratories, students will prepare a draft application that incorporates the essential components of describing the candidate, a research plan, sponsor or mentor, and the training environment. Students will become familiar with the process of submitting grants, developing time frames and work plans for the completion of applications. Students will also participate in activities designed to further develop a competitive application for doctoral study. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "GRANT WRITING FOR RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16225/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "GRANT WRITING FOR RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-633-301", "path": "/courses/16225/sections/301", "id": "16225-301", "aliases": ["NURS-633-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/16225/sections/301/reviews/2609-LINDA-A-MCCAULEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2609-LINDA-A-MCCAULEY", "first_name": "LINDA A", "last_name": "MCCAULEY", "id": "2609-LINDA-A-MCCAULEY", "name": "LINDA A MCCAULEY"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "16225-301-2609-LINDA-A-MCCAULEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-633", "path": "/courses/16225", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16225/sections", "values": [{"name": "GRANT WRITING FOR RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-633-301", "path": "/courses/16225/sections/301", "id": "16225-301", "aliases": ["NURS-633-301"]}]}, "id": 16225, "aliases": ["NURS-633"]}
