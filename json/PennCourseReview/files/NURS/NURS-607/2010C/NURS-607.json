One student wrote that she would love to take more classes on pathophysiology with Professor Tkacs.\r\n\r\nStudents generally thought that the course required a lot of work and reading, but that the payoff in terms of knowledge was worth it. Several students commented that they learned a lot of things that they could see applications for already.
