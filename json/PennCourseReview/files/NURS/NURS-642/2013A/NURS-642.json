Approaches to behavioral, psychological and medical co-morbidities are explored, practiced and evaluated. Students' clinical experiences build on the previous semester and continue with the application of class instruction to patient and family care. The student works closely with behaviorists, psychologists and occupational therapists to integrate nursing care planning with other services.
