{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/831"}, "description": "This course focuses on the development of knowledge and skills related to the use of psychopharmacologic agents to treat mental illness by the advanced practice nurse. Using a case study method to encourage the application of knowledge to clinical practice, the course addresses culturally diverse client populations, across the life span, who present with a range of symptom manifestations, at all levels of severity. The course emphasizes evidence-based practice, research-based clinical decision making and a wholistic approach to integrating the science and biology of the mind with social and behavioral interventions. The case base method allows students to focus on specific populations such as older adults, adults, adolescents, and children. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY ACROSS THE LIFESPAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30769/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.21", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY ACROSS THE LIFESPAN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-645-001", "path": "/courses/30769/sections/001", "id": "30769-001", "aliases": ["NURS-645-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/30769/sections/001/reviews/4067-LAURA-LEAHY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4067-LAURA-LEAHY", "first_name": "LAURA", "last_name": "LEAHY", "id": "4067-LAURA-LEAHY", "name": "LAURA LEAHY"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "30769-001-4067-LAURA-LEAHY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-645", "path": "/courses/30769", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30769/sections", "values": [{"name": "PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY ACROSS THE LIFESPAN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-645-001", "path": "/courses/30769/sections/001", "id": "30769-001", "aliases": ["NURS-645-001"]}]}, "id": 30769, "aliases": ["NURS-645"]}
