{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4096"}, "description": "Advanced analysis, design and evaluation of interventions to promote health and reduce health disparities with a focus on underserved ulnerable minority or ethnic populations, through culturally competent research, education and clinical practice. Areas to be evaluated include: -- Health disparities as it relates to health promotion and disease prevention behavioral intervention research in vulnerable communities -- Concepts of marginalization, race, ethnicity, class, gender and culture as it relates to health disparities -- Social-psychological theoretical and research approaches related to developing culturally congruent health promotion interventions to reduce health disparities for vulnerable populations -- The use of elicitation, focus groups and ethnographic techniques to tailor health behavior theory to meet the needs of the population -- Culturally competent research methodologies, involving education and/or clinical practice, e.g. culturally competent measures, recruitment, retention, and informed consent in hard to reach populations \n\n-- Community participatory research as a strategy for working with the community to build research partnership and build capacity for sustained health promotion initiatives -- Health promotion intervention strategies for reducing health disparities in vulnerable communities -- Strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in community and clinical settings -- Strategies for tailoring successful evidenced-based health promotion interventions to a variety of different populations for use in clinical trials and community settings -- Examine approaches for the translating and disseminating evidenced-based intervention research \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16264/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.25", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.13", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-823-301", "path": "/courses/16264/sections/301", "id": "16264-301", "aliases": ["NURS-823-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/16264/sections/301/reviews/3132-ANNE-M--TEITELMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3132-ANNE-M--TEITELMAN", "first_name": "ANNE M.", "last_name": "TEITELMAN", "id": "3132-ANNE-M--TEITELMAN", "name": "ANNE M.
