This case study examines the multiple challenges that surround the quality of health care in the evolving United States health care marketplace. Through classroom discussion and special project experience, the student will become familiar with the concept of health care quality and approaches to the measurement and management of quality. Using Donabedian's construct of structure, process and outcomes, strategies to improve quality while containing or reducing costs are reviewed, including the contributions of clinical practice guidelines. The evolving dominant structures for providing health care services, managed care and integrated delivery systems, and their approaches to quality management and reporting will be explored. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "CASE STUDY: QUALITY CARE CHALLENGES IN AN EVOLVING HEALTH CARE MARKET", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30740/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "CASE STUDY: QUALITY CARE CHALLENGES IN AN EVOLVING HEALTH CARE MARKET", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-359-001", "path": "/courses/30740/sections/001", "id": "30740-001", "aliases": ["NURS-359-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30740/sections/001/reviews/6143-KRISTA-M-PINOLA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6143-KRISTA-M-PINOLA", "first_name": "KRISTA M", "last_name": "PINOLA", "id": "6143-KRISTA-M-PINOLA", "name": "KRISTA M PINOLA"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "30740-001-6143-KRISTA-M-PINOLA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.53", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.73", "rInstructorQuality": "3.87"}, "section": {"name": "CASE STUDY: QUALITY CARE CHALLENGES IN AN EVOLVING HEALTH CARE MARKET", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-359-001", "path": "/courses/30740/sections/001", "id": "30740-001", "aliases": ["NURS-359-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/30740/sections/001/reviews/6144-MICHELLE-O-SPARROW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6144-MICHELLE-O-SPARROW", "first_name": "MICHELLE O", "last_name": "SPARROW", "id": "6144-MICHELLE-O-SPARROW", "name": "MICHELLE O SPARROW"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "30740-001-6144-MICHELLE-O-SPARROW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-359", "path": "/courses/30740", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30740/sections", "values": [{"name": "CASE STUDY: QUALITY CARE CHALLENGES IN AN EVOLVING HEALTH CARE MARKET", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-359-001", "path": "/courses/30740/sections/001", "id": "30740-001", "aliases": ["NURS-359-001"]}]}, "id": 30740, "aliases": ["NURS-359"]}
