The student is provided with a theory base necessary for the care of women, families, and their newborns. This theory base is organized according to the concepts of the person or family, environment, health and nursing and their relation to each other during childbearing. Using the nursing process, nursing strategies are developed for maintaining family members individually, for promoting optimal physiological and psychological functioning, and enhancing strengths within the family members and within the family unit. Clinical experiences provide opportunities for application and integration of the theory base with parents and newborns. The student participates in clinical experiences in a variety of settings including acute care facilities, the community, and the Instructional Technology Center (ITC). The student will care for families with both simple and complex needs in all phases of the childbearing cycle. During this course, the student will assist in managing the care of families during the antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum, and neonatal periods. \r\nStudents were generally very enthusiastic about the class and thought that it was very useful and entertaining. They said that Professor Mamie was a great instructor who \u201chas a wonderful ability to stimulate students\u2019 interest.\u201d They claimed that they learned a lot and also enjoyed the level of participation that was encouraged in the class as well as how approachable the professor was. A student said that it was \u201cdefinitely her favorite clinical rotation so far.\u201d However, some think that the instructor relied too heavily on the students teaching each other and would prefer more typical straight-forward lectures. \r\nStudents sometimes felt that the tests did not cover the materials emphasized in class and some questions were too focused on memorization of facts rather than understanding the theory. Furthermore, more guidance with papers would have made the class better. However, they said that they thought the overall grading distribution was fair. They also mentioned that the aspect of the class that they did not like as much was the presentations at the end because they were too time-consuming and somewhat disjointed.
