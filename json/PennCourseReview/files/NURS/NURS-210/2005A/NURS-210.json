{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/802"}, "description": "Course content is based on a family centered approach in which the needs of the family members during various phases of the childbearing process are considered. The student is provided with a theory base necessary for the care of women, families, and their newborns. This theory base is organized according to the concepts of the person or family, environment, health and nursing and their relation to each other during childbearing. Using the nursing process, nursing strategies are developed for maintaining family members individually, for promoting optimal physiological and psychological functioning, and enhancing strengths within the family members and within the family unit. \n\nClinical experiences provide opportunities for application and integration of the theory base with parents and newborns. The student participates in clinical experiences in a variety of settings including acute care facilities, the community, and the Instructional Technology Center (ITC). The student will care for families with both simple and complex needs in all phases of the childbearing cycle. During this course, the student will assist in managing the care of families during the antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum, and neonatal periods. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "NURSING OF THE CHILDBEARING FAMILY: THEORY/CLINICAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10754/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.49", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "3.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.98", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39", "rReadingsValue": "3.08", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.36", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.76"}, "section": {"name": "NURSING OF THE CHILDBEARING FAMILY: THEORY/CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-001", "path": "/courses/10754/sections/001", "id": "10754-001", "aliases": ["NURS-210-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 62, "path": "/courses/10754/sections/001/reviews/3098-MARY-GUIDERA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3098-MARY-GUIDERA", "first_name": "MARY", "last_name": "GUIDERA", "id": "3098-MARY-GUIDERA", "name": "MARY GUIDERA"}, "num_reviewers": 59, "id": "10754-001-3098-MARY-GUIDERA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC: HUP DAYS", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-101", "path": "/courses/10754/sections/101", "id": "10754-101", "aliases": ["NURS-210-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/10754/sections/101/reviews/3104-SANGSOON-YOUSSEF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3104-SANGSOON-YOUSSEF", "first_name": "SANGSOON", "last_name": "YOUSSEF", "id": "3104-SANGSOON-YOUSSEF", "name": "SANGSOON YOUSSEF"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "10754-101-3104-SANGSOON-YOUSSEF"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.75", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.88", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC: LANKENAU", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-102", "path": "/courses/10754/sections/102", "id": "10754-102", "aliases": ["NURS-210-102"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/10754/sections/102/reviews/2595-JESSICA-G-SCHWARZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2595-JESSICA-G-SCHWARZ", "first_name": "JESSICA G", "last_name": "SCHWARZ", "id": "2595-JESSICA-G-SCHWARZ", "name": "JESSICA G SCHWARZ"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "10754-102-2595-JESSICA-G-SCHWARZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.88", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.38", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC: PA HOSP DAYS", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-103", "path": "/courses/10754/sections/103", "id": "10754-103", "aliases": ["NURS-210-103"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/10754/sections/103/reviews/2246-CHRISTINE-E--JENNINGS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2246-CHRISTINE-E--JENNINGS", "first_name": "CHRISTINE E.", "last_name": "JENNINGS", "id": "2246-CHRISTINE-E--JENNINGS", "name": "CHRISTINE E.
