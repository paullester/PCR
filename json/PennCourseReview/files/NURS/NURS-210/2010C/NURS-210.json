Several students complained that the information tested was provided \u201cinformally,\u201d and that, due to the fact that instructors were frequently \u201cunclear on what was expected,\u201d \u201cthe examinations for this class are not designed for [students] to pass them, but rather for us to somehow manage to not fail them.\u201d One student attested that he spent 12 hours on each \u201cmodule,\u201d and several commented that they \u201ctake an immense amount of time\u201d and \u201cfeel like busy work.\u201d Some students, though, were pleased that correct answers were provided and reviewed after turning in the assignment.\r\n", "num_students": 86, "path": "/courses/23520/sections/201/reviews/4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "first_name": "ANGELA", "last_name": "IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "id": "4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "name": "ANGELA IORIANNI-CIMBAK"}, "num_reviewers": 78, "id": "23520-201-4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-210", "path": "/courses/23520", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23520/sections", "values": [{"name": "NURSING OF THE CHILDBEARING FAMILY: THEORY/CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-001", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/001", "id": "23520-001", "aliases": ["NURS-210-001"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: HUP DAYS", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-101", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/101", "id": "23520-101", "aliases": ["NURS-210-101"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: LANKENAU DAYS", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-102", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/102", "id": "23520-102", "aliases": ["NURS-210-102"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: PA HOSP DAYS", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-103", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/103", "id": "23520-103", "aliases": ["NURS-210-103"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: HUP EVENINGS", "sectionnum": "104", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-104", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/104", "id": "23520-104", "aliases": ["NURS-210-104"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: LANKENAU EVENINGS", "sectionnum": "105", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-105", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/105", "id": "23520-105", "aliases": ["NURS-210-105"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: DE COUNTY 12HR", "sectionnum": "106", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-106", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/106", "id": "23520-106", "aliases": ["NURS-210-106"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: PAOLI 12HR TUES", "sectionnum": "107", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-107", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/107", "id": "23520-107", "aliases": ["NURS-210-107"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: HUP EVENINGS", "sectionnum": "108", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-108", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/108", "id": "23520-108", "aliases": ["NURS-210-108"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: DE COUNTY 12HR", "sectionnum": "109", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-109", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/109", "id": "23520-109", "aliases": ["NURS-210-109"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: HUP SATURDAYS", "sectionnum": "110", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-110", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/110", "id": "23520-110", "aliases": ["NURS-210-110"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: HUP SUNDAYS", "sectionnum": "111", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-111", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/111", "id": "23520-111", "aliases": ["NURS-210-111"]}, {"name": "LABORATORY", "sectionnum": "201", "primary_alias": "NURS-210-201", "path": "/courses/23520/sections/201", "id": "23520-201", "aliases": ["NURS-210-201"]}]}, "id": 23520, "aliases": ["NURS-210"]}
