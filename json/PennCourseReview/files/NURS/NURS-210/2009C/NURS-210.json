As a result, most students were concerned that the exams did not take into account the different information received from various teachers. In general, though, the students agree that the \u201cskills learned\u2026 are very helpful.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Iorianni-Cimbak was described as \u201cextremely knowledgeable and helpful\u201d and \u201cgreat about finding time to meet and explain concepts to people.\u201d Students found Professor Iorianni-Cimbak accessible via email and occasionally in person. Each lab section had a different instructor so many of the comments related to these individuals rather than to Professor Iorianni-Cimbak specifically.\r\n\r\nStudents were dissatisfied with the large amounts of work required for this course since it was only worth a low percentage of the overall class grade. The modules were described as \u201cbusy work\u201d by many of the students. Others did not appreciate the \u201cunnecessarily long\u201d exams after the equally long validation sessions. Yet, one student stated that the lab \u201cis very valuable in preparing us to be good nurses.\u201d This portion of the course is open to junior nursing students only. Students from other majors should not take this course.
