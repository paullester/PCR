Topics that will be covered include measurements, atomic structure, bonding, chemical reactions, properties of gases and liquids, solutions, equilibrium, acids and bases, pH, buffers, nuclear chemistry, nomenclature and properties of the main organic functional groups, and the structures and function of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.\r\n\r\nMost students found this course to be both interesting and challenging. Nearly all students thought that the course moved very quickly, and that outside help such as tutors, optional assignments and readings, and recitations were key to understanding the material. A few students reported that the textbook was hard to understand and was not very helpful. Furthermore, most students thought that the course taught them a lot about chemistry.\r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 comments concerning Professor Lafferty-Della Valle\u2019s teaching abilities were mixed. One student described Professor Lafferty as \u201cbrilliant,\u201d while another thought that the professor\u2019s notes were unclear.\r\n\r\nMost students agreed that the course moved very quickly, and some thought that it  moved too fast for an intro course. One student noted that the expectations concerning readings and notes were unclear at the beginning of the semester. Most students also wrote that the course was very challenging, although they also stated that they were happy with the grades they received based on the amount of work they put into the class.\r\n", "num_students": 90, "path": "/courses/23514/sections/001/reviews/864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE", "first_name": "MARY ANN", "last_name": "LAFFERTY-DELLA VALLE", "id": "864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE", "name": "MARY ANN LAFFERTY-DELLA VALLE"}, "num_reviewers": 86, "id": "23514-001-864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.23", "rDifficulty": "2.92", "rStimulateInterest": "2.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "2.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.15", "rInstructorQuality": "2.47"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY: LAB", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-040-101", "path": "/courses/23514/sections/101", "id": "23514-101", "aliases": ["NURS-040-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/23514/sections/101/reviews/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "first_name": "JUAN F", "last_name": "MUNIZ", "id": "5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "name": "JUAN F MUNIZ"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "23514-101-5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.57", "rDifficulty": "2.86", "rStimulateInterest": "2.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "2.64", "rInstructorAccess": "2.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.21", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.79"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY: LAB", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-040-102", "path": "/courses/23514/sections/102", "id": "23514-102", "aliases": ["NURS-040-102"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/23514/sections/102/reviews/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "first_name": "JUAN F", "last_name": "MUNIZ", "id": "5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "name": "JUAN F MUNIZ"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "23514-102-5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.82", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "2.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.59", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "2.35", "rReadingsValue": "2.69", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "2.12", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY: LAB", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-040-103", "path": "/courses/23514/sections/103", "id": "23514-103", "aliases": ["NURS-040-103"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/23514/sections/103/reviews/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "first_name": "JUAN F", "last_name": "MUNIZ", "id": "5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "name": "JUAN F MUNIZ"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "23514-103-5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.41", "rInstructorAccess": "2.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.41", "rCommAbility": "2.31", "rInstructorQuality": "2.67"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY: LAB", "sectionnum": "104", "primary_alias": "NURS-040-104", "path": "/courses/23514/sections/104", "id": "23514-104", "aliases": ["NURS-040-104"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/23514/sections/104/reviews/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "first_name": "JUAN F", "last_name": "MUNIZ", "id": "5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "name": "JUAN F MUNIZ"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "23514-104-5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "2.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "2.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.22", "rInstructorAccess": "2.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.78", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.69"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY: LAB", "sectionnum": "105", "primary_alias": "NURS-040-105", "path": "/courses/23514/sections/105", "id": "23514-105", "aliases": ["NURS-040-105"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/23514/sections/105/reviews/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "first_name": "JUAN F", "last_name": "MUNIZ", "id": "5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ", "name": "JUAN F MUNIZ"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "23514-105-5649-JUAN-F-MUNIZ"}]
