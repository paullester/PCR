{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2359"}, "description": "This blended online/in-classroom graduate level course integrates principles of systems thinking with foundational concepts in patient safety. Utilizing complexity theories, students assess healthcare practices and identify factors that contribute to medical errors and impact patient safety. Using a clinical microsystem framework, learners assess a potential patient safety issue and create preventive systems. Lessons learned from the science of safety are utilized in developing strategies to enhance safe system redesign. Core competencies for all healthcare professionals are emphasized, content is applicable for all healthcare providers including, but not limited to, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, social workers and healthcare administrators, and may be taken as an elective by non-majors. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "HEALTH SYSTEMS ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5687/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "2.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.30", "rWorkRequired": "3.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.10", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "HEALTH SYSTEMS ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-650-001", "path": "/courses/5687/sections/001", "id": "5687-001", "aliases": ["NURS-650-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/5687/sections/001/reviews/1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI", "first_name": "CYNTHIA CLAIRE", "last_name": "SCALZI", "id": "1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI", "name": "CYNTHIA CLAIRE SCALZI"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "5687-001-1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "LABORATORY", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-650-101", "path": "/courses/5687/sections/101", "id": "5687-101", "aliases": ["NURS-650-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/5687/sections/101/reviews/1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI", "first_name": "CYNTHIA CLAIRE", "last_name": "SCALZI", "id": "1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI", "name": "CYNTHIA CLAIRE SCALZI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "5687-101-1915-CYNTHIA-CLAIRE-SCALZI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.11", "rReadingsValue": "2.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.40", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "LABORATORY", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-650-101", "path": "/courses/5687/sections/101", "id": "5687-101", "aliases": ["NURS-650-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/5687/sections/101/reviews/2288-KATHLEEN-G--BURKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2288-KATHLEEN-G--BURKE", "first_name": "KATHLEEN G.", "last_name": "BURKE", "id": "2288-KATHLEEN-G--BURKE", "name": "KATHLEEN G.
