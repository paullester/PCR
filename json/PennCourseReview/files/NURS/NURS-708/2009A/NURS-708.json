{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/841"}, "description": "This course will explore the philosophy and growth of public policy that has directed the American Health Care System in its ever expanding movement toward universal health care for all citizens. Analysis of health policy and systems content will assist the students to identify the knowledge and skills needed for the health or human service provider to assume leadership roles in the formulation of public policy for change; this includes system restructuring, service delivery and funding of health care. Emphasis will be on the effect of policy on the individual/family user of health care services rather than the effect on professional health care providers or health care delivery systems. Special attention will be given to the effect of policy on populations, both urban and rural, living near and below the poverty level. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "PUBLIC POLICY LEADERSHIP IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16242/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.16", "rWorkRequired": "2.48", "rInstructorAccess": "3.52", "rReadingsValue": "2.72", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "3.68", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "PUBLIC POLICY LEADERSHIP IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-708-001", "path": "/courses/16242/sections/001", "id": "16242-001", "aliases": ["NURS-708-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/16242/sections/001/reviews/889-DAWN-C--DURAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/889-DAWN-C--DURAIN", "first_name": "DAWN C.", "last_name": "DURAIN", "id": "889-DAWN-C--DURAIN", "name": "DAWN C.
