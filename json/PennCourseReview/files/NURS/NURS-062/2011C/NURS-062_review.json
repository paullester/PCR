The context for this course is the\r\napplication of cell biology to understanding the cellular basis of human diseases and the\r\nrole of genetics and genomics in health and disease processes. The course centers on\r\nvarious case studies to present the material.\r\nOverall students felt they learned a great deal of material over the course of the\r\nsemester. Students commented that the material covered was extremely thorough, delving\r\ninto a great depth of biological topics. Both students who had not taken biology in years\r\nand those that had recently taken AP Biology felt they left the class having learned a\r\ngreat deal. This course is a bit unconventional due to the large faculty instructing\r\nstudents. Some students found the breadth of instruction overwhelming, and\r\n\u201cinconsistent.\u201d\r\nMany students took this course as their first science-oriented nursing class and\r\nwere surprised at how quickly they were immersed straight into such difficult and\r\ndetailed material. Many were concerned or felt disadvantaged by not having taken\r\nbiology for a few years and were overwhelmed with the amount of material that was\r\ncovered. In fact, most students felt that there was too much material to be covered\r\ncomfortably over the course of the semester. Readings were described as \u201cvery detailed\u201d\r\nand required great concentration. Overall, many found the course rewarding. Students\r\nnoted that hard work was required; individuals had to remain constantly working on\r\nassignments, readings, and actively engaged in the class.
