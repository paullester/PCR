Topics covered include measurements, atomic structure, bonding, chemical\r\nreactions, properties of gases and liquids, solutions, equilibrium, acids and bases, pH,\r\nbuffers, nuclear chemistry, nomenclature and properties of the main organic functional\r\ngroups, and the structures and function of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.\r\nStudents commented that the class covered a lot of material in a short amount of\r\ntime. Several students with more prior exposure to chemistry remarked that the material\r\nwas too basic. The class provided a \"substantial background knowledge base\" with many\r\nreal-world nursing applications, which many students found immensely helpful.\r\nSeveral students noted Dr. Lafferty\u2019s efforts to provide helpful handouts and\r\ncreate fair tests. One student remarked that, despite the amount of material, Dr. Lafferty\r\n\"spent enough time on the harder concepts.\"\r\nOverall, students found the course straightforward, interesting, and useful.
