{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5458"}, "description": "The growth of global markets, expansion of worldwide communication and travel, and the complexity of international political interests, along with natural disasters and environmental pollutions have contributed to health inequities and demonstrated the interdependence of health care systems. This course explores relationships between health and globalization as they reflect and generate health and health care inequities along the fault lines of gender, wealth, and political will. Topics address current global issues such as international migration of health personnel, e-health and m-health, medical tourism, human trafficking, food security, pharmaceutical commerce, and war and conflict. The course equips students with the analytical skills to evaluate and propose solutions to these global challenges to health and health care. Coursework engages students through class discussions, course readings, and written assignments including correspondence with international peers. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "GLOBALIZATION, HEALTH, AND HEALTHCARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27890/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.20", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rTAQuality": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "1.20", "rCourseQuality": "1.83", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.40", "rReadingsValue": "2.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.20", "rCommAbility": "2.40", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBALIZATION, HEALTH, AND HEALTHCARE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-514-001", "path": "/courses/27890/sections/001", "id": "27890-001", "aliases": ["NURS-514-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/27890/sections/001/reviews/4499-MARJORIE-A--MUECKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4499-MARJORIE-A--MUECKE", "first_name": "MARJORIE A.", "last_name": "MUECKE", "id": "4499-MARJORIE-A--MUECKE", "name": "MARJORIE A.
