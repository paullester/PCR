{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3805"}, "description": "This course will promote personal and professional socialization of master's students for transition to doctoral study and emphasize mentoring and experiential learning as tools to support scholarly development. A range of scholarly literature will be examined to focus on existing programs of research and related methodological concerns. Critical thinking will be emphasized. Teaching strategies will provide opportunities to confirm the purpose of doctoral study in nursing, to understand the scope of the researcher role, to define personal and professional goals, to identify the contributions of research in the development of new nursing knowledge, to understand and value the need to create the next generation of nurse scientists, and to develop productive mentoring relationships. Opportunities will be provided for dialogue and active participation with nurse researchers and definition of beginning research questions, along with the requisite skills to understand approaches to them. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "BRIDGE TO SCHOLARSHIP: ESTABLISHING THE PATHWAY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12705/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.88", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.63", "rWorkRequired": "3.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.88"}, "section": {"name": "BRIDGE TO SCHOLARSHIP: ESTABLISHING THE PATHWAY", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-631-900", "path": "/courses/12705/sections/900", "id": "12705-900", "aliases": ["NURS-631-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/12705/sections/900/reviews/3861-MARGARET-J-GRIFFITHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3861-MARGARET-J-GRIFFITHS", "first_name": "MARGARET J", "last_name": "GRIFFITHS", "id": "3861-MARGARET-J-GRIFFITHS", "name": "MARGARET J GRIFFITHS"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "12705-900-3861-MARGARET-J-GRIFFITHS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-631", "path": "/courses/12705", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12705/sections", "values": [{"name": "BRIDGE TO SCHOLARSHIP: ESTABLISHING THE PATHWAY", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-631-900", "path": "/courses/12705/sections/900", "id": "12705-900", "aliases": ["NURS-631-900"]}]}, "id": 12705, "aliases": ["NURS-631"]}
