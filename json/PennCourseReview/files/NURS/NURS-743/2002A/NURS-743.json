{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/848"}, "description": "This course focuses on identifying at risk and high risk maternal fetal dyads, developing knowledge relating to assessment of fetal well being, and understanding the implications of obstetric, non obstertric, and fetal complications on the management of the high risk pregnancy. Additionally the course provides an understanding of the scientific basis for new technologies used to evaluate at risk and high risk populations. Information about the physics of ultrasound, pulse echo imaging, and doppler techniques will be provided. Students must be able to practice ultrasound skills while in this course. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "FETAL EVALUATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/848/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.25", "rDifficulty": "1.42", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rRecommendMajor": "2.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "1.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.27", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.58"}, "section": {"name": "FETAL EVALUATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-743-001", "path": "/courses/848/sections/001", "id": "848-001", "aliases": ["NURS-743-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/848/sections/001/reviews/920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "first_name": "MARILYN", "last_name": "STRINGER", "id": "920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "name": "MARILYN STRINGER"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "848-001-920-MARILYN-STRINGER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.00", "rDifficulty": "1.00", "rStimulateInterest": "1.50", "rRecommendMajor": "0.50", "rCourseQuality": "1.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "1.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "1.50", "rInstructorQuality": "1.50"}, "section": {"name": "FETAL EVALUATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "NURS-743-002", "path": "/courses/848/sections/002", "id": "848-002", "aliases": ["NURS-743-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/848/sections/002/reviews/920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "first_name": "MARILYN", "last_name": "STRINGER", "id": "920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "name": "MARILYN STRINGER"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "848-002-920-MARILYN-STRINGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-743", "path": "/courses/848", "sections": {"path": "/courses/848/sections", "values": [{"name": "FETAL EVALUATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-743-001", "path": "/courses/848/sections/001", "id": "848-001", "aliases": ["NURS-743-001"]}, {"name": "FETAL EVALUATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "NURS-743-002", "path": "/courses/848/sections/002", "id": "848-002", "aliases": ["NURS-743-002"]}]}, "id": 848, "aliases": ["NURS-743"]}
