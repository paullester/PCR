Human milk is recognized universally as the optimal diet for newborn infants. The health benefits of breastfeeding are so significant that a National Health Objective set forth by the Surgeon General of the United States for the year 2010 is to increase the proportion of mothers who breastfeed their babies in the postpartum period. Through classroom and clinical experiences, this course provides an in-depth examination of the anatomy and physiology of lactation, essential aspects of establishing and maintaining lactation, and the nurses' role in counseling the breastfeeding family. This class emphasizes current research findings in the content area.\r\n\r\nStudents overall felt that they \u201cnever knew there was so much to learn about breastfeeding\u201d and that they recognized the importance of the material. Many \u201clearned a lot\u201d in terms of theory and practice and felt that the research articles were \u201cbeneficial.\u201d Some reported that shadowing lactation consultants could be \u201cstressful trying to schedule all of the hours,\u201d but that it was a rewarding experience regardless. One student remarked that she \u201cloved clinical hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Spatz was praised for having \u201cwonderful course structure\u201d and \u201ceffectively integrating students into the field of study.\u201d One student did note that \u201coffice hours are short and at inconvenient times.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents generally liked that they could focus \u201cmore on the content as a whole and enjoy the lectures\u201d since there were no tests. One student commented that she had a \u201cmuch better grasp on being able to read, interpret, and analyze an article to make suggestions for future studies.\u201d Students completed 1-page \u201cresearch critiques\u201d and a large project. Students agreed that the course was \u201cwork-heavy\u201d and \u201cstressful,\u201d but that it was overall beneficial and a \u201cgreat course for anyone who thinks that they are going to work with women and babies.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/23536/sections/001/reviews/873-DIANE-L--SPATZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/873-DIANE-L--SPATZ", "first_name": "DIANE L.", "last_name": "SPATZ", "id": "873-DIANE-L--SPATZ", "name": "DIANE L.
