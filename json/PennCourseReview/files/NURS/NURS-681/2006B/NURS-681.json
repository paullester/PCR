{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3571"}, "description": "This course provides an in-depth analysis of the anatomy, physiology and patho-physiology of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and related anesthesia implications. The concepts of ventilation and perfusion as they relate to oxygen and anesthetic delivery and metabolism are examined. The effects of compromised cardiac and pulmonary function and their implications for the patient and anesthesia plan are reviewed. The impact of anesthesia on the structure and function of the heart as a pump as well as the characteristics of systemic circulation will be explored. The effect of surgery and anesthesia on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems will be emphasized. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9823/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.39", "rDifficulty": "3.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.39", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.78", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-681-900", "path": "/courses/9823/sections/900", "id": "9823-900", "aliases": ["NURS-681-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/9823/sections/900/reviews/893-NANCY-C-TKACS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/893-NANCY-C-TKACS", "first_name": "NANCY C", "last_name": "TKACS", "id": "893-NANCY-C-TKACS", "name": "NANCY C TKACS"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "9823-900-893-NANCY-C-TKACS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.53", "rDifficulty": "3.12", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.76", "rCourseQuality": "3.41", "rWorkRequired": "3.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.88", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.35"}, "section": {"name": "APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-681-900", "path": "/courses/9823/sections/900", "id": "9823-900", "aliases": ["NURS-681-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/9823/sections/900/reviews/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "MAGRO", "id": "3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "name": "MARIA MAGRO"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "9823-900-3128-MARIA-MAGRO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-681", "path": "/courses/9823", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9823/sections", "values": [{"name": "APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-681-900", "path": "/courses/9823/sections/900", "id": "9823-900", "aliases": ["NURS-681-900"]}]}, "id": 9823, "aliases": ["NURS-681"]}
