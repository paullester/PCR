{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2886"}, "description": "This the first of a two-course sequence designed for doctoral students interested in conducting health outcomes research. The first course (821) focuses on conceptual, methodological, statistical, feasibility and data issues central to the conduct of health outcomes research; the second course (822) focuses on applying health outcomes research through the development and implementation of a research project. In the first course Penn faculty researchers will use their ongoing studies to illustrate how study design, sampling, measurement, and advanced statistical techniques can be employed to address the various challenges inherent in health outcomes research. In the second course, students will design and implement a health outcomes research project. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PROSEMINAR IN HEALTH OUTCOMES RESEARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PROSEMINAR IN HEALTH OUTCOMES RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-821-401", "path": "/courses/6941/sections/401", "id": "6941-401", "aliases": ["NURS-821-401", "SOCI-821-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/6941/sections/401/reviews/2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "first_name": "EILEEN", "last_name": "LAKE", "id": "2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "name": "EILEEN LAKE"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "6941-401-2235-EILEEN-LAKE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-821", "path": "/courses/6941", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6941/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROSEMINAR IN HEALTH OUTCOMES RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-821-401", "path": "/courses/6941/sections/401", "id": "6941-401", "aliases": ["NURS-821-401", "SOCI-821-401"]}]}, "id": 6941, "aliases": ["NURS-821", "SOCI-821"]}
