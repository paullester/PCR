{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2646"}, "description": "This course provides students the opportunity to integrate theory into practice within the clinical setting. The focus is on the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, ethical and cultural judgments with the perioperative patient. Students progress from the care of healthy patinets undergoing minimally invasive surgerical procedures to the more complex patient with multiple health issues. The student begins to develop an advanced practice nursing role that integrates role theory, nursing theory, and research knowledge through weekly seminars. Scope of practice, role development and nursing interventions will be introduced and explored in the classroom, and principles will be applied in the clinical practicum. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "CLINIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12249/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.72", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.65", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.81", "rCommAbility": "3.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "CLINICAL FIELDWORK FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA PRACTICE I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-791-301", "path": "/courses/12249/sections/301", "id": "12249-301", "aliases": ["NURS-791-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/12249/sections/301/reviews/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "MAGRO", "id": "3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "name": "MARIA MAGRO"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "12249-301-3128-MARIA-MAGRO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-791", "path": "/courses/12249", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12249/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-791-101", "path": "/courses/12249/sections/101", "id": "12249-101", "aliases": ["NURS-791-101"]}, {"name": "CLINICAL FIELDWORK FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA PRACTICE I", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-791-301", "path": "/courses/12249/sections/301", "id": "12249-301", "aliases": ["NURS-791-301"]}]}, "id": 12249, "aliases": ["NURS-791"]}
