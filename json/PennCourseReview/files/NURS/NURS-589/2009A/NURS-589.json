{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4367"}, "description": "This course, for nursing and medical students explores theory and research about physiologic stress responses as the basis for a standardized, replicable mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention. Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention is a previously standardized, evidenced based, clinical intervention that provides a systematic approach to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience (mindfulness) of perceptible mental processes. The concept of the stress reaction, the biology of the effects of stress on the body, mindfulness-based communication, and its role in healing experienced by patients, will be critically examined in a culturally relevant context. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: THEORY AND PRACTICE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16220/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.07", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.19", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.07", "rInstructorQuality": "3.19"}, "section": {"name": "MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: THEORY AND PRACTICE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-589-001", "path": "/courses/16220/sections/001", "id": "16220-001", "aliases": ["NURS-589-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/16220/sections/001/reviews/920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "first_name": "MARILYN", "last_name": "STRINGER", "id": "920-MARILYN-STRINGER", "name": "MARILYN STRINGER"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "16220-001-920-MARILYN-STRINGER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.07", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.19", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: THEORY AND PRACTICE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-589-001", "path": "/courses/16220/sections/001", "id": "16220-001", "aliases": ["NURS-589-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/16220/sections/001/reviews/4502-KAREN-E--BOWLES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4502-KAREN-E--BOWLES", "first_name": "KAREN E.", "last_name": "BOWLES", "id": "4502-KAREN-E--BOWLES", "name": "KAREN E.
