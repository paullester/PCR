{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4367"}, "description": "This course, for nursing and medical students explores theory and research about physiologic stress responses as the basis for a standardized, replicable mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention. Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention is a previously standardized, evidenced based, clinical intervention that provides a systematic approach to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience (mindfulness) of perceptible mental processes. The concept of the stress reaction, the biology of the effects of stress on the body, mindfulness-based communication, and its role in healing experienced by patients, will be critically examined in a culturally relevant context. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: THEORY AND PRACTICE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22186/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.31", "rDifficulty": "1.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION: THEORY AND PRACTICE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-589-001", "path": "/courses/22186/sections/001", "id": "22186-001", "aliases": ["NURS-589-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/22186/sections/001/reviews/1651-WENDY-D--GRUBE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1651-WENDY-D--GRUBE", "first_name": "WENDY D.", "last_name": "GRUBE", "id": "1651-WENDY-D--GRUBE", "name": "WENDY D.
