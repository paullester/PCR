{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2030"}, "description": "Selected aspects of genetics, biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology are presented and applied to nursing care. Embryonic, histologic, and gross anatomical features of certain organ systems are functionally related to biochemical and physiological mechanisms essential for the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Special emphasis is placed upon integrating functions of the nervous and endocrine systems. Certain deviations from normal metabolism, structure and function are detailed. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "BIOCHEMICAL & PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF METABOLISM & HUMAN DISEASE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3314/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.53", "rDifficulty": "3.28", "rStimulateInterest": "3.39", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.61"}, "section": {"name": "BIOCHEMICAL & PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF METABOLISM & HUMAN DISEASE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-605-001", "path": "/courses/3314/sections/001", "id": "3314-001", "aliases": ["NURS-605-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 58, "path": "/courses/3314/sections/001/reviews/864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE", "first_name": "MARY ANN", "last_name": "LAFFERTY-DELLA VALLE", "id": "864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE", "name": "MARY ANN LAFFERTY-DELLA VALLE"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "3314-001-864-MARY-ANN-LAFFERTY-DELLA-VALLE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-605", "path": "/courses/3314", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3314/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOCHEMICAL & PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF METABOLISM & HUMAN DISEASE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-605-001", "path": "/courses/3314/sections/001", "id": "3314-001", "aliases": ["NURS-605-001"]}]}, "id": 3314, "aliases": ["NURS-605"]}
