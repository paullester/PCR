{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3190"}, "description": "The escalating incidence and prevalence of aggression in the health care setting requires that providers acquire a new set of pragmatic competencies for managing its complex sequelae. This course presents theoretical frameworks for understanding, predicting, preventing and responding to aggressive behaviors across the life span. Historical, bio-behavioral, social, and cultural explanations for aggression will be synthesized and analyzed within the context of multiple points of entry into the health care system across clinical settings. Personal self-awareness, debriefing, and stress management techniques exemplify techniques to prevent untoward consequences in providers. This course also uses exemplars and a range of experiential learning strategies, including skill development, situation analysis, concept mapping, unfolding case studies and cooperative learning, to examine the assessment, prevention, treatment, and response to aggressive behavior in patients and management of its consequences in self and others. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "CSE STDY-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IN HEALTHCARE:ASSESSMENT,PREVENTION,&TREATMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22163/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.00", "rDifficulty": "0.91", "rStimulateInterest": "1.73", "rRecommendMajor": "1.64", "rCourseQuality": "1.13", "rWorkRequired": "1.18", "rInstructorAccess": "2.09", "rReadingsValue": "1.27", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.27", "rCommAbility": "1.91", "rInstructorQuality": "1.80"}, "section": {"name": "CSE STDY-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IN HEALTHCARE:ASSESSMENT,PREVENTION,&TREATMENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-363-001", "path": "/courses/22163/sections/001", "id": "22163-001", "aliases": ["NURS-363-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/22163/sections/001/reviews/2630-CHRISTOPHER-LANCE-COLEMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2630-CHRISTOPHER-LANCE-COLEMAN", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER LANCE", "last_name": "COLEMAN", "id": "2630-CHRISTOPHER-LANCE-COLEMAN", "name": "CHRISTOPHER LANCE COLEMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "22163-001-2630-CHRISTOPHER-LANCE-COLEMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-363", "path": "/courses/22163", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22163/sections", "values": [{"name": "CSE STDY-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IN HEALTHCARE:ASSESSMENT,PREVENTION,&TREATMENT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-363-001", "path": "/courses/22163/sections/001", "id": "22163-001", "aliases": ["NURS-363-001"]}]}, "id": 22163, "aliases": ["NURS-363"]}
