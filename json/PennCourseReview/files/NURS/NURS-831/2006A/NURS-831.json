{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2887"}, "description": "This course is designed to survey a broad range of advanced topics in the field of health informatics. Course faculty and invited speakers will provide the content for weekly meetings conducted in a blended environment (both on-line and in the classroom). Each week, students will listen to a lecture and then participate in a group discussion. Approximately half of these lecture/discussion sessions will take place in a a \"live\" classroom, while the remainder will be available asynchronously in an online setting (i.e. using Blackboard). There will be no textbook, however each speaker will provide links to web-based resources that provide either background information or further elaboration of their topic. A group of students (depending upon size of class, probably 2-3 per topic) will take the lead for each topic, communicating with the speaker and facilitating the class discussion. As a final project, these student groups will also develop a more complete web resource for their selected topic. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8173/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-831", "path": "/courses/8173", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8173/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-831-301", "path": "/courses/8173/sections/301", "id": "8173-301", "aliases": ["NURS-831-301"]}]}, "id": 8173, "aliases": ["NURS-831"]}
