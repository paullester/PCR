{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2887"}, "description": "This course is designed to survey a broad range of advanced topics in the field of health informatics. Course faculty and invited speakers will provide the content for weekly meetings conducted in a blended environment (both on-line and in the classroom). Each week, students will listen to a lecture and then participate in a group discussion. Approximately half of these lecture/discussion sessions will take place in a a \"live\" classroom, while the remainder will be available asynchronously in an online setting (i.e. using Blackboard). There will be no textbook, however each speaker will provide links to web-based resources that provide either background information or further elaboration of their topic. A group of students (depending upon size of class, probably 2-3 per topic) will take the lead for each topic, communicating with the speaker and facilitating the class discussion. As a final project, these student groups will also develop a more complete web resource for their selected topic. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27953/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.71", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rTAQuality": "1.00", "rStimulateInterest": "1.43", "rRecommendMajor": "2.43", "rCourseQuality": "1.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "0.14", "rReadingsValue": "1.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.86", "rCommAbility": "1.29", "rInstructorQuality": "0.86"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-831-301", "path": "/courses/27953/sections/301", "id": "27953-301", "aliases": ["NURS-831-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/27953/sections/301/reviews/6155-ROBERT-D-SUNDAY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6155-ROBERT-D-SUNDAY", "first_name": "ROBERT D", "last_name": "SUNDAY", "id": "6155-ROBERT-D-SUNDAY", "name": "ROBERT D SUNDAY"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "27953-301-6155-ROBERT-D-SUNDAY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-831", "path": "/courses/27953", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27953/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-831-301", "path": "/courses/27953/sections/301", "id": "27953-301", "aliases": ["NURS-831-301"]}]}, "id": 27953, "aliases": ["NURS-831"]}
