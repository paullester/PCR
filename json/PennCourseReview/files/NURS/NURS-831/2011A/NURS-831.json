{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2887"}, "description": "This course is designed to survey a broad range of advanced topics in the field of health informatics. Course faculty and invited speakers will provide the content for weekly meetings conducted in a blended environment (both on-line and in the classroom). Each week, students will listen to a lecture and then participate in a group discussion. Approximately half of these lecture/discussion sessions will take place in a a \"live\" classroom, while the remainder will be available asynchronously in an online setting (i.e. using Blackboard). There will be no textbook, however each speaker will provide links to web-based resources that provide either background information or further elaboration of their topic. A group of students (depending upon size of class, probably 2-3 per topic) will take the lead for each topic, communicating with the speaker and facilitating the class discussion. As a final project, these student groups will also develop a more complete web resource for their selected topic. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22233/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED TOPICS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-831-301", "path": "/courses/22233/sections/301", "id": "22233-301", "aliases": ["NURS-831-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/22233/sections/301/reviews/1911-KATHRYN-H--BOWLES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1911-KATHRYN-H--BOWLES", "first_name": "KATHRYN H.", "last_name": "BOWLES", "id": "1911-KATHRYN-H--BOWLES", "name": "KATHRYN H.
