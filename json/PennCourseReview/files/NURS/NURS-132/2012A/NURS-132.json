One student commented that this class \u201creally challenges you to think as a practitioner and not just a student regurgitating information for an A.\u201d\r\nProfessor Scanga was thanked in the comments for leading such a well-received course; throughout the semester, she was responsive to students\u2019 questions and was able to generate interest in the course material among students.  Students wished the TAs were more involved and more responsive to questions posted on Blackboard.\r\nOverall, students were pleased with this course.  This course pushed students to think outside of the \u201cstudent mindset\u201d and become involved in the material, and general sentiment toward this class was extremely positive.  This class creates a \u201cstrong base and powerful foundation\u201d for subsequent classes.  \r\n", "num_students": 111, "path": "/courses/27868/sections/001/reviews/1637-CONNIE-B--SCANGA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1637-CONNIE-B--SCANGA", "first_name": "CONNIE B.", "last_name": "SCANGA", "id": "1637-CONNIE-B--SCANGA", "name": "CONNIE B.
