the integration and synthesis of scientific knowledge with clinical nursing practice and the development of the professional nursing role. Students will select from a variety of options a primary, secondary or tertiary care setting in which to practice. Students examine nursing care planning and delivery from the standpoint of at least one conceptual model. They increase their skills in patient assessment, planning, and providing the full range of direct and indirect nursing care and evaluating the outcome of care. To the extent that it is possible within the clinical agency, they provide care in more than one patient care delivery setting, to identify how nursing care requirements change as the acuity or the site of care delivery changes. Students will begin to operationalize the professional nursing role and thus are able to apply principles of leadership, accountability and change to clinical practice. This course emphasizes the nurse as a knowledgeable provider of health care who is both a change agent and client advocate.\r\n\r\nStudents generally thought that there was too much \u201cself-study\u201d material and that an \u201cinstructional component\u201d would have been very helpful. The \u201cECG written test was incredibly difficult\u201d from only having read the PowerPoints, according to one student. Regardless, many concurred that the modules were \u201cvery well done.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students found it very helpful when clinical instructors spent even a small amount of time reviewing material and suggested that they should offer \u201cinteractive practice sessions for the ECG model.\u201d Students agreed that it was difficult to do modules without \u201cprofessional collaboration from the instructors.\u201d Some felt that there was not as much \u201cinstructor to instructor variation\u201d as there was with junior year lab. Others noted that there were \u201coffice hours available.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that the online PowerPoints did not sufficiently prepare students, but that the modules themselves were helpful. The majority of students felt that they had to self-teach the material in order to understand it because there was not always direct instruction.\r\n", "num_students": 89, "path": "/courses/23539/sections/201/reviews/4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "first_name": "ANGELA", "last_name": "IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "id": "4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "name": "ANGELA IORIANNI-CIMBAK"}, "num_reviewers": 87, "id": "23539-201-4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-371", "path": "/courses/23539", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23539/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-101", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/101", "id": "23539-101", "aliases": ["NURS-371-101"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: PEDIATRICS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-102", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/102", "id": "23539-102", "aliases": ["NURS-371-102"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: OB CLINICAL PA HOSPITAL", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-103", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/103", "id": "23539-103", "aliases": ["NURS-371-103"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "106", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-106", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/106", "id": "23539-106", "aliases": ["NURS-371-106"]}, {"name": "ADV CLIN PRAC: CLINICAL: ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: PEDS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "107", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-107", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/107", "id": "23539-107", "aliases": ["NURS-371-107"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: OB CLINICAL LANKENAU HOSPITAL", "sectionnum": "108", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-108", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/108", "id": "23539-108", "aliases": ["NURS-371-108"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "109", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-109", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/109", "id": "23539-109", "aliases": ["NURS-371-109"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "111", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-111", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/111", "id": "23539-111", "aliases": ["NURS-371-111"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "113", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-113", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/113", "id": "23539-113", "aliases": ["NURS-371-113"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: PEDIATRICS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "115", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-115", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/115", "id": "23539-115", "aliases": ["NURS-371-115"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "116", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-116", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/116", "id": "23539-116", "aliases": ["NURS-371-116"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "117", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-117", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/117", "id": "23539-117", "aliases": ["NURS-371-117"]}, {"name": "LABORATORY", "sectionnum": "201", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-201", "path": "/courses/23539/sections/201", "id": "23539-201", "aliases": ["NURS-371-201"]}]}, "id": 23539, "aliases": ["NURS-371"]}
