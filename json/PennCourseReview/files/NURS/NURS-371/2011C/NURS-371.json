They will increase their skills in patient assessment, planning, and providing the full range of direct and indirect nursing care and evaluating the outcome of care. To the extent that it is possible within the clinical agency, they will provide care in more than one patient care delivery setting, to identify how nursing care requirements changes as the acuity or the site of care delivery changes. Principles of leadership, accountability and change will be applied to clinical practice as the student begins to operationalize the professional nursing role. Emphasis will be placed on the nurse as a knowledgeable provider of health care who is both a change agent and client advocate. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24874/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "3.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: ADULT HEALTH & ILLNESS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-101", "path": "/courses/24874/sections/101", "id": "24874-101", "aliases": ["NURS-371-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/24874/sections/101/reviews/3119-ELLEN-BEHAN-HEINBOCKEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3119-ELLEN-BEHAN-HEINBOCKEL", "first_name": "ELLEN", "last_name": "BEHAN-HEINBOCKEL", "id": "3119-ELLEN-BEHAN-HEINBOCKEL", "name": "ELLEN BEHAN-HEINBOCKEL"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "24874-101-3119-ELLEN-BEHAN-HEINBOCKEL"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.67", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.86"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: PEDIATRICS CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-102", "path": "/courses/24874/sections/102", "id": "24874-102", "aliases": ["NURS-371-102"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/24874/sections/102/reviews/2616-EILEEN-A-RYAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2616-EILEEN-A-RYAN", "first_name": "EILEEN A", "last_name": "RYAN", "id": "2616-EILEEN-A-RYAN", "name": "EILEEN A RYAN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "24874-102-2616-EILEEN-A-RYAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.43", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.78"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: OB CLINICAL PA HOSPITAL", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-371-103", "path": "/courses/24874/sections/103", "id": "24874-103", "aliases": ["NURS-371-103"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/24874/sections/103/reviews/2617-ROSEMARY-J--GILLESPIE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2617-ROSEMARY-J--GILLESPIE", "first_name": "ROSEMARY J.", "last_name": "GILLESPIE", "id": "2617-ROSEMARY-J--GILLESPIE", "name": "ROSEMARY J.
