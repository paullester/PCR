The influence of individual characteristics on health promotion, health behaviors, population cancer risk, and cancer detection are explored in the context of biological, psychological, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors across age groups from adolescents to older adults. Evidence-based practice guidelines and research are applied to promote healthy lifestyles, monitor cancer risk, address psychosocial issues, facilitate access to care, and reduce health care disparities for populations at risk and diagnosed with cancer, and cancer survivors. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "THE CONTINUUM OF CANCER CARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12714/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "THE CONTINUUM OF CANCER CARE", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "NURS-664-920", "path": "/courses/12714/sections/920", "id": "12714-920", "aliases": ["NURS-664-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/12714/sections/920/reviews/906-ARLENE-HOULDIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/906-ARLENE-HOULDIN", "first_name": "ARLENE", "last_name": "HOULDIN", "id": "906-ARLENE-HOULDIN", "name": "ARLENE HOULDIN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "12714-920-906-ARLENE-HOULDIN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.17", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.17", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "THE CONTINUUM OF CANCER CARE", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "NURS-664-920", "path": "/courses/12714/sections/920", "id": "12714-920", "aliases": ["NURS-664-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/12714/sections/920/reviews/908-GENEVIEVE-HOLLIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/908-GENEVIEVE-HOLLIS", "first_name": "GENEVIEVE", "last_name": "HOLLIS", "id": "908-GENEVIEVE-HOLLIS", "name": "GENEVIEVE HOLLIS"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "12714-920-908-GENEVIEVE-HOLLIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-664", "path": "/courses/12714", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12714/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE CONTINUUM OF CANCER CARE", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "NURS-664-920", "path": "/courses/12714/sections/920", "id": "12714-920", "aliases": ["NURS-664-920"]}]}, "id": 12714, "aliases": ["NURS-664"]}
