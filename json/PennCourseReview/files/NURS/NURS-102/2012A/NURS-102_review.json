NURS 102 fosters development of the professional role and sets the stage for life-long learning.\r\nA majority of students found this class difficult to enjoy because of the amount of work required for only .5 credits.  Instead of reflecting on the content, students were distracted by the excessive amount of work required.  Students concluded that this class \u201ceither needs to have less work or more credit.\u201d  A lot of work for this class was done outside of the classroom and students wish to have their time commitments recognized.  This is the \u201cfirst time that this class was taught\u201d which irritated students because \u201cit seemed like this was used as an excuse quite a bit to explain many issues with clarity, with instructions, and other issues with the class.\u201d\r\nProfessor Brewer was strict when it came to deadlines for students, but when she handed work back she managed to make deadline exceptions for herself.  There was also a lack of clarity when Professor Brewer tried to explain assignments or readings.\r\nStudents completed three essays as well as some projects.  They found the project assignments most interesting.
