{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5142"}, "description": "This graduate course is an advanced exploration of biometric methods (branch of science that includes the measurement of physiological variables and parameters) and their use in quantitative research. A particular focus will be on biological measures that can be used as outcome variables to evaluate interventions to promote health and health equity, and reduce health outcome disparities in vulnerable or marginalized populations. \n\nAreas to be evaluated include: * Measurement theory and instrument science as they relate to biological signals; role of biometrics in health outcome disparities research * Ethical considerations and how they relate to biometrics; mitigating perceived threats (profiling, stereotyping); the role of human subjects considerations; the responsible conduct of research * Derivation and types of biologic signals; time-based characteristics * Accuracy and precision of biologic measures; random and non-random error; application and exemplars of strategies to determine accuracy and precision * Role of biological rhythms in biometric measurement; analysis of multiple data points and repeated measures of biological variables * Methods relative to vulnerable women, children, and families: genetics; environmental contaminants; digital image analysis; hormones, metabolites; drugs and alcohol \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MEASUREMENT OF PHYSIOLOGIC VARIABLES RELATED TO HEALTH OUTCOME DISPARITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23589/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.22", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "3.11", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "MEASUREMENT OF PHYSIOLOGIC VARIABLES RELATED TO HEALTH OUTCOME DISPARITY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-829-301", "path": "/courses/23589/sections/301", "id": "23589-301", "aliases": ["NURS-829-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/23589/sections/301/reviews/3439-MARILYN-S--SOMMERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3439-MARILYN-S--SOMMERS", "first_name": "MARILYN S.", "last_name": "SOMMERS", "id": "3439-MARILYN-S--SOMMERS", "name": "MARILYN S.
