{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3196"}, "description": "This course is an in-depth analysis of the chemical and physical principles as they apply to nurse anesthesia practice. Aspects of organic and biochemistry including the chemical structures of compounds and its significance in pharmacology will be explored. Applications of the laws of physics as they pertain to nurse anesthesia practice will be reviewed with specific examples. Emphasis on the dynamics of the anesthesia delivery system and related equipment will be presented. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "APPLIED SCIENCES RELATED TO ANESTHESIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30780/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.47", "rDifficulty": "3.21", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.47", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "3.07", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.87", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.14", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "APPLIED SCIENCES RELATED TO ANESTHESIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-683-001", "path": "/courses/30780/sections/001", "id": "30780-001", "aliases": ["NURS-683-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/30780/sections/001/reviews/3445-LORIANN-WINNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3445-LORIANN-WINNER", "first_name": "LORIANN", "last_name": "WINNER", "id": "3445-LORIANN-WINNER", "name": "LORIANN WINNER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30780-001-3445-LORIANN-WINNER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.47", "rDifficulty": "3.21", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.93", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "3.07", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.87", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.14", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "APPLIED SCIENCES RELATED TO ANESTHESIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-683-001", "path": "/courses/30780/sections/001", "id": "30780-001", "aliases": ["NURS-683-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/30780/sections/001/reviews/4949-DAWN-E-BENT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4949-DAWN-E-BENT", "first_name": "DAWN E", "last_name": "BENT", "id": "4949-DAWN-E-BENT", "name": "DAWN E BENT"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "30780-001-4949-DAWN-E-BENT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-683", "path": "/courses/30780", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30780/sections", "values": [{"name": "APPLIED SCIENCES RELATED TO ANESTHESIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-683-001", "path": "/courses/30780/sections/001", "id": "30780-001", "aliases": ["NURS-683-001"]}]}, "id": 30780, "aliases": ["NURS-683"]}
