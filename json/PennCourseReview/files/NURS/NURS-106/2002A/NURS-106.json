{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/799"}, "description": "This course focuses on health promotion and disease prevention across the health-illness continuum for healthy and at risk individuals in the community. Students build on their previously mastered communication techniques and clinical skills to develop comprehensive assessment skills and to define needs among specific at risk groups in a family and community context. \n\nIn weekly seminars, students integrate theories of behavior and health, epidemiologic principles, clinical decision making, and critical thinking skills. Theories are applied utilizing case studies and data sources to develop health promotion and disease prevention strategies. A key component of the course is the development of communication and physical assessment skills and specified clinical techniques. The influence of gender, life span, culture, race, and ethnicity on health promotion and disease prevention is specifically addressed throughout the course. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "CONCEPTS IN NURSING: PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFE STYLES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/799/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.41", "rDifficulty": "2.85", "rStimulateInterest": "3.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "2.96", "rWorkRequired": "3.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.89", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.96", "rCommAbility": "3.37", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "CONCEPTS IN NURSING: PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFE STYLES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-106-001", "path": "/courses/799/sections/001", "id": "799-001", "aliases": ["NURS-106-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/799/sections/001/reviews/869-JULIE-A--FAIRMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/869-JULIE-A--FAIRMAN", "first_name": "JULIE A.", "last_name": "FAIRMAN", "id": "869-JULIE-A--FAIRMAN", "name": "JULIE A.
