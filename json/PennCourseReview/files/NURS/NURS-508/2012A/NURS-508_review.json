They occasionally felt overwhelmed by the material, but were able to recognize the purpose it served.  The majority of students thought this class presented extremely \u201cimportant information\u201d and that it should have been taught over the course of two semesters.  A guest speaker who covered the Endocrine system was particularly memorable and a popular favorite.  Despite the usefulness of the information, many students were not satisfied with their grasps of the information and felt \u201cunprepared\u201d to apply the material in clinical settings.\r\nDr. Boullata was \u201cstimulating and engaging\u201d and presented the material well.\r\nThere were only two exams in this course and students found this frustrating.  They felt that administering a third or even fourth exam would split up the material more effectively and allow a more constant study schedule.
