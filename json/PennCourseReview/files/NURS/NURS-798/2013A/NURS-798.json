{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5581"}, "description": "This online didactic course and accompanying clinical fieldwork focuses on issues essential to the implementation of the role of the Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner. Clinical fieldwork focuses on the unique assessment, diagnosis, management and evaluation of acutely, critically and complex chronically-ill adults, across the adult age continuum, experiencing acute, urgent and emergent conditions, using both physiologically and technologically derived data. Evaluating for physiologic instability and potential life-threatening conditions is emphasized. Attention is given to the typical and atypical presentation of syndromes and constellation of symptoms exhibited by adults and older adults experiencing complex acute, critical and complex chronic illness. Issues related to the transition of patients through the health care system are explored. Collaboration between the nurse practitioner, patient, family and interprofessional healthcare team are encouraged. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "PROFESSIONAL ROLE & CLINICAL PRACTICUM FOR PRIMARY CARE PREPARED PROVIDERS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30804/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "PROFESSIONAL ROLE & CLINICAL PRACTICUM FOR PRIMARY CARE PREPARED PROVIDERS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-798-001", "path": "/courses/30804/sections/001", "id": "30804-001", "aliases": ["NURS-798-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/30804/sections/001/reviews/4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART", "first_name": "HEIDI B", "last_name": "ELGART", "id": "4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART", "name": "HEIDI B ELGART"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "30804-001-4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "3.67", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-798-101", "path": "/courses/30804/sections/101", "id": "30804-101", "aliases": ["NURS-798-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/30804/sections/101/reviews/3864-ANGELA-M-VOTODIAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3864-ANGELA-M-VOTODIAN", "first_name": "ANGELA M", "last_name": "VOTODIAN", "id": "3864-ANGELA-M-VOTODIAN", "name": "ANGELA M VOTODIAN"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "30804-101-3864-ANGELA-M-VOTODIAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-798", "path": "/courses/30804", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30804/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROFESSIONAL ROLE & CLINICAL PRACTICUM FOR PRIMARY CARE PREPARED PROVIDERS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-798-001", "path": "/courses/30804/sections/001", "id": "30804-001", "aliases": ["NURS-798-001"]}, {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-798-101", "path": "/courses/30804/sections/101", "id": "30804-101", "aliases": ["NURS-798-101"]}]}, "id": 30804, "aliases": ["NURS-798"]}
