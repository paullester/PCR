{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3198"}, "description": "This course provides the opportunity for students to integrate theoretical knowledge and research finding into practice within the clinical setting. Students progress by providing anesthesia care for patients with more complex health problems. Techniques for managing the acute pain of clients are emphasized. Anesthetic requirements as dictated by patient assessment including the surgical procedure are studied in greater depth. The student now possesses the ability to combine theories and skills in selected clinical situations. The guidance of CRNA faculty preceptors contributes to the development of the student's critical thinking. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "CLINIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16259/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-792-101", "path": "/courses/16259/sections/101", "id": "16259-101", "aliases": ["NURS-792-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/16259/sections/101/reviews/3129-RUSSELL-LYNN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3129-RUSSELL-LYNN", "first_name": "RUSSELL", "last_name": "LYNN", "id": "3129-RUSSELL-LYNN", "name": "RUSSELL LYNN"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "16259-101-3129-RUSSELL-LYNN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-792", "path": "/courses/16259", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16259/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-792-101", "path": "/courses/16259/sections/101", "id": "16259-101", "aliases": ["NURS-792-101"]}]}, "id": 16259, "aliases": ["NURS-792"]}
