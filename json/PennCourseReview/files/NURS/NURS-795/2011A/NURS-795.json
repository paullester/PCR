{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3199"}, "description": "This course is the second of two residencies that provide the nurse anesthetist student the opportunity to attain competencies within the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthesia (CRNA) scope of practice. Throughout the residency, the nurse anesthesia resident will utilize appropriate clinical judgment to manage the complex medical, physical and psychosocial needs of clients in the perioperative phases. Further refinement of the patient assessment, anesthesia administration, and critical thinking skills is emphasized. Students progress by providing anesthesia care for patients throughout the continuum of health care services. The guidance of CRNA faculty preceptors contributes to the development of the independence of the CRNA student. Collaborative practice within a care team model is emphasized and the student assumes more overall responsibility for the quality of care for the patients throughout the perioperative experience, with clinical support as required. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "CLINIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22226/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "3.39", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-101", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101", "id": "22226-101", "aliases": ["NURS-795-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101/reviews/3445-LORIANN-WINNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3445-LORIANN-WINNER", "first_name": "LORIANN", "last_name": "WINNER", "id": "3445-LORIANN-WINNER", "name": "LORIANN WINNER"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "22226-101-3445-LORIANN-WINNER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.39", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "3.28", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-101", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101", "id": "22226-101", "aliases": ["NURS-795-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101/reviews/4696-DONNA-WARGO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4696-DONNA-WARGO", "first_name": "DONNA", "last_name": "WARGO", "id": "4696-DONNA-WARGO", "name": "DONNA WARGO"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "22226-101-4696-DONNA-WARGO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "3.76", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-101", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101", "id": "22226-101", "aliases": ["NURS-795-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101/reviews/4948-MATTHEW-S-MCCOY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4948-MATTHEW-S-MCCOY", "first_name": "MATTHEW S", "last_name": "MCCOY", "id": "4948-MATTHEW-S-MCCOY", "name": "MATTHEW S MCCOY"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "22226-101-4948-MATTHEW-S-MCCOY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39", "rReadingsValue": "3.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-101", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101", "id": "22226-101", "aliases": ["NURS-795-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101/reviews/5496-COLLEEN-M-COSTICK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5496-COLLEEN-M-COSTICK", "first_name": "COLLEEN M", "last_name": "COSTICK", "id": "5496-COLLEEN-M-COSTICK", "name": "COLLEEN M COSTICK"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "22226-101-5496-COLLEEN-M-COSTICK"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.28", "rDifficulty": "2.94", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.61", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.94", "rCommAbility": "3.39", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "NURSE ANESTHESIA RESIDENCY II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-301", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/301", "id": "22226-301", "aliases": ["NURS-795-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/22226/sections/301/reviews/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "MAGRO", "id": "3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "name": "MARIA MAGRO"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "22226-301-3128-MARIA-MAGRO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-795", "path": "/courses/22226", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22226/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-101", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/101", "id": "22226-101", "aliases": ["NURS-795-101"]}, {"name": "NURSE ANESTHESIA RESIDENCY II", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-795-301", "path": "/courses/22226/sections/301", "id": "22226-301", "aliases": ["NURS-795-301"]}]}, "id": 22226, "aliases": ["NURS-795"]}
