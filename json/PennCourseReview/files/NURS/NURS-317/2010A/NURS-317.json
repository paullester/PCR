{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5008"}, "description": "This course provides a critical and reality based approach to the complex phenomenon of migration and its impact on health. It includes an overview of the current knowledge about immigration trends, push- pull factors, culturally based health beliefs, health risks, health status, and protective factors among migrant families across the lifespan. The availability of health care resources at the local, state, and federal level for students interested in societal factors affecting health care will be critiqued. Current bi-national health initiatives, public policieand legislation developed to plan migrant health care, promote healthy behaviors, maintain border security, and reduce health risks for the migrant farm worker family will also be examined within a social justice framework. The migrant farm worker stream (Western, Midwestern, Pacific Northwest, and Eastern) from Mexico to communities in the United States will serve as an exemplar of international family migration. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "MIGRATION AND HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26494/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.25", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "MIGRATION AND HEALTH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-317-001", "path": "/courses/26494/sections/001", "id": "26494-001", "aliases": ["NURS-317-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/26494/sections/001/reviews/5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ", "first_name": "MARY L", "last_name": "SIANTZ", "id": "5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ", "name": "MARY L SIANTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "26494-001-5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "MIGRATION AND HEALTH FIELD REQUIREMENT", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-317-101", "path": "/courses/26494/sections/101", "id": "26494-101", "aliases": ["NURS-317-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/26494/sections/101/reviews/5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ", "first_name": "MARY L", "last_name": "SIANTZ", "id": "5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ", "name": "MARY L SIANTZ"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "26494-101-5478-MARY-L-SIANTZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-317", "path": "/courses/26494", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26494/sections", "values": [{"name": "MIGRATION AND HEALTH", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-317-001", "path": "/courses/26494/sections/001", "id": "26494-001", "aliases": ["NURS-317-001"]}, {"name": "MIGRATION AND HEALTH FIELD REQUIREMENT", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-317-101", "path": "/courses/26494/sections/101", "id": "26494-101", "aliases": ["NURS-317-101"]}]}, "id": 26494, "aliases": ["NURS-317"]}
