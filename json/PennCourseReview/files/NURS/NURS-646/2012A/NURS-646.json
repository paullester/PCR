Some aspects of the work were informative, but the quality was overlooked due to the quantity.\r\nProfessor Bryan gave clear lectures, but lacked clarity when it came to major assignments.\r\nThe majority of students felt that the State of Science paper was difficult, tedious, and overwhelming.  Because of a lack of guidance, many students spent superfluous amounts of time dealing with formatting and rewriting, which sparked irritation.  They wished more time could have been dedicated to research.  Prerequisite: NURS 657.
