A detailed scholarly paper in APA format will be written by the student.\r\nThis course was seen as difficult, but students appreciated that they were able to tailor the class and personalize it based on their research goals.  Working with advisors whom had previous experience in the field allowed the students to gain a lot from the course, although sometimes the work bordered on \u201cbusy work.\u201d  A few students wished the course placed more emphasis on the research element from the beginning of the course, but overall found it to be \u201cbeneficial\u201d and \u201cvaluable.\u201d\r\nDr. Lake was viewed favorably among students because she let students chose their own topics.  However, some students thought a little more guidance would have been useful.  Each of the assigned advisors had their own style and timetable, but overall each was viewed as an integral part to the course.\r\nCourse assignments were generally due Friday nights, which was seen as inconvenient to a few students.  Much of the work fell toward the second half of the semester and was considered \u201cstressful and tough for only 0.5 CU.\u201d  Prerequisites for this course are NURS 321, 322, 340, and 341 or permission of advisor and Instructor.\r\n", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/27887/sections/001/reviews/2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "first_name": "EILEEN", "last_name": "LAKE", "id": "2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "name": "EILEEN LAKE"}, "num_reviewers": 75, "id": "27887-001-2235-EILEEN-LAKE"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.20", "rDifficulty": "1.80", "rTAQuality": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "1.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.20", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SENIOR INQUIRY: HONORS INQUIRY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-385-301", "path": "/courses/27887/sections/301", "id": "27887-301", "aliases": ["NURS-385-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/27887/sections/301/reviews/2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "first_name": "EILEEN", "last_name": "LAKE", "id": "2235-EILEEN-LAKE", "name": "EILEEN LAKE"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "27887-301-2235-EILEEN-LAKE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-385", "path": "/courses/27887", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27887/sections", "values": [{"name": "SENIOR INQUIRY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-385-001", "path": "/courses/27887/sections/001", "id": "27887-001", "aliases": ["NURS-385-001"]}, {"name": "SENIOR INQUIRY: HONORS INQUIRY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-385-301", "path": "/courses/27887/sections/301", "id": "27887-301", "aliases": ["NURS-385-301"]}]}, "id": 27887, "aliases": ["NURS-385"]}
