The initiation of health promotion & health maintenance activities with individuals and groups is stressed. This class includes 16 hours a week of clinical experience with a preceptor.\r\n\tThis course centers heavily on active student involvement in group discussions and clinical exercises. Case studies are assigned twice a week and require synthesis across lecture and clinical materials. The clinical component of the course was described as a great learning opportunity and students considered the variety of sites a \u201cwonderful balance.\u201d \r\n\tStudents did not comment on the professor for this course, Dr. Treston. However, students did comment on the clinical instructors and their role. In particular, student response to Professors Katzenbach and Bryan were overwhelmingly positive. Students appreciated the flexibility of the instructors and found them to be extremely \u201cencouraging\u201d in the clinical setting and in regards to the difficult course work. \r\n\tMany students emphasized the time intensive nature of the case studies assigned each week. These studies were described as requiring as many as 8-12 hours to complete, making the class very \u201cstressful\u201d and \u201ctime consuming.\u201d Beyond the demanding classwork, students saw the grading as relatively \u201cinconsistent\u201d and often \u201charsh,\u201d adding an additional level of difficulty to the course. However, despite the challenge presented by the course, students found it worthwhile. This is an upper level course, which requires not only the prerequisite of NURS 657, but also a corequisite of NURS 646. \r\n", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/27914/sections/101/reviews/2290-JUNE-A--TRESTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2290-JUNE-A--TRESTON", "first_name": "JUNE A.", "last_name": "TRESTON", "id": "2290-JUNE-A--TRESTON", "name": "JUNE A.
