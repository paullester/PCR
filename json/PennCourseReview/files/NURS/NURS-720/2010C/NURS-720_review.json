This course emphasizes current research and issues in child and family development and functioning.\r\n\r\nMany students \u201cenjoyed\u201d this \u201cinteresting\u201d course; some called it \u201cexcellent\u201d or a \u201cfavorite course.\u201d The content was \u201corganized\u201d and \u201cwell-planned.\u201d A few commented that the material could sometimes be \u201cdry.\u201d One student remarked that \u201cthe second half of the course was awesome\u201d and that she liked being able to discuss \u201ctopics that are traditionally taboo,\u201d as many nursing schools do not include them in their curriculums. \r\n\r\nStudents generally liked the \u201cintegration of guest speakers\u201d and felt that it added to the \u201cspecialty lectures.\u201d However, there was the occasional guest lecturer that was \u201cnot engaging and just read off the slides,\u201d noted one student.

Many students felt that \"it will be very useful in clinical practice\" and is \"extremely relevant to health care,\" insisting that it \"should be required for all nursing students.\" The class seemed to be difficult in the sense that lectures varied in structure and \"content material was in-depth,\" as well as the fact that they were not given \"feedback with each project or paper before the new next project was due.\"\r\n", "num_students": 104, "path": "/courses/23571/sections/001/reviews/913-KATHRYN-M-MURPHY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/913-KATHRYN-M-MURPHY", "first_name": "KATHRYN M", "last_name": "MURPHY", "id": "913-KATHRYN-M-MURPHY", "name": "KATHRYN M MURPHY"}, "num_reviewers": 99, "id": "23571-001-913-KATHRYN-M-MURPHY"}]
