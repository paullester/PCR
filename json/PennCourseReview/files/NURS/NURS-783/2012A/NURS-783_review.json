Content includes theory and practice related to nurse-midwifery/ nurse practitioner management of the normal pregnant woman, and nurse-midwifery/ nurse practitioner management and strategies to reduce selected obstetric complications.\r\n\tStudents generally enjoyed this class, though many felt frustrated with the structure and priorities of the course.  Many felt that certain topics should have been given more or less attention, and that the objectives of the class were misleading in terms of what the class actually covered.  Overall, the course was seen as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cinformational,\u201d but with \u201croom for improvement.\u201d  Students stressed the lack of class material presented online and the lack of lectures on diabetes and cardiac care as their faults with the class.\r\n\tThis course was led by Dr. Lewis along with numerous guest lecturers.  Lewis was seen as favorable and the lecturers were \u201cexperienced\u201d and \u201cvery good.\u201d However, each guest lecturer brought his or her own teaching style, which didn\u2019t necessarily mesh with the style of the course.\r\n\tThis course requires an intensive time commitment from the students, as case studies and assignments require a lot of time preparing outside of class.  Students lamented the absence of feedback on assignments but referred to the class as an overall \u201cgreat course.\u201d  Prerequisites for the course are NURS 781 and 782, with a corequisite of NURS 784.  \r\n", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/27943/sections/001/reviews/3139-JANET-L--LEWIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3139-JANET-L--LEWIS", "first_name": "JANET L.", "last_name": "LEWIS", "id": "3139-JANET-L--LEWIS", "name": "JANET L.
