Histologic and gross anatomical features of selected organ systems are related to the physiologic and biochemical mechanisms which enable the human body to maintain homeostasis in an ever-changing environment.\r\n\r\nThis course does not seem to be for the light-hearted student. Although students warned that, \u201cYou need to mentally prepare for this course\u201d because of an overwhelming workload and \"massive amounts of information,\" the overall consensus was that the outcome was definitely worth the effort. One student claimed that the course, \u201cforced me to change the way I study for science classes in general.\u201d Despite the demanding nature of this course, students thoroughly enjoyed it and gained from it. One student even referred to this course as, \u201cthe most pleasant experience of my nursing career thus far.\u201d Students described this course as purely exam based and very heavy on memorization. The course content, although vast, is imperative and essential. Dr. Scanga facilitates this course in a way that students admit to learning the material in a \u201cdeep way\u201d that they will remember as they continue in their nursing careers.\r\n\r\nStudents give overwhelming praise for Dr. Scanga. One student referred to her as an \u201cabsolute asset to Penn Nursing.\u201d Students were unable to deny Dr. Scanga\u2019s enthusiasm for and love of Anatomy and Physiology and her dedication to the success of her students.

Dr. Scanga is noted for answering e-mails promptly, eagerly discussing content outside of class, being available for students who are having difficulties, and getting to know every single student by name. Students constantly use the words \u201canimated,\u201d \u201ccompassionate,\u201d and \u201centertaining\u201d when referring to Dr. Scanga. She is referred to as \u201cThe most organized professor I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Dr. Scanga provides students with study questions, lecture outlines, and online resources which the majority of students find really facilitate their learning.\r\n\r\nThis course is said to be extremely valuable for all individuals who are planning to be a health care professional.
