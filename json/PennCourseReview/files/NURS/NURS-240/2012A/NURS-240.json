Comments regarding the numerous guest lecturers were varied; some were described as \u201cgreat\u201d and others as \u201chorrible.\u201d \r\n\tMany students commented on the overwhelming amount of material covered on the exams. Many felt the tests were \u201ccrammed\u201d with information and that not all of the information was consistent with the lecture material. Furthermore, many found the class to be time intensive as assignments and exam prep were extensive.
