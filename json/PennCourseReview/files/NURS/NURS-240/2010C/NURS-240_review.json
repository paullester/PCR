The course presents a comprehensive overview of functional status impairments, developmental concerns, assessment parameters, common health problems, treatment modalities, nutritional interventions, nursing care strategies, resources and barriers to treatment, psychosocial needs as well as ethical and cultural considerations. Clinical application of content covered occurs in an acute care hospital setting. Students care for young and middle aged adults recovering from illness and injury and participate in one observational experience which may include the operating room/post-anesthesia care unit, pain experience team, hemodialysis, transplant team, HIV outpatient experience or ostomy experience. Guest speakers are a major part of the course introducing various topics. There is also a strong clinical portion to the course requiring much preparation.\r\n\r\nOverall, students deemed this an enjoyable course. Many thought that it was \u201cvery informative,\u201d felt that they gained \u201cgreat clinical skills,\u201d and believed that it helped prepare them for a career in nursing. The class had a strong clinical aspect and many students reported to the hospital for fifteen hours each week. The main complaint regarded the difficulty of tests, which many students described as having confusing questions that did not always match the lectures. Overall though, the reviews were positive.\r\n\r\nProfessor Walsh Brennan\u2019s lectures were, according to many students, sometimes \u201cconfusing\u201d and a bit \u201cscattered.\u201d Some students stated that often times Professor Walsh Brennan became frustrated with questions. However, many students reported that she was always available after and outside of class for questions. Several complained that too much information was placed in each lecture and it became overwhelming. One student commented, \u201c Professor Walsh Brennan is very willing to help answer questions and is very organized, but her lectures are very dry.\u201d Another noted that she \u201cdid a great job of being available for student questions before and after class, during exams, with office hours, and after tests for review. This type of instructor accessibility provides important student support and was one of the best parts of the course for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nDue to the intensive clinical aspect of this course, students noted that the class was very time intensive. Also, many felt that the grading was tough. Some students noted that tests were difficult and took much studying effort; however, students were given a paper alternative to a test, which in some cases helped improve grades. This course has numerous prerequisites including: NURS 104, 106, 131, and 132.\r\n", "num_students": 90, "path": "/courses/23523/sections/001/reviews/1638-ANN-MARIE-WALSH-BRENNAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1638-ANN-MARIE-WALSH-BRENNAN", "first_name": "ANN MARIE", "last_name": "WALSH BRENNAN", "id": "1638-ANN-MARIE-WALSH-BRENNAN", "name": "ANN MARIE WALSH BRENNAN"}, "num_reviewers": 75, "id": "23523-001-1638-ANN-MARIE-WALSH-BRENNAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "3.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.49", "rRecommendMajor": "3.45", "rCourseQuality": "2.76", "rWorkRequired": "3.48", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.53", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.61"}, "section": {"name": "NURSING CARE OF YOUNG & MIDDLE AGED ADULT: THEORY/CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-001", "path": "/courses/23523/sections/001", "id": "23523-001", "aliases": ["NURS-240-001"]}, "comments": "The four central themes of nursing (person, environment, health and nursing) will form the basis for an exploration of the health and illness related issues facing young and middle aged adults.

One student noted that her \u201cknowledge base has expanded\u201d and another \u201cappreciated the overall quality\u201d of this course. However, the most consistent complaint was the amount of information crammed in such a short amount of time. One student suggested that this course be extended to a full semester rather than half of a semester. Several students noted that the information was rushed and that there was not enough time for instructors to explain the material and for students to process the information. One student described the pace of the course as \u201cvery frustrating.\u201d Students also criticized the clinical settings and validations as being \u201cdisorganized.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn this course, several lecturers rotated instructing. There were many criticisms of these guest lecturers. Most students criticized that the instructors moved far too fast. Further, some students added that lecturers did not understand the students\u2019 level of knowledge and over-assumed understanding of concepts. One student offered, \u201cTeachers did not lecture at a pace or us[e] language that was appropriate.\u201d Further, some students reported that most instructors taught the information directly off the slides. Several students did commend the study guide review sessions as helpful.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites to this course include NURS 104, 106, 131, and 132. This course is a requirement for nursing students in the fall or spring semester of their junior year and would be inappropriate for non-nursing students. A few students described NURS 240 001 as \u201ca very challenging course.\u201d Many students referred to the tests as \u201ctricky\u201d and \u201cdifficult.\u201d Another student regarded the grade breakdown as \u201cnot representative of where the majority of the work is done\u201d because time-consuming assignments were not weighed heavily.\r\n", "num_students": 90, "path":
