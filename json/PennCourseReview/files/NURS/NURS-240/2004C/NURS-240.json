{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/804"}, "description": "The four central themes of nursing (person, environment, health and nursing) will form the basis for an exploration of the health and illness related issues facing young and middle aged adults. A functional status conceptual framework encompassing a biopsychosocial approach to nursing practice will be used. The course will present a comprehensive overview of functional status impairments, developmental concerns, assessment parameters, common health problems, treatment modalities, nutritional interventions, nursing care strategies, resources and barriers to treatment, psychosocial needs as well as ethical and cultural considerations. Clinical application of content covered will occur in an acute care hospital setting. \n\nStudents will care for young and middle aged adults recovering from illness and injury and participate in one observational experience which may include the operating room/post-anesthesia care unit, pain experience team, hemodialysis, transplant team, HIV outpatient experience or ostomy experience. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "NURSING CARE OF YOUNG & MIDDLE AGED ADULT: THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5651/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-240", "path": "/courses/5651", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5651/sections", "values": [{"name": "NURSING CARE OF YOUNG & MIDDLE AGED ADULT: THEORY", "sectionnum": "010", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-010", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/010", "id": "5651-010", "aliases": ["NURS-240-010"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: SILVERSTEIN 11", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-101", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/101", "id": "5651-101", "aliases": ["NURS-240-101"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: SILVERSTEIN 10", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-102", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/102", "id": "5651-102", "aliases": ["NURS-240-102"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: PRESBYTERIAN 3E", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-103", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/103", "id": "5651-103", "aliases": ["NURS-240-103"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: PRESBYTERIAN 3S", "sectionnum": "104", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-104", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/104", "id": "5651-104", "aliases": ["NURS-240-104"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: RHOADS 3", "sectionnum": "105", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-105", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/105", "id": "5651-105", "aliases": ["NURS-240-105"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: FOUNDERS 12", "sectionnum": "106", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-106", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/106", "id": "5651-106", "aliases": ["NURS-240-106"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: FOUNDERS 14", "sectionnum": "107", "primary_alias": "NURS-240-107", "path": "/courses/5651/sections/107", "id": "5651-107", "aliases": ["NURS-240-107"]}]}, "id": 5651, "aliases": ["NURS-240"]}
