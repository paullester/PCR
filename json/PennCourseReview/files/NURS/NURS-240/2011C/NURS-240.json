The grade is based on participation as\r\nwell as tests that feature NCLEX style test questions. The textbook was described as\r\n\u201cexcellent\u201d and the lectures as \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and worthwhile. Often guest lecturers\r\nwere involved to present course material.\r\nThe various instructors that co-taught the course were described as \u201chelpful\u201d and\r\n\u201cinformative.\u201d Students made a conscious effort to develop relationships with the\r\ninstructors, because grades depended partially on participation.\r\nThis course has quite a comprehensive workload. Besides the time commitment\r\nassociated with the clinical aspect, a great deal of preparation before each clinical session\r\nwas required. Students often had a significant amount of reading and found the tests to be\r\ndifficult. Many felt unprepared for the NCLEX questions.
