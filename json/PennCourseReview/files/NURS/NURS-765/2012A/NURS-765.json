This class also spends time revolving around discussion which some students found helpful, while others wished for a larger portion of content lectures.  The majority of the guest speakers were engaging and their presentations were highly valued.\r\nProfessor Becker let some class discussions wander for longer than most students would like.  The discussions were interesting, but occasionally lacking in relevance.\r\nThis class was not exceedingly difficult, but required preparation for clinicals.  Prerequisite: NURS 764.

While discussions were stimulating, they were not as informative as some of the lectures (two students raved about the critical incidents presentation in particular) and clinicals, which students found very helpful but too few in number.\r\n\r\nStudents were relatively neutral regarding Professor Griffith but implied that she could have done a better job in structuring and running the course. One student complained that class never started on time, and another added that the time left was not spent well, as content was lacking.\r\n\r\nThis course is intended for students in the nurse
