{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4743"}, "description": "This course is an advanced seminar for research and scholarship to be taken by honors students in nursing. Enrollment is concurrent with implementation of the individual student's honors project. Practical considerations in carrying out such a project, including scholarly approach and scientific integrity as well as scholarly writing and dissemination will be discussed and illustrated, using exemplars and student projects. The various phases of students' projects will be used as launching points for discussions and to complement students' work with their faculty supervisors. Paths and planning for careers in nursing and related disciplines and the idea of scholarship and research trajectories will be developed throughout the course. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "NURSING HONORS RESEARCH PROJECT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23542/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.60", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "NURSING HONORS RESEARCH PROJECT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-386-301", "path": "/courses/23542/sections/301", "id": "23542-301", "aliases": ["NURS-386-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/23542/sections/301/reviews/876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN", "first_name": "SARAH HOPE", "last_name": "KAGAN", "id": "876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN", "name": "SARAH HOPE KAGAN"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "23542-301-876-SARAH-HOPE-KAGAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "1.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.60", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "NURSING HONORS RESEARCH PROJECT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-386-301", "path": "/courses/23542/sections/301", "id": "23542-301", "aliases": ["NURS-386-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/23542/sections/301/reviews/880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY", "first_name": "KATHLEEN", "last_name": "MCCAULEY", "id": "880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY", "name": "KATHLEEN MCCAULEY"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "23542-301-880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-386", "path": "/courses/23542", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23542/sections", "values": [{"name": "NURSING HONORS RESEARCH PROJECT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NURS-386-301", "path": "/courses/23542/sections/301", "id": "23542-301", "aliases": ["NURS-386-301"]}]}, "id": 23542, "aliases": ["NURS-386"]}
