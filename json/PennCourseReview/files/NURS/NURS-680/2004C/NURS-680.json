{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2365"}, "description": "This course should be taken in the last semester of the Occupational Health Nursing Program. As such, it is meant to provide opportunity for the students to focus upon the occupational health setting, integrate course work and test their roles in occupational health in concert with an experienced colleague. Whenever possible, team assignments will be made for administration/consultation option and primary care options students so they can act in complimentary roles in the residency. Selected seminars are included to focus discussion and learning on health problems and concerns in occupational health. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "CLINIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5694/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-680-101", "path": "/courses/5694/sections/101", "id": "5694-101", "aliases": ["NURS-680-101"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/5694/sections/101/reviews/2289-KAY-ARENDASKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2289-KAY-ARENDASKY", "first_name": "KAY", "last_name": "ARENDASKY", "id": "2289-KAY-ARENDASKY", "name": "KAY ARENDASKY"}, "num_reviewers": 1, "id": "5694-101-2289-KAY-ARENDASKY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED PRACTICUM/RESIDENCY IN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH", "sectionnum": "201", "primary_alias": "NURS-680-201", "path": "/courses/5694/sections/201", "id": "5694-201", "aliases": ["NURS-680-201"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/5694/sections/201/reviews/2289-KAY-ARENDASKY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2289-KAY-ARENDASKY", "first_name": "KAY", "last_name": "ARENDASKY", "id": "2289-KAY-ARENDASKY", "name": "KAY ARENDASKY"}, "num_reviewers": 1, "id": "5694-201-2289-KAY-ARENDASKY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-680", "path": "/courses/5694", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5694/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-680-101", "path": "/courses/5694/sections/101", "id": "5694-101", "aliases": ["NURS-680-101"]}, {"name": "ADVANCED PRACTICUM/RESIDENCY IN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH", "sectionnum": "201", "primary_alias": "NURS-680-201", "path": "/courses/5694/sections/201", "id": "5694-201", "aliases": ["NURS-680-201"]}]}, "id": 5694, "aliases": ["NURS-680"]}
