The residency will be tailored to the student's individual learning needs. At the minimum, students with no or minimal prior teaching experience will gain a beginning level of expertise in course planning, course evaluation, dealing with difficult student situations, test construction, paper assignment construction and grading, content delivery methods, as well as other aspects of the faculty teaching role. Students with more extensive teaching experience will tailor their residences with their residency supervisor to enhance their expertise in these various areas. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "TEACHING RESIDENCY: NURSING DOCTORAL TEACHING RESIDENCY: D'ANTONIO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23590/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "TEACHING RESIDENCY: NURSING DOCTORAL TEACHING RESIDENCY: D'ANTONIO", "sectionnum": "027", "primary_alias": "NURS-890-027", "path": "/courses/23590/sections/027", "id": "23590-027", "aliases": ["NURS-890-027"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 1, "path": "/courses/23590/sections/027/reviews/921-PATRICIA-O-BRIEN-D-ANTONIO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/921-PATRICIA-O-BRIEN-D-ANTONIO", "first_name": "PATRICIA O'BRIEN", "last_name": "D'ANTONIO", "id": "921-PATRICIA-O-BRIEN-D-ANTONIO", "name": "PATRICIA O'BRIEN D'ANTONIO"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "23590-027-921-PATRICIA-O-BRIEN-D-ANTONIO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "NURSING DOCTORAL TEACHING RESIDENCY: SOMMERS", "sectionnum": "035", "primary_alias": "NURS-890-035", "path": "/courses/23590/sections/035", "id": "23590-035", "aliases": ["NURS-890-035"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/23590/sections/035/reviews/3439-MARILYN-S--SOMMERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3439-MARILYN-S--SOMMERS", "first_name": "MARILYN S.", "last_name": "SOMMERS", "id": "3439-MARILYN-S--SOMMERS", "name": "MARILYN S.
