{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3579"}, "description": "This course focuses on the delivery of anesthesia care within advanced nursing practice in a broad range of clinical situations for patients with multiple, complex health problems. Through refinement of asssessment and management skills, critical thinking is further developed. Students progress by providing anesthesia care for special populations of patients with simple and complex health problems. The guidance of CRNA faculty preceptors contributes to the development of the student's critical thinking. Collaborative practice within a care team model is emphasized and with supervision, the student assumes more overall responsibility for the quality of care for the patients throughout the perioperative experience. \n\n", "semester": "2007B", "name": "CLINICAL FIELDWORK FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA PRACTICE III", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12736/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.31", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.85", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.85", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "CLINICAL FIELDWORK FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA PRACTICE III", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-793-900", "path": "/courses/12736/sections/900", "id": "12736-900", "aliases": ["NURS-793-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/12736/sections/900/reviews/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "MAGRO", "id": "3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "name": "MARIA MAGRO"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "12736-900-3128-MARIA-MAGRO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "3.42", "rWorkRequired": "2.91", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.08", "rCommAbility": "3.42", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "901", "primary_alias": "NURS-793-901", "path": "/courses/12736/sections/901", "id": "12736-901", "aliases": ["NURS-793-901"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/12736/sections/901/reviews/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "first_name": "MARIA", "last_name": "MAGRO", "id": "3128-MARIA-MAGRO", "name": "MARIA MAGRO"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "12736-901-3128-MARIA-MAGRO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-793", "path": "/courses/12736", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12736/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLINICAL FIELDWORK FOR NURSE ANESTHESIA PRACTICE III", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "NURS-793-900", "path": "/courses/12736/sections/900", "id": "12736-900", "aliases": ["NURS-793-900"]}, {"name": "CLINIC", "sectionnum": "901", "primary_alias": "NURS-793-901", "path": "/courses/12736/sections/901", "id": "12736-901", "aliases": ["NURS-793-901"]}]}, "id": 12736, "aliases": ["NURS-793"]}
