{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5578"}, "description": "This didactic course examines the epidemiologic, assessment, diagnostic, management and evaluation of acutely or critically ill adults across the adult-older adult age spectrum. Students explore the dynamic interplay between the pathophysiologic basis of disease and the psychosocial and socio-cultural responses to acute and critical illness and injury as they develop clinical decision-making skills. An evidence-based approach to nursing and medical management including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities is emphasized. Cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, infectious and prevention issues commonly encountered by adults are covered. Particular focus is placed on specific issues related to the older adult such as frailty, dehydration, loss of functional mobility, falls, and other geriatric syndromes. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29432/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.37", "rDifficulty": "2.74", "rTAQuality": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "3.65", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.49", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "3.62", "rInstructorQuality": "3.72"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-670-001", "path": "/courses/29432/sections/001", "id": "29432-001", "aliases": ["NURS-670-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/29432/sections/001/reviews/3455-CAROLINE-L-DOHERTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3455-CAROLINE-L-DOHERTY", "first_name": "CAROLINE L", "last_name": "DOHERTY", "id": "3455-CAROLINE-L-DOHERTY", "name": "CAROLINE L DOHERTY"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "29432-001-3455-CAROLINE-L-DOHERTY"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.37", "rDifficulty": "2.74", "rTAQuality": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "3.26", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.49", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.76", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-670-001", "path": "/courses/29432/sections/001", "id": "29432-001", "aliases": ["NURS-670-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/29432/sections/001/reviews/2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "first_name": "PATRICIA", "last_name": "PAWLOW", "id": "2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "name": "PATRICIA PAWLOW"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "29432-001-2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-670", "path": "/courses/29432", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29432/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-670-001", "path": "/courses/29432/sections/001", "id": "29432-001", "aliases": ["NURS-670-001"]}]}, "id": 29432, "aliases": ["NURS-670"]}
