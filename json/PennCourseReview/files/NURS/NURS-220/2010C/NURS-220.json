The student is provided with a theory base, as well as opportunities for providing care to children with acute and chronic health problems, and their families. This class emphasizes critical thinking, including the nursing process; develops strategies for optimizing health, maintaining individuality, promoting optimal developmental, physiological, and psychological functioning, and for enhancing strengths within the family unit. There are three primary foci for this course: taking care of sick children and families, child development, and professionalism.\r\n\r\nStudents generally felt that the \u201cmodules [were] really time consuming. One student noted that the validation process was \u201cvery subjective and frustrating.\u201d Some agreed that the \u201cknowledge and skills\u201d required of students was not clearly presented. Many felt that lab practice hours were helpful. Students generally wanted more emphasis on hands-on learning, as opposed to writing and responding to modules.\r\n\r\nOverall, students felt that there was not enough communication between different instructors and there was \u201cmuch variation\u201d between lab instructors. Many commented that the professor\u2019s instructions on Blackboard were very unclear. Most students did appreciate that the instructors made different lab times available for students who could not fit the original ones into their schedules. Students thought that passing or failing validation was \u201cbased on which validator\u201d they had.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the lack of organization, many students suggested that the lab seemed to teach material that was necessary for a \u201cpracticing nurse.\u201d Students generally agreed that the validations were clearly not the best testing process. Students reported that the modules were not graded.\r\n", "num_students": 87, "path": "/courses/23521/sections/201/reviews/4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "first_name": "ANGELA", "last_name": "IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "id": "4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK", "name": "ANGELA IORIANNI-CIMBAK"}, "num_reviewers": 81, "id": "23521-201-4484-ANGELA-IORIANNI-CIMBAK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-220", "path": "/courses/23521", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23521/sections", "values": [{"name": "NURSING OF CHILDREN: THEORY/CLINICAL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-001", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/001", "id": "23521-001", "aliases": ["NURS-220-001"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 4W CSH", "sectionnum": "101", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-101", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/101", "id": "23521-101", "aliases": ["NURS-220-101"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 5 South", "sectionnum": "102", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-102", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/102", "id": "23521-102", "aliases": ["NURS-220-102"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 5 West", "sectionnum": "103", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-103", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/103", "id": "23521-103", "aliases": ["NURS-220-103"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 4 South", "sectionnum": "104", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-104", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/104", "id": "23521-104", "aliases": ["NURS-220-104"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 6 East Cardiac", "sectionnum": "105", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-105", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/105", "id": "23521-105", "aliases": ["NURS-220-105"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 2 East NICU", "sectionnum": "106", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-106", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/106", "id": "23521-106", "aliases": ["NURS-220-106"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 2 East NICU", "sectionnum": "107", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-107", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/107", "id": "23521-107", "aliases": ["NURS-220-107"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 6 East Cardiac", "sectionnum": "108", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-108", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/108", "id": "23521-108", "aliases": ["NURS-220-108"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 4 South", "sectionnum": "109", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-109", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/109", "id": "23521-109", "aliases": ["NURS-220-109"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 4 East", "sectionnum": "110", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-110", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/110", "id": "23521-110", "aliases": ["NURS-220-110"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 4 South", "sectionnum": "111", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-111", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/111", "id": "23521-111", "aliases": ["NURS-220-111"]}, {"name": "CLINIC: CHOP - 5 South", "sectionnum": "112", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-112", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/112", "id": "23521-112", "aliases": ["NURS-220-112"]}, {"name": "LABORATORY", "sectionnum": "201", "primary_alias": "NURS-220-201", "path": "/courses/23521/sections/201", "id": "23521-201", "aliases": ["NURS-220-201"]}]}, "id": 23521, "aliases": ["NURS-220"]}
