Crimes to be studied include workplace violence, corporate crime, robbery, burglary, assault, rape, stalking, domestic violence, homicide, suicide, elderly abuse and child sexual abuse and exploitation.  The role of the medical examiner, health care providers and the FBI as they relate to victims of crime will be discussed. Emphasis will be given to exploring the elements of each crime and response patterns to victimizations.  Services available to victims of crime will be discussed.\r\nMost students were intrigued by the course material and learned a lot from it.  They found the content applicable and left the course feeling better informed of their roles as nurses in specific victimization situations.  A few non-nursing students also took this class and found it highly interesting and enjoyable.\r\nProfessor Brown did not do a lot of the teaching, but rather relied on guest speakers to communicate the content from different perspectives.  The TAs and Professor Brown had different grading standards, which frustrated a few students.\r\nShort essay assignments as well as a final paper or exam is required.  The assignments were not extensive or extremely difficult.\r\n", "num_students": 180, "path": "/courses/27896/sections/401/reviews/885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN", "first_name": "KATHLEEN M", "last_name": "BROWN", "id": "885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN", "name": "KATHLEEN M BROWN"}, "num_reviewers": 164, "id": "27896-401-885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rTAQuality": "2.59", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.08", "rCourseQuality": "3.02", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.01", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "3.16"}, "section": {"name": "RECITATION", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "NURS-533-402", "path": "/courses/27896/sections/402", "id": "27896-402", "aliases": ["NURS-533-402", "NURS-333-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 180, "path": "/courses/27896/sections/402/reviews/885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN", "first_name": "KATHLEEN M", "last_name": "BROWN", "id": "885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN", "name": "KATHLEEN M BROWN"}, "num_reviewers": 164, "id": "27896-402-885-KATHLEEN-M-BROWN"}]
