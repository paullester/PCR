{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/810"}, "description": "This final clinical nursing course focuses on the integration and synthesis of scientific knowledge with clinical nursing practice and the development of the professional nursing role. Building on content from prior courses, students will develop an understanding of management of patient care from the perspective of the individual client and family to groups of clients and eventually to management of health care systems. Principles of leadership, accountability and change will be integrated throughout. The process of transition from the student role to that of the professional nurse will be facilitated through discussion of organizational systems, professional issues, mechanisms for evaluation of care and the role of the nurse as patient advocate and change agent. \n\nStudents will select from several practice options for the clinical content of the course. Clinical seminar content will build on core content and will provide an exposure to advanced nursing concepts within the area of specialty practice. Application of conceptual models to clinical practice will be discussed and nursing research will be integrated throughout the course. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/810/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.98", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.02", "rInstructorAccess": "3.27", "rReadingsValue": "1.87", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.69", "rCommAbility": "3.16", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-370-001", "path": "/courses/810/sections/001", "id": "810-001", "aliases": ["NURS-370-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/810/sections/001/reviews/880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY", "first_name": "KATHLEEN", "last_name": "MCCAULEY", "id": "880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY", "name": "KATHLEEN MCCAULEY"}, "num_reviewers": 45, "id": "810-001-880-KATHLEEN-MCCAULEY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-370", "path": "/courses/810", "sections": {"path": "/courses/810/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED CLINICAL PRACTICE: THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-370-001", "path": "/courses/810/sections/001", "id": "810-001", "aliases": ["NURS-370-001"]}]}, "id": 810, "aliases": ["NURS-370"]}
