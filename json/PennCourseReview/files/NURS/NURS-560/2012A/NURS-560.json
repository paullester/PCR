While some students felt \u201cgood information\u201d was covered over the duration of the course, the majority believed the material was not presented in a manner that facilitated learning. In particular, the material was geared towards pharmacists rather than nurses. Students described the course as \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cdisorganized\u201d and felt that they were \u201cpoorly prepared\u201d to write prescriptions in outpatient setting following completion of the course. The general consensus was that the material was not relevant to an outpatient or primary care setting. \r\n\tThe course was split between a main professor and a variety of guest lecturers.   Students tended to appreciate many of the guest lecturers, describing them as having done a \u201cwonderful job.\u201d However, in many cases guest lecturers assumed students knew less or had less experience and thus lectured on known material. Furthermore, many speakers were critical care pharmacists and thus their knowledge base was not adequately applicable to the enrolled primary care pediatric students. Students were frustrated with how the course professor, Dr. Puzanian, taught the material and organized the course.  Overall students considered the faculty commitment to this course as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\r\n\tThe workload of this course is minimal, as the course\u2019s grades stem only from graded exams. Students also commented that many classes were excused early, there were few assigned readings, and no assigned textbook. However, the tests themselves were viewed as difficult because the test questions were inconsistent with material covered in class. To enroll in this course, students must fulfill the prerequisite of NURS 684. \r\n", "num_students": 46, "path": "/courses/27902/sections/001/reviews/5239-HOURY-W-PUZANIAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5239-HOURY-W-PUZANIAN", "first_name": "HOURY W", "last_name": "PUZANIAN", "id": "5239-HOURY-W-PUZANIAN", "name": "HOURY W PUZANIAN"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "27902-001-5239-HOURY-W-PUZANIAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-560", "path": "/courses/27902", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27902/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED PEDIATRIC PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS IN NURSING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-560-001", "path": "/courses/27902/sections/001", "id": "27902-001", "aliases": ["NURS-560-001"]}]}, "id": 27902, "aliases": ["NURS-560"]}
