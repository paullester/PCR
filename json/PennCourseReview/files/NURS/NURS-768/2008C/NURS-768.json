Students will examine and discuss the key characteristics of the CNS role. The dynamic interplay of the characteristic role components will be explored and will include discussion of how these components interact with each other and the complex systems in which CNS practice takes place. The role of the CNS in optimizing patient outcomes will be examined. Strategies to enhance professional practice, both by the CNS and by professional colleagues will be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST THEORY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19111/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-768-001", "path": "/courses/19111/sections/001", "id": "19111-001", "aliases": ["NURS-768-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/19111/sections/001/reviews/2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "first_name": "PATRICIA", "last_name": "PAWLOW", "id": "2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "name": "PATRICIA PAWLOW"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "19111-001-2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-768", "path": "/courses/19111", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19111/sections", "values": [{"name": "CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST THEORY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-768-001", "path": "/courses/19111/sections/001", "id": "19111-001", "aliases": ["NURS-768-001"]}]}, "id": 19111, "aliases": ["NURS-768"]}
