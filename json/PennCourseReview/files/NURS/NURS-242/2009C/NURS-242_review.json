The biochemical and physiological effects of drugs are related to their therapeutic and toxicologic effects.\r\n\r\nOverall, students found this class to be \u201cvery useful\u201d and applicable to nursing practice. Most students felt there was a lot of information to be covered in only one semester. The content matched the students\u2019 current experience and knowledge level.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boullatta received a variety of praises for his teaching style and accessibility. Many students agreed that Professor Boullatta was \u201cvery good\u201d, \u201cexcellent\u201d, and able to \u201cstimulate students\u2019 interests.\u201d Some even commented on Professor Boullatta\u2019s humor and how it made a Friday morning class more enjoyable overall.\r\n\r\nStudents felt the quizzes were extremely helpful to keep the drugs fresh in their minds. Some stated that the textbook was not useful. The powerpoint slides were systematically laid out and understandable. The exams were \u201cvery fair.\u201d A general comment was that the class should be held twice a week instead of the once weekly, 3-hour class. This course is a requirement for junior nursing students. The prerequisites include N40 (41 or 42), N131, and N132. The focus on nursing application makes this class not very appropriate for non-nursing students.", "num_students": 144, "path": "/courses/17798/sections/001/reviews/3123-JOSEPH-I--BOULLATA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3123-JOSEPH-I--BOULLATA", "first_name": "JOSEPH I.", "last_name": "BOULLATA", "id": "3123-JOSEPH-I--BOULLATA", "name": "JOSEPH I.
