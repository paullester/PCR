{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5707"}, "description": "In this didactic course, students learn to integrate their advanced pharmacology and pathophysiology background with their understanding of acute illness and injury. The focus is on the evidence-based management of patients with neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, oncologic, and metabolic health problems. Students develop skills to create a differential diagnosis when an adult/older-adult presents with a constellation of symptoms. Common and atypical presentations of illness and disease are explored. Focus is placed on holistic care including the psychosocial, cultural, and spiritual aspects of patients' response to their illness or injury. Epidemiology, assessment, diagnosis, management, and advanced clinical decision making based on current clinical research are emphasized. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30778/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.35", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rTAQuality": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "3.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.26", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "3.26", "rInstructorQuality": "3.43"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-671-001", "path": "/courses/30778/sections/001", "id": "30778-001", "aliases": ["NURS-671-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/30778/sections/001/reviews/2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "first_name": "PATRICIA", "last_name": "PAWLOW", "id": "2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW", "name": "PATRICIA PAWLOW"}, "num_reviewers": 50, "id": "30778-001-2637-PATRICIA-PAWLOW"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.35", "rDifficulty": "2.71", "rTAQuality": "2.19", "rStimulateInterest": "3.08", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.26", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "2.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "3.08", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-671-001", "path": "/courses/30778/sections/001", "id": "30778-001", "aliases": ["NURS-671-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/30778/sections/001/reviews/4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART", "first_name": "HEIDI B", "last_name": "ELGART", "id": "4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART", "name": "HEIDI B ELGART"}, "num_reviewers": 50, "id": "30778-001-4695-HEIDI-B-ELGART"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-671", "path": "/courses/30778", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30778/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRINCIPLES OF ADULT GERONTOLOGY ACUTE CARE II", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-671-001", "path": "/courses/30778/sections/001", "id": "30778-001", "aliases": ["NURS-671-001"]}]}, "id": 30778, "aliases": ["NURS-671"]}
