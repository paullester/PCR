It provides a foundation for\r\nstudents or practicing clinicians who are interested in quality improvement and patient\r\nsafety research, administration, or clinical applications. Content addresses the history of\r\nthe quality improvement process in healthcare, quality databases and improvement\r\nprocess tools and programs. Through the use of case studies and exercises students\r\nbecome familiar with the use of several quality improvement programs and tools. For\r\nexample, the Plan-Do-Study- Act (PDSA) cycle, Six Sigma and the Toyota Production\r\nSystem known as Lean Production processes are addressed. Students can use this course\r\nto identify the tools and design the methods that they plan to employ in a quality\r\nimprovement or patient safety project in their area of interest.\r\nOverall, students felt that this course was \u201ca good introduction\u201d and \u201cvery\r\ninteresting\u201d and \u201cinteractive.\u201d Furthermore, several students praised the course for being\r\n\u201cvery practical,\u201d while others felt it could have \u201ca bit more emphasis on theory.\u201d Other\r\nstudents praised the variety of students and perspectives presented in the course.\r\nStudents praised Burke\u2019s lectures, but they felt there was \u201ctoo much busy work\u201d\r\nand that the \u201cproject was very time-consuming.\u201d\r\nOverall, students \u201cwould recommend this course to others in the healthcare,\u201d but\r\nsome \u201cdid not feel that the material was at the level of a Master's course at Penn.\u201d Also,\r\nother students felt that the information was unevenly distributed claiming that, \u201csome of\r\nthe curriculum overlapped too much and other important areas were only surveyed.\u201d", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/24887/sections/401/reviews/2288-KATHLEEN-G--BURKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2288-KATHLEEN-G--BURKE", "first_name": "KATHLEEN G.", "last_name": "BURKE", "id": "2288-KATHLEEN-G--BURKE", "name": "KATHLEEN G.

The context for this course is the\r\napplication of cell biology to understanding the cellular basis of human diseases and the\r\nrole of genetics and genomics in health and disease processes.\r\nThe course provides \"a very good foundation\" to quality improvement in\r\nhealthcare. Students found the material diverse, interesting, and organized. Moreover,\r\nstudents remarked that the course would have practical and professional applications for\r\nthem.\r\nThe course is co-taught by Professors Myers and Burke. Students liked having\r\nprojects instead of tests, but felt that professor-student communication could have been\r\nbetter. Students benefited from the diverse perspectives offered by guest speakers.\r\nStudents did not find the course too difficult, but several remarked on the amount\r\nof \"busywork\" and rushed project completion timeframe.
