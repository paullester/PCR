{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5688"}, "description": "This mini course is restricted to recipients of the Mack Fellowship for Technological Innovation which is offered each year to four students or teams via an open competition announced to all second-year MBA students in January, with winners selected in May. The mini-course is a required part of the broader Fellowship to ensure grounding in current concepts, frameworks and tools for managing emerging technologies. The course covers such topics as how to assess innovation opportunities, common traps firms fall into, winning strategies and business models, financing new ventures, organizational structure and alliances, as well as leadership. \n\nCourse requirements: In addition to participating in four scheduled class sessions, each student/team needs to submit a 10 page methodology paper by October 15 in order to complete just the mini-course. This entails justifying the selection of 5 to 8 concepts or tools relevant to the student's research project, followed by a further narrowing down to 2 to 4 concepts to be used in this particular research project. The main purpose of this paper, apart from completing the mini-course, is to guide the student or team as they develop their larger research report which is due by year end. This final research report is not part of this course but required to complete the Fellowship. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ADV STUDY-ORGAN EFFECT: Decision Making in the Leadership Chair", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30647/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rTAQuality": "3.29", "rStimulateInterest": "2.39", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.28", "rInstructorAccess": "1.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "ADV STUDY-ORGAN EFFECT: Decision Making in the Leadership Chair", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-892-001", "path": "/courses/30647/sections/001", "id": "30647-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-892-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/30647/sections/001/reviews/6526-WILLIAM-P-LAUDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6526-WILLIAM-P-LAUDER", "first_name": "WILLIAM P", "last_name": "LAUDER", "id": "6526-WILLIAM-P-LAUDER", "name": "WILLIAM P LAUDER"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "30647-001-6526-WILLIAM-P-LAUDER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-892", "path": "/courses/30647", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30647/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV STUDY-ORGAN EFFECT: Decision Making in the Leadership Chair", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-892-001", "path": "/courses/30647/sections/001", "id": "30647-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-892-001"]}]}, "id": 30647, "aliases": ["MGMT-892"]}
