{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1995"}, "description": "This course encourages students to analyze the problems of managing the total enterprise in the domestic and international setting. The focus is on the competitive strategy of the firm, examining issues central to its long- and short-term competitive position. Students act in the roles of key decision-makers or their advisors and solve problems related to the development or maintenance of the competitive advantage of the firm in a given market. The first module of the course develops an understanding of key strategic frameworks using theoretical readings and case-based discussions. Students will learn concepts and tools for analyzing the competitive environment, strategic position and firm-specific capabilities in order to understand the sources of a firm's competitive advantage. In addition, students will address corporate strategy issues such as the economic logic and administrative challenges associated with diversification choices about horizontal and vertical integration. The second module will be conducted as a multi-session, computer-based simulation in which students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts and tools from module 1 to make strategic decisions. \n\nThe goal of the course is for students to develop an analytical tool kit for understanding strategic issues and to enrich their appreciation for the thoughtprocesses essential to incisive strategic analysis. This course offers students the opportunity to develop a general management perspective by combining their knowledge of specific functional areas with an appreciation forthe requirements posed by the need to integrate all functions into a coherent whole. Students will develop skills in structuring and solving complex business problems. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "BUSINESS POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23405/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.34", "rStimulateInterest": "3.05", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "2.98", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.51", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "BUSINESS POLICY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-223-001", "path": "/courses/23405/sections/001", "id": "23405-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-223-001"]}, "comments": "Management 223 encourages students to analyze the problems of managing the total enterprise in the domestic and international setting.

However, there were mixed reviews about the computer-based simulation. A number described it as \u201cdifficult but very good and informative\u201d while others thought it \u201cwas too time consuming\u201d and said that they \u201cwould have rather focused on the real world.\u201d One student wished that the class could have \u201cgone deeper into the subject matter,\u201d and another student would have preferred a more \u201cstructured approach.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents\u2019 praise of Professor Chatain was universal and enthusiastic. He was described as \u201cvery articulate,\u201d \u201cvery accessible,\u201d \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d \u201cwise,\u201d and \u201cvery engaging.\u201d One student described Professor Chatain as teaching \u201cmanagement from a deep intellectual perspective, challenging [students] to think in new ways,\u201d and another said that he \u201cdid a great job communicating the subject matter and being available to help students.\u201d A third student praised his appreciation for \u201cinnovative and out of the box thinking, rather than just fluff\u201d and his ability to lead \u201can interesting discussion\u201d and to \u201cextract value from [students\u2019] comments.\u201d Unfortunately, Professor Chatain did not hold regular office hours and instead was only available by appointment.\r\n\r\nOne student observed that there was \u201cquite a bit of reading required and cold calling in class\u201d and a number of students mentioned a participation grade, which one student complained made \u201cdiscussions too formal and intimidating to really enjoy simply for the love of learning.\u201d One student summarized by saying that \u201cthe overall design of the course is good with evenly distributed coursework (as in the grades don\u2019t all come at the end).\u201d The prerequisites for the course are Management 100 and Management 101, and it is intended for juniors and seniors who have completed introductory courses in finance, marketing, and accounting. Management 223 is one of five core courses for the Management Concentration from which students concentrating in Management must select at least two. It can also fulfill a requirement for the Managing Electronic Commerce Concentration.\r\n\r\n", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/23405/sections/001/reviews/4884-OLIVIER-CHATAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4884-OLIVIER-CHATAIN", "first_name": "OLIVIER", "last_name": "CHATAIN", "id": "4884-OLIVIER-CHATAIN", "name": "OLIVIER CHATAIN"}, "num_reviewers": 45, "id": "23405-001-4884-OLIVIER-CHATAIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-223", "path": "/courses/23405", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23405/sections", "values": [{"name": "BUSINESS POLICY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-223-001", "path": "/courses/23405/sections/001", "id": "23405-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-223-001"]}]}, "id": 23405, "aliases": ["MGMT-223"]}
