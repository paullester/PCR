{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4488"}, "description": "Successful practitioners of corporate diplomacy meld art and skill in engaging external stakeholders to advance their corporate interests. They craft international coalitions of stakeholders spanning politicians, regulators, bureaucrats, analysts, investors, lawyers, reporters, consumers and activists. They influence these stakeholders' opinions, perceptions, behaviors and decisions so as to secure a favorable policy outcome, collective decision or shift in group opinion that enhances their corporation's ability to generate a profit by satisfying a market demand. This course surveys the managerial, political economic, sociological and psychological foundations of corporate diplomacy as well as case study examples of successful and failed implementation in order to develop an interdisciplinary framework for the play of global influence games. The insights gained can be applied to influence team decision-making and organizational politics as well as by individuals and organizations in lobbying, marketing, sales, political campaigns and corporate,national or multilateral projections of soft power. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "POL ENVIRON OF MULT FIRM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16747/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.12", "rDifficulty": "2.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.72", "rInstructorAccess": "3.04", "rReadingsValue": "3.24", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.20", "rCommAbility": "3.68", "rInstructorQuality": "3.52"}, "section": {"name": "POL ENVIRON OF MULT FIRM", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MGMT-715-701", "path": "/courses/16747/sections/701", "id": "16747-701", "aliases": ["MGMT-715-701"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/16747/sections/701/reviews/795-WITOLD-HENISZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/795-WITOLD-HENISZ", "first_name": "WITOLD", "last_name": "HENISZ", "id": "795-WITOLD-HENISZ", "name": "WITOLD HENISZ"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "16747-701-795-WITOLD-HENISZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-715", "path": "/courses/16747", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16747/sections", "values": [{"name": "POL ENVIRON OF MULT FIRM", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MGMT-715-701", "path": "/courses/16747/sections/701", "id": "16747-701", "aliases": ["MGMT-715-701"]}]}, "id": 16747, "aliases": ["MGMT-715"]}
