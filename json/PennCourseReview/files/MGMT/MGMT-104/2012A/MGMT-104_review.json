The specific constraints discussed are labor markets (external and internal), labor laws (governing employment policies and employee relations), and labor unions (and the threat thereof). Particular attention is paid to the relationship of these constraints to the competitiveness of American enterprise in the global economy. \r\nStudents expressed interest in the topics that were covered in the course. These topics are \u201cvaluable to people in the human resources field,\u201d but they are also \u201cintuitive.\u201d One student felt that there was already a general understanding of \u201cthe key concepts.\u201d\r\nProfessor Fang received mixed reviews. Students appreciated that Professor Fang was communicative, \u201caccommodating,\u201d and \u201cpassionate.\u201d However, students would have appreciated greater structure and more explicit guidelines in the beginning of the course.
