{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5341"}, "description": "This full semester elective is designed for students in the MBA program as well as other professional schools (e.g., Law, Communications, Public Policy and Engineering) with an interest in the interface between multinational corporations and political and social actors. The course is consciously interdisciplinary in its design and is focused on a central phenomenon: internationalinvestors' attempts to overcome political and social challenges that stand between market demand and shareholder profit. \n\nThe course is built around the assumption that as international investment involves individual working in teams in multiple organizations from various countries motivated by some combination of self-interest, profit and public interest, an interdisciplinary perspective in which one genuinely integrates insights and tools from economics, political science, international business and strategy will outperform a narrower approach. While our main focus will be oncorporate diplomacy in a global business environment, the topics we will examine are generalizable to many additional contexts including team decision-making, organizational politics, lobbying, marketing, sales, political campaigns and corporate, national or multilateral projections of soft power. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "CORPORATE DIPLOMACY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29286/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.24", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.53", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.72", "rCommAbility": "3.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "CORPORATE DIPLOMACY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-720-001", "path": "/courses/29286/sections/001", "id": "29286-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-720-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/29286/sections/001/reviews/6331-SANJAY-PATNAIK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6331-SANJAY-PATNAIK", "first_name": "SANJAY", "last_name": "PATNAIK", "id": "6331-SANJAY-PATNAIK", "name": "SANJAY PATNAIK"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "29286-001-6331-SANJAY-PATNAIK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-720", "path": "/courses/29286", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29286/sections", "values": [{"name": "CORPORATE DIPLOMACY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-720-001", "path": "/courses/29286/sections/001", "id": "29286-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-720-001"]}]}, "id": 29286, "aliases": ["MGMT-720"]}
