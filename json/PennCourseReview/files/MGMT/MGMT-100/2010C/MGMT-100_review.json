Many students felt that they \u201cgained a great deal of real world experience\u201d and learned a lot about themselves and \u201chow to work in teams.\u201d A number commented that they \u201cenjoyed working with [their] group[s]\u201d and that \u201cthe team interaction was the most useful portion\u201d of the course. A couple described the readings as \u201crelevant and interesting.\u201d On the other hand, a large contingent of students felt that the course \u201cinvolved a lot of fluffy subject matter,\u201d \u201csuffered from a general lack of substance and concrete intellectual structure,\u201d and was \u201cfull of busy work.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents had mostly positive opinions of Professor Maxwell, describing him as \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cvery professional,\u201d and \u201chighly competent.\u201d One student said \u201che genuinely cared and showed interest in MGMT\u201d and another said that he made \u201cthe course fun and also educational.\u201d However, students found his interaction with students to be weak. One said that \u201che was very distanced from students\u201d and another described him as \u201ca little dry. \u201d A couple of students praised the team advisors.\r\n\r\nStudents agreed that the class was \u201ca lot of work\u201d and took \u201cup a lot of time, between the extra hours put in for the project and the presentations.\u201d Many students also objected to the grading system, which they described as \u201ctoo subjective\u201d and which a few students said created a \u201ccutthroat atmosphere.\u201d Additionally, several students felt that \u201cthe people who deserved A's [wouldn\u2019t] necessarily get them.\u201d Others complained, \u201cthe lack of transparency in grading left students without any idea how or whether they should change their approaches until the very end of the semester.\u201d All first-year Wharton students are required to take Management 100. Freshmen generally take Management 100 during their first semester while transfer and dual-degree students typically take it in the spring of their first year at Wharton.\r\n", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/23399/sections/008/reviews/211-CHRISTOPHER-I--MAXWELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/211-CHRISTOPHER-I--MAXWELL", "first_name": "CHRISTOPHER I.", "last_name": "MAXWELL", "id": "211-CHRISTOPHER-I--MAXWELL", "name": "CHRISTOPHER I.

The course involves study of literature on leadership, management communication, and group dynamics and also includes a field project. The field project provides the context in which the student develops as a leader, practices communication skills, learns about the nature of group work, and enhances his or her sensitivity to community issues.\r\n\r\nOverall, students enjoyed the course.
