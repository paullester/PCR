{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4326"}, "description": "This course examines how the kind of firms in which most Wharton students will spend the next stage of their careers came to be as they are today. At a superficial level, the course's objectives are descriptive and narrative. Its deeper purpose is to give students some idea of how to think about the future evolution of firms and industries. The course will discuss the historical development of the business enterprise as an institution. It will also cover the evolution of competition and strategy and of corporate finance. The focus will be on American developments, since many of the innovations took place here; but there is scope for comparison with institutions in Japan and the leading European economies if there is student interest. The course considers issues arising in a number of different management disciplines and shows off their interrelationships. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "AMER. BUS.
