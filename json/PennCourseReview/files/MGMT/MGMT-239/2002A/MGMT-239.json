{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/750"}, "description": "We are born in and spend much of our lives in organizations. From families to schools to athletic teams and jobs, organizations play a central role in our experience. And this is especially so as we pursue careers.

At other times we hate them being unfeeling and inflexible bureaucracies. In this coures we shall examine how organizations are structured with a particular emphasis on businesses and not-for-profit organizations for which most of us will work.
