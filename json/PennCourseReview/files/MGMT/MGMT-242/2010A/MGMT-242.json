{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4320"}, "description": "The objective of this course is to provide a general framework for describing and analysing organizational problems in relation to corporate governance, executive compensation and the board of directors. The course begins from the observation that in practice self-interested managers are often in a position to take actions that are not necessarily in the interests of the owners of firms. Accordingly managers may not undertake desirable value or wealth maximizing strategies. The course examines the governance of firms including the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. It examines how the corporate governance, compensation and incentive systems can mitigate agency problems that are inherent in organizations. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "CORP.
