We will examine the identity, background, incentives and operations of relevant national and international political actors; and the process by which they generates policies that can adversely or favorably influence firm profitability. Corporations whose success depends crucially on a sophisticated analysis of the contending forces in the geopolitical arena and an ability to influence policy outcomes will serve as examples of the first-order strategic importance of incorporating the political environment in multinational strategy formulation. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "POLITICS OF MULT FIRM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/742/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.58", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.48", "rCourseQuality": "3.15", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.85", "rCommAbility": "3.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "POLITICS OF MULT FIRM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-209-001", "path": "/courses/742/sections/001", "id": "742-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-209-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/742/sections/001/reviews/795-WITOLD-HENISZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/795-WITOLD-HENISZ", "first_name": "WITOLD", "last_name": "HENISZ", "id": "795-WITOLD-HENISZ", "name": "WITOLD HENISZ"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "742-001-795-WITOLD-HENISZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-209", "path": "/courses/742", "sections": {"path": "/courses/742/sections", "values": [{"name": "POLITICS OF MULT FIRM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-209-001", "path": "/courses/742/sections/001", "id": "742-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-209-001"]}]}, "id": 742, "aliases": ["MGMT-209"]}
