{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/742"}, "description": "This course is designed for undergraduate students with an interest in the interface between multinational corporations and political and social actors. The course will explore the intersection of international strategy and internationalrelations to help students identify and introduce sustainable and profitable business strategies in sectors with a history of strong potential for ongoing political intervention. We will examine the background, incentives and operations of relevant national and international political actors and the process by which they generate policies that can adversely or favorably influence firm profitability. Corporations, whose success depends crucially on a sophisticated analysis of their broader business environment and on their ability to influence policy outcomes, will serve as examples of the strategic importance of incorporating the political environment into multinational strategy formulation. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "POL & SOC ENVIRON OF MM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27747/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.04", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.39", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.96", "rCommAbility": "3.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "POL & SOC ENVIRON OF MM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-209-001", "path": "/courses/27747/sections/001", "id": "27747-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-209-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/27747/sections/001/reviews/5417-SINZIANA-DOROBANTU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5417-SINZIANA-DOROBANTU", "first_name": "SINZIANA", "last_name": "DOROBANTU", "id": "5417-SINZIANA-DOROBANTU", "name": "SINZIANA DOROBANTU"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "27747-001-5417-SINZIANA-DOROBANTU"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-209", "path": "/courses/27747", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27747/sections", "values": [{"name": "POL & SOC ENVIRON OF MM", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-209-001", "path": "/courses/27747/sections/001", "id": "27747-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-209-001"]}]}, "id": 27747, "aliases": ["MGMT-209"]}
