{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/747"}, "description": "This course focuses on the comparative institutional environments in which business, government, and society interact. It provides students with a set of conceptual tools and analytical frameworks to navigate the complexities and ambiguities of the global economy. It provides an understanding of how to identify, measure and interpret the economic, social, political and cultural factors that shape regulatory policy, business strategy and market outcomes. It does so by traversing a rich empirical terrain that cuts across developing and industrialized countries, and is especially attentive to change over time. The course is deeply inter-disciplinary and brings insights from economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, geography and history. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "INT'L COMPARATIVE MGMT.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30623/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.19", "rDifficulty": "2.06", "rTAQuality": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.12", "rWorkRequired": "2.56", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.69", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "INT'L COMPARATIVE MGMT.", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-234-001", "path": "/courses/30623/sections/001", "id": "30623-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-234-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/30623/sections/001/reviews/6522-JASON-B-JACKSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6522-JASON-B-JACKSON", "first_name": "JASON B", "last_name": "JACKSON", "id": "6522-JASON-B-JACKSON", "name": "JASON B JACKSON"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "30623-001-6522-JASON-B-JACKSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-234", "path": "/courses/30623", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30623/sections", "values": [{"name": "INT'L COMPARATIVE MGMT.", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-234-001", "path": "/courses/30623/sections/001", "id": "30623-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-234-001"]}]}, "id": 30623, "aliases": ["MGMT-234"]}
