{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1998"}, "description": "This course is directed toward the attainment of three interdependent objectives: 1)to develop an understanding of strategy implementation in complex organizations, 2) to understand how organizational planning, design, control and human resource decisions are interdependent and critical to successful implementation, and 3) to develop a sensitivity to the \"realities\" of strategy implementation in \"real-world\" organizations. Consideration of theories of implemenation is not sufficient; it is necessary also to see strategy implementation as a process of that change that, to be successful, must take a number of factors into consideration. These include how decisions affect individuals in organizations and their consequent commitment to implementation efforts. To meet these objectives, emphasis will be on lectures, class discussions, and case studies as the instructional techniques. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18982/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.04", "rDifficulty": "2.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.93", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.08", "rReadingsValue": "2.79", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.79", "rCommAbility": "3.36", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-282-001", "path": "/courses/18982/sections/001", "id": "18982-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-282-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 31, "path": "/courses/18982/sections/001/reviews/3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "first_name": "LAWTON R", "last_name": "BURNS", "id": "3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "name": "LAWTON R BURNS"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "18982-001-3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-282", "path": "/courses/18982", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18982/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-282-001", "path": "/courses/18982/sections/001", "id": "18982-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-282-001"]}]}, "id": 18982, "aliases": ["MGMT-282"]}
