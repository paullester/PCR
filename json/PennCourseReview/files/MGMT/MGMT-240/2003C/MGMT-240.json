This will be a highly interactive course with emphasis on class participation and experiential learning. One of the goals of this course is to provide both the conceptual understanding and the behavioral skills required to implement strategies. To this end, class sessions will make use of a variety of approaches to teaching and learning, including the case method, simulation exercises and lectures. We will cover topics such as leading groups, group formation and socialization, diversity, creativity, group problem solving and decision making, conflict and knowledge sharing. Students will leave this class with knowledge of how to most effectively lead a team as well as how to be an effective team member. [NOTE: Instructors may have different objectives for this course.
