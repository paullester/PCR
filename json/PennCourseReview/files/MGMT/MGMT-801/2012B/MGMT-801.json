{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4332"}, "description": "This is the foundation course in the Entrepreneurial Management program. The purpose of this course is to explore the many dimensions of new venture creation and growth. While most of the examples in class will be drawn from new venture formation, the principles also apply to entrepreneurship in corporate settings and to non-profit entrepreneurship. We will be concerned with content and process questions as well as with formulation and implementation issues that relate to conceptualizing, developing and managing successful new ventures. The emphasis in this course is on applying and synthesizing concepts and techniques from functional areas of strategic management, finance, accounting, managerial economics, marketing, operations management, and organizational behavior in the context of new venture development. The class serves as both a stand alone class and as a preparatory course to those interested in writing and implementing a business plan (the subject of the semester-long course, MGMT 806). \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28401/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.53", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "2.61", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "2.58", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.61", "rCommAbility": "2.81", "rInstructorQuality": "2.79"}, "section": {"name": "ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MGMT-801-701", "path": "/courses/28401/sections/701", "id": "28401-701", "aliases": ["MGMT-801-701"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/28401/sections/701/reviews/4432-DAVID-H--HSU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4432-DAVID-H--HSU", "first_name": "DAVID H.", "last_name": "HSU", "id": "4432-DAVID-H--HSU", "name": "DAVID H.
