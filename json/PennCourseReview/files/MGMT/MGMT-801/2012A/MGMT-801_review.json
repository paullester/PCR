The emphasis in this course is on applying and synthesizing concepts and techniques from the functional areas of accounting, finance, managerial economics, marketing, operations management, and organization behavior in the context of new venture development. The class sessions are designed to familiarize you with the many dimensions of entrepreneurship and new venture development. While most of the examples in class will be drawn from new venture formation, the principles also apply to entrepreneurship in corporate settings and to non-profit entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nOverall, students had negative reviews of the class. Many found that the class went \u201ctoo fast\u201d and \u201ccovered too much material without going in depth for any topic.\u201d One student commented that the class \u201ctries to do too much for a 0.5 credit class.\u201d There is a business plan component in the class, and coupled with case studies, many felt like it was an overwhelming amount of work especially since the case studies were extremely long without a definitive point.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hsu generally had positive reviews. Students appreciated his ability to create \u201cengaging classroom discussions,\u201d but many felt that he should try to create more direction in these discussions. \r\n\r\nStudents were not decided on whether majors should take the class. The course is \u201cextremely time consuming,\u201d but also a \u201cgood introduction to entrepreneurship.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/27772/sections/002/reviews/4432-DAVID-H--HSU", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4432-DAVID-H--HSU", "first_name": "DAVID H.", "last_name": "HSU", "id": "4432-DAVID-H--HSU", "name": "DAVID H.
