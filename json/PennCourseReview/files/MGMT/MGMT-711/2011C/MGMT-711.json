{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4608"}, "description": "This is a course in analyzing competitive interactions. The course emphasizes a vision of strategy in which each competitor simultaneously chooses its strategy, taking into account the strategies of its opponents. Crucial to this vision is the anticipation of the moves of your opponent and, in particular, the expectation that your opponent is (almost) as smart as you are. Equal attention will be given to the development of techniques for analyzing competitive interactions and to the application of those techniques. Game theory and the economics of industrial organization provide the basis for the theoretical constructs developed in the course. Topics that will be explored include: market failures and profitability, competitive bidding, signaling, entry deterrence, agenda setting, regulations, and price wars. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "COMP STR/IND STR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24755/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "1.88", "rStimulateInterest": "2.06", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.26", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.31", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "2.44", "rInstructorQuality": "2.32"}, "section": {"name": "COMP STR/IND STR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-711-001", "path": "/courses/24755/sections/001", "id": "24755-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-711-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/24755/sections/001/reviews/1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "first_name": "LOUIS A", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS", "name": "LOUIS A THOMAS"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "24755-001-1977-LOUIS-A-THOMAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-711", "path": "/courses/24755", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24755/sections", "values": [{"name": "COMP STR/IND STR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-711-001", "path": "/courses/24755/sections/001", "id": "24755-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-711-001"]}]}, "id": 24755, "aliases": ["MGMT-711"]}
