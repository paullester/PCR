{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4337"}, "description": "The basic thesis of this elective course is that many social problems, if attacked entrepreneurially, create opportunities for launching businesses that simultaneously generate profits and alleviate the social problem. This approach generates societal wealth as well as entrepreneurial wealth. The course is distinguished from public sector initiatives to address social problems, and also from \"social entrepreneurship\" programs where social wealth creation is a by-product rather than the target of the entrepreneurial effort. Student teams are expected to develop a plan to launch a societal wealth generating business. The preference is for them to begin the course with already conceived ideas for entrepreneurial solutions to social problems. They may also join a team to work on a project proposed by a student who already has a business idea. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SOCIETAL WEALTH VENTURING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27777/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.47", "rDifficulty": "2.18", "rStimulateInterest": "1.82", "rRecommendMajor": "2.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.12", "rReadingsValue": "2.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.76", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.09"}, "section": {"name": "SOCIETAL WEALTH VENTURING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MGMT-810-401", "path": "/courses/27777/sections/401", "id": "27777-401", "aliases": ["MGMT-810-401", "MGMT-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/27777/sections/401/reviews/4435-IAN-C-MACMILLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4435-IAN-C-MACMILLAN", "first_name": "IAN C", "last_name": "MACMILLAN", "id": "4435-IAN-C-MACMILLAN", "name": "IAN C MACMILLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "27777-401-4435-IAN-C-MACMILLAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-810", "path": "/courses/27777", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27777/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOCIETAL WEALTH VENTURING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MGMT-810-401", "path": "/courses/27777/sections/401", "id": "27777-401", "aliases": ["MGMT-810-401", "MGMT-212-401"]}]}, "id": 27777, "aliases": ["MGMT-810", "MGMT-212"]}
