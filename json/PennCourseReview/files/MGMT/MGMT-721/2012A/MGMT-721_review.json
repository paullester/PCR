The objectives are three-fold: (1) to arm students with a set of tools to facilitate the selection of the appropriate growth strategy in a given situation; (2) to provide students with insights as to how to manage partnerships like alliances, outsourcing, and corporate venturing; and, (3) to develop a comprehensive framework for executing M&As, from initiation to implementation. The emphasis is on strategic and operational aspects of these transactions, rather than financial considerations. The course begins by examining the different modes of corporate development, including the applicability and management approaches for each, particularly various types of partnerships. It then delves into acquisition screening and deal-making. Afterwards, it considers in detail post-merger integration. The course ends with the presentation of project work and a review of the course learnings. In terms of its pedagogical approach, this is designed to be an interactive, applied, case-based course with accompanying conceptual readings to help structure students\u2019 thinking. Given the nature of the course, students also apply the lessons from the cases to understand the challenges and implications of relevant recent and on-going deals. In addition, guest speakers with experience in investment banking, consulting, and industry are invited to share their perspectives. A semester-long group project is intended to give students the opportunity to apply their learning from the course to a context that is most interesting and relevant to them.\r\nStudents universally felt that MGMT 721 was \u201cvery enjoyable\u201d and \u201cone of the best classes\u2026at Wharton.\u201d  Several described the class as \u201cwell-structured,\u201d and while there was a lot of reading, a few noted that the requirement to submit a write-up before class was \u201cwell worth the higher quality discussion that resulted.\u201d Overall, students felt that the class provided a \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d \u201cnot finance oriented\u201d overview of M&A and gave them practical knowledge that they could apply in the real world.  While a couple students suggested adding more variety to the cases studied, this was a minor complaint among the enthusiastic praise for the course as a whole.   \r\nAccording to Professor Chaudhuri\u2019s students, \u201cWharton needs more professors like [him]\u201d.  Many described Professor Chaudhuri as \u201cextremely knowledgeable,\u201d \u201cvery engaged,\u201d and \u201ca good facilitator\u201d of class discussions. Professor Chaudhuri \u201c[came] to each class with a highly-developed roadmap for each case.\u201d  Several further appreciated that Professor Chaudhuri \u201c[held them] accountable for knowing the material\u201d and \u201c[did] a good job getting students interested.\u201d\r\nSeveral students noted that the workload was heavy due to a lot of reading and high expectation for preparation.  MGMT 654, MGMT 611, or MGMT 612 is required as a prerequisite.  MGMT 721 can count towards the Entrepreneurial Management, Management, and Strategic Management majors. \r\n", "num_students": 61, "path": "/courses/27765/sections/002/reviews/3377-SAIKAT-CHAUDHURI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3377-SAIKAT-CHAUDHURI", "first_name": "SAIKAT", "last_name": "CHAUDHURI", "id": "3377-SAIKAT-CHAUDHURI", "name": "SAIKAT CHAUDHURI"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "27765-002-3377-SAIKAT-CHAUDHURI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.41", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.59", "rCourseQuality": "2.58", "rWorkRequired": "2.59", "rInstructorAccess": "2.95", "rReadingsValue": "2.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.36", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "CORP DEV: MERG & ACQUIS", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MGMT-721-701", "path": "/courses/27765/sections/701", "id": "27765-701", "aliases": ["MGMT-721-701"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/27765/sections/701/reviews/4431-HARBIR-SINGH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4431-HARBIR-SINGH", "first_name": "HARBIR", "last_name": "SINGH", "id": "4431-HARBIR-SINGH", "name": "HARBIR SINGH"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "27765-701-4431-HARBIR-SINGH"}]
