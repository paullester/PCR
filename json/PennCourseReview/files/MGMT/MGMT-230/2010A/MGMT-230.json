The course addresses both a theoretical perspective on venture initiation and the application of writing an actual business plan. \r\n\r\nStudent feedback for this course was mixed. Some students reported gaining \u201cvaluable knowledge about enterpreneurship and writing a business plan\u201d but many students reported \u201clearning very little in class.\u201d One student commented, \u201cI'm not walking away with too much tangible knowledge. I did feel like I learned some important life lessons, however.\u201d On a whole, students were unsatisfied with the overall structure of the class.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, student feedback on Professor Gelburd varied significantly. A few students agreed that \u201cProfessor Gelburd is a fantastic instructor\u201d but many criticized his incorporation of \u201cway too many guest speakers\u201d which made the class feel \u201chaphazard.\u201d There were many guest speakers. One student commented that \u201cthe added value of guest speakers and real-world experience information is incredible\u201d but many felt that there were \u201ctoo many guest speakers which took away from the class objective.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the main requirements is to write a business plan which students agreed \u201crequired a great deal of time.\u201d Some students wished that they received more specific guidelines for the final presentation. One student commented that \u201cAssigned readings were very out-dated and I found them not helpful at all. However, I learned very much through the business-plan project (much more than in my other Wharton courses) and this class has really changed the way I view entrepreneurship and changed my career outlook and I am grateful for that.\u201d", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/26374/sections/001/reviews/3064-LAWRENCE-GELBURD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3064-LAWRENCE-GELBURD", "first_name": "LAWRENCE", "last_name": "GELBURD", "id": "3064-LAWRENCE-GELBURD", "name": "LAWRENCE GELBURD"}, "num_reviewers": 49, "id": "26374-001-3064-LAWRENCE-GELBURD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-230", "path": "/courses/26374", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26374/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-230-001", "path": "/courses/26374/sections/001", "id": "26374-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-230-001"]}]}, "id": 26374, "aliases": ["MGMT-230"]}
