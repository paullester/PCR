{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4331"}, "description": "This course is directed toward the attainment of five interdependent objectives 1) to develop an understanding of strategy implementation in complex organizations; 2) to understand how organizational planning, design, control and human resource decisions are interdependent and critical to successful implementation; 3) to develop a sensitivity to the \"realities\" of strategy implementation in \"real world\" organizations; 4) to obtain a deeper understanding of your personal management style and how it may help or hinder strategy implementation; and 5) to become a better communicator and implementer of strategy. To meet these course objectives, the emphasis will be on learning powerful ideas about how to be systematic in strategy implementation efforts, making use of research about case problems, class discussions, in class exercises, and student presentations. Much of the learning will take place in group discussions outside the classroom in preparation for the time we meet in the classroom. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27770/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.52", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "1.48", "rRecommendMajor": "1.52", "rCourseQuality": "1.35", "rWorkRequired": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.22", "rReadingsValue": "2.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.91", "rCommAbility": "1.61", "rInstructorQuality": "1.55"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-001", "path": "/courses/27770/sections/001", "id": "27770-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-001"]}, "comments": "MGMT 782 is directed toward the attainment of five interdependent objectives 1) to develop an understanding of strategy implementation in complex organizations; 2) to understand how organizational planning, design, control and human resource decisions are interdependent and critical to successful implementation; 3) to develop a sensitivity to the \"realities\" of strategy implementation in \"real world\" organizations; 4) to obtain a deeper understanding of your personal management style and how it may help or hinder strategy implementation; and 5) to become a better communicator and implementer of strategy.

Although the course took a new direction during the second half of the course due to student feedback, many students lost interest and felt that the class did not add value in terms of subject matter or conceptual frameworks. Overall, there was little class flow and in one students words, \u201copinions on subjective issues were shot down if they were different from the instructor\u2019s.\u201d \r\n\tStudents felt that Professor Murmann needed to revamp his teaching format. While they appreciated his enthusiasm and passion for the subject, they wished Professor Murmann had instead, \u201cincorporated a wider range of examples\u201d and had set \u201cclear expectations and guidelines for assignments.\u201d Professor Murmann was depicted as not being able to engage the class in discussion and debate and classes were full of \u201cawkward silences.\u201d\r\n\tThe class was an elective for MBA graduate management students. Students commented that there were too many activities and not enough emphasis on any particular one. The workload was described as appropriate but some students only stayed in the class \u201cbecause it was a requirement.\u201d There are no prerequisites for this course.\r\n", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/27770/sections/001/reviews/6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN", "first_name": "JOHANN PETER", "last_name": "MURMANN", "id": "6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN", "name": "JOHANN PETER MURMANN"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "27770-001-6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.44", "rDifficulty": "1.85", "rStimulateInterest": "1.37", "rRecommendMajor": "1.22", "rCourseQuality": "1.28", "rWorkRequired": "2.48", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "1.81", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.67", "rCommAbility": "1.56", "rInstructorQuality": "1.61"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-002", "path": "/courses/27770/sections/002", "id": "27770-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/27770/sections/002/reviews/6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN", "first_name": "JOHANN PETER", "last_name": "MURMANN", "id": "6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN", "name": "JOHANN PETER MURMANN"}, "num_reviewers": 37, "id": "27770-002-6125-JOHANN-PETER-MURMANN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.78", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rRecommendMajor": "2.72", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.11", "rInstructorQuality": "2.84"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-701", "path": "/courses/27770/sections/701", "id": "27770-701", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-701"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/27770/sections/701/reviews/3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "first_name": "LAWTON R", "last_name": "BURNS", "id": "3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS", "name": "LAWTON R BURNS"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "27770-701-3378-LAWTON-R-BURNS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-782", "path": "/courses/27770", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27770/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-001", "path": "/courses/27770/sections/001", "id": "27770-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-001"]}, {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-002", "path": "/courses/27770/sections/002", "id": "27770-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-002"]}, {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "701", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-701", "path": "/courses/27770/sections/701", "id": "27770-701", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-701"]}]}, "id": 27770, "aliases": ["MGMT-782"]}
