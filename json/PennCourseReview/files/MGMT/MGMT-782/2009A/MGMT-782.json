{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4331"}, "description": "This course is directed toward the attainment of five interdependent objectives 1) to develop an understanding of strategy implementation in complex organizations; 2) to understand how organizational planning, design, control and human resource decisions are interdependent and critical to successful implemetation; 3) to develop a sensitivity to the \"realities\" of strategy implementation in \"real world\" organizations; 4) to obtain a deeper understanding of your personal management style and how it may help or hinder strategy implementation; and 5) to become a better communicator and implementer of strategy. To meet these course objectives, the emphasis will be on learning powerful ideas about how to be systematic in strategy implementation efforts, making use of research about case problems, class discussions, in class exercises, and student presentations. Much of the learning will take place in group discussions outside the classroom in preparation for the time we meet in the classroom. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16095/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.08", "rDifficulty": "1.82", "rStimulateInterest": "2.49", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.17", "rWorkRequired": "1.96", "rInstructorAccess": "2.66", "rReadingsValue": "2.47", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.98", "rCommAbility": "2.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-001", "path": "/courses/16095/sections/001", "id": "16095-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 54, "path": "/courses/16095/sections/001/reviews/4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK", "first_name": "LAWRENCE G", "last_name": "HREBINIAK", "id": "4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK", "name": "LAWRENCE G HREBINIAK"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "16095-001-4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.10", "rDifficulty": "1.84", "rStimulateInterest": "2.61", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.22", "rWorkRequired": "1.94", "rInstructorAccess": "2.98", "rReadingsValue": "2.37", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.96", "rCommAbility": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "2.74"}, "section": {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-002", "path": "/courses/16095/sections/002", "id": "16095-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/16095/sections/002/reviews/4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK", "first_name": "LAWRENCE G", "last_name": "HREBINIAK", "id": "4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK", "name": "LAWRENCE G HREBINIAK"}, "num_reviewers": 51, "id": "16095-002-4434-LAWRENCE-G-HREBINIAK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-782", "path": "/courses/16095", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16095/sections", "values": [{"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-001", "path": "/courses/16095/sections/001", "id": "16095-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-001"]}, {"name": "STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-782-002", "path": "/courses/16095/sections/002", "id": "16095-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-782-002"]}]}, "id": 16095, "aliases": ["MGMT-782"]}
