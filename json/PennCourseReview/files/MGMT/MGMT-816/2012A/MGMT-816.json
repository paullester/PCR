{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5441"}, "description": "This elective half-semester course explores issues pertaining to building and managing human assets in a high-growth entrepreneurial setting. The purpose of this case-driven course is to develop the skills necessary to think systematically and strategically about management of human assets in an entrepreneurial firm and to develop the competencies necessary to design and implement human resource systems that support entrepreneurial firms. We will focus on the following objectives: identifying the talent needed to initiate and sustain an entrepreneurial endeavor; structuring human resource policies and corporate culture to prepare for and facilitate firm growth; assessing the human aspects of valuing entrepreneurial companies; and responding to conflict and organizational threats within nascent firms. This course will apply recent research from strategic human resource management, personnel economics and organizational behavior to the practical issues of building and managing human assets in new ventures. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "BLDG.
