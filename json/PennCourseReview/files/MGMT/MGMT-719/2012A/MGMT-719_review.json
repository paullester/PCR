We shall explore the role of transaction costs, complementary assets, incentives, routines and organizational rigidity in the context vertical integration, horizontal diversification, market entry and scaling up. Consequently, students who take this course will develop a sophisticated basis for creating and evaluating growth strategies. Classroom time is devoted primarily to lively discussion of the cases and assigned readings. There are also two group case write-ups and a final exam. \r\nStudents overall thought this class was \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cengaging.\u201d Most students stressed that there was a \u201ctheoretical\u201d focus, with a \u201cpretty academic approach to strategy.\u201d One student noted that therefore \u201csome cases did not meet the standards of rigor set by the course theory.\u201d Another student noted that this class contains \u201cimportant concepts that I will apply as a manager within a firm.\u201d However, one student found the course to be \u201coverall confusing\u201d and that it \u201csometimes lost sight of application to the real world\u201d.\r\n The majority of students loved Professor Rawley because he is \u201cnaturally curious\u201d an \u201ceffective communicator,\u201d \u201cchallenges students to approach managerial issues in new ways,\u201d and is \u201cable to connect with the class.\u201d One student noted that he \u201cbecame more comfortable as the class progressed\u201d and another student said that he is \u201caccommodating to everyone\u2019s needs.\u201d However, a few students thought that Professor Rawley presented \u201cmaterial in an overly academic way\u201d which \u201cimpedes learning\u201d and that he should \u201ctake better control of the classroom.\u201d\r\nStudents did not like how the \u201cbasic learning\u2019s of the theoretical principals\u201d allowed great understanding. Students did not complain about difficulty. This course is an upper level MGMT course and its prerequisites are MGMT611 or 612. Since this is an advanced course that moves at a very rapid pace and builds on material covered in a number of core courses it is primarily geared toward second year MBA students and is only appropriate for the most advanced first year graduate students.\r\n", "num_students": 56, "path": "/courses/27764/sections/004/reviews/4887-EVAN-T--RAWLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4887-EVAN-T--RAWLEY", "first_name": "EVAN T.", "last_name": "RAWLEY", "id": "4887-EVAN-T--RAWLEY", "name": "EVAN T.
