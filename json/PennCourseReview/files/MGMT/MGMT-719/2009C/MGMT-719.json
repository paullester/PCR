{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4609"}, "description": "This course examines the economic factors underlying value creation in organizational strategy. We shall explore the role of transaction costs, complementary assets, incentives, routines and organizational rigidity in the context vertical integration, horizontal diversification, market entry and scaling up. Consequently, students who take this course will develop a sophisticated basis for creating and evaluating growth strategies. Classroom time is devoted primarily to lively discussion of the cases and assigned readings. There are also two group case write-ups and a final exam. Because this is an advanced course that moves at a very rapid pace and builds on material covered in a number of core courses it is primarily geared toward second year MBA students and is only appropriate for the most advanced first year graduate students. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ORGANIZ ECON & STRAT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17703/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.29", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.39", "rCourseQuality": "2.43", "rWorkRequired": "2.96", "rInstructorAccess": "3.46", "rReadingsValue": "2.39", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "2.46", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANIZ ECON & STRAT", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-719-002", "path": "/courses/17703/sections/002", "id": "17703-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-719-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 42, "path": "/courses/17703/sections/002/reviews/4887-EVAN-T--RAWLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4887-EVAN-T--RAWLEY", "first_name": "EVAN T.", "last_name": "RAWLEY", "id": "4887-EVAN-T--RAWLEY", "name": "EVAN T.
