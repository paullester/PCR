The course examines ways to profitably launch and exploit business opportunities (as opposed to what opportunity to explore). It allows students to acquire the skill set necessary for crafting winning business models for their ventures - developing and writing coherent and effective plans to start a business in either an independent or a corporate setting. The venture must distinguish itself from existing companies through differential innovation; for example, through an innovative product or service, an innovative production process, a new business model, or by creating a new market.\r\nStudents universally praised MGMT 806 and declared that it was \u201can essential course for those trying to start their own business.\u201d  They \u201clearned a lot\u201d and felt that they were \u201cgoing to apply the topics covered during the course.\u201d  A few students had suggestions for improving the course, such as having the talks from guest entrepreneurs discuss more specific topics, focusing more on a \u201cpolished pitch deck and maybe even a demo product,\u201d and getting \u201cmore feedback from VCs,\u201d but overall, even those students with suggestions \u201cemphatically recommend[ed] the course.\u201d\r\nStudents really appreciated the opportunity to work with Professor Fitzgerald, and they all felt he was \u201ca great professor\u201d with a \u201cno-nonsense, to-the-point approach that is exactly what is required of entrepreneurs in the real world.\u201d  One student declared that Professor Fitzgerald is \u201cprobably the best resource on campus\u201d for students looking to start a business and another noted that he \u201cmade an effort to be as available to students as possible.\u201d\r\nStudents emphasized that the course \u201creally should be taken for people who know they are going to start a business and have a specific business idea to work on.\u201d MGMT 806 is an MBA course that can count towards the Entrepreneurial Management and Management majors.  MGMT 801 is a prerequisite.  \r\n", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/27775/sections/001/reviews/5420-PATRICK-FITZGERALD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5420-PATRICK-FITZGERALD", "first_name": "PATRICK", "last_name": "FITZGERALD", "id": "5420-PATRICK-FITZGERALD", "name": "PATRICK FITZGERALD"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "27775-001-5420-PATRICK-FITZGERALD"}]
