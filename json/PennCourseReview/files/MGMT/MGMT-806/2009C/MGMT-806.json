{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4335"}, "description": "This advanced course in entrepreneurship centers on writing a comprehensive business plan and implementation plan for a venture of your choice. The course examines ways to profitably launch and exploit business opportunities (as opposed to what opportunity to explore). It will allow you to acquire the skill set necessary for crafting a winning business model for your venture - developing and writing a coherent and effective plan to start a business in either an independent or a corporate setting. The venture must distinguish itself from existing companies through differential innovation; for example, through an innovative product or service, an innovative production process, a new business model, or by creating a new market. Students must have successfully completed MGMT 801 before enrolling in this course. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "FORMATION & IMPLEMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17711/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.63", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "1.88", "rRecommendMajor": "2.00", "rCourseQuality": "1.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.54", "rInstructorAccess": "2.65", "rReadingsValue": "1.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.17", "rCommAbility": "2.04", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "FORMATION & IMPLEMENT", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "MGMT-806-751", "path": "/courses/17711/sections/751", "id": "17711-751", "aliases": ["MGMT-806-751"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 37, "path": "/courses/17711/sections/751/reviews/3070-RONALD-PIERANTOZZI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3070-RONALD-PIERANTOZZI", "first_name": "RONALD", "last_name": "PIERANTOZZI", "id": "3070-RONALD-PIERANTOZZI", "name": "RONALD PIERANTOZZI"}, "num_reviewers": 26, "id": "17711-751-3070-RONALD-PIERANTOZZI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-806", "path": "/courses/17711", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17711/sections", "values": [{"name": "FORMATION & IMPLEMENT", "sectionnum": "751", "primary_alias": "MGMT-806-751", "path": "/courses/17711/sections/751", "id": "17711-751", "aliases": ["MGMT-806-751"]}]}, "id": 17711, "aliases": ["MGMT-806"]}
