The course will consist of a combination of lectures, case studies, presentations by industry experts, and a short evening field trip.\r\n\tThe majority of students thoroughly enjoyed the class, with many students calling it \u201cone of the best courses taken at Wharton.\u201d Most students thought highly of the class organization and especially looked forward to the speakers and case studies.
