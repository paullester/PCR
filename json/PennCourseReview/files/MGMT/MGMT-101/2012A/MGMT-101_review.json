It provides a framework for understanding issues involved in both managing and being managed, and it will help students to be a more effective contributor to organizations that they join. The course will develop a \"systems\" view of organizations, which means examining organizations as part of a context, including but not limited to environment, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people and outputs. The course considers how managerial decisions made in any one of these domains affect decisions in each of the others.\r\nThe course was very qualitative, which frustrated some students because they felt that the material was \u201cguesswork\u201d and there was no correct answer, given several schools of thought. It provided a \u201cdecent introduction to management for a business student\u201d but most students found the material to be dull.\r\nProfessor Haas \u201cdid a great job stimulating student interest in the course and communicating the course concepts. The polls, video clips, and other interactive elements were great additions that helped students to remember how to apply the course concepts.\u201d Professor Haas incorporated real-life examples into lecture, which helped students grasp the concepts better.\r\nManagement 101 is a part of the Wharton core and required for all Wharton undergraduates. \u201cThe tests for this course have extremely tight distributions, and are somewhat subjective. This means a simple mistake or two will severely impact the grade.\u201d Some students would have liked \u201cmore transparency\u201d given the subjectivity of grading.  Overall, the \u201ccourse material is not challenging\u201d but did require extensive memorization. Students needed to participate during recitation, which made some discussions seem \u201ccontrived.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/27743/sections/001/reviews/6120-MARTINE-R--HAAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6120-MARTINE-R--HAAS", "first_name": "MARTINE R.", "last_name": "HAAS", "id": "6120-MARTINE-R--HAAS", "name": "MARTINE R.
