It highlights critical management issues involved in planning, organizing, controlling and leading an organization. This course helps students to understand some of the issues involved in both managing and being managed and equips them to become more effective contributors to organizations that they join. The course covers several topics in management, organization and strategy. Each topic spans one or two weeks. Topics include combinations of the following areas: organizational structure, organizational culture, strategy, interorganizational relationships, job design, groups, reward systems, work force composition, power and politics, social responsibility, organizational change, organizational decision-making, business history. The professor covers an overview of the topic with frameworks and examples in the lecture and the teaching assistant leads a case discussion that integrates these frameworks in the recitation.\r\n\r\nThis course received mixed reviews.  Several students spoke positively of the lectures, describing them as \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cfun.\u201d  In particular, a few students noted the use of \u201caudience participation, multimedia, and polls\u201d in making lectures more \u201cengaging.  However, many students also felt that they did not learn as much as they could have and expressed the concern that \u201ccoverage was very basic and lacked depth.\u201d \r\n\r\nAlthough several students disliked the course, students had only positive things to say about Professor Rosenkopf.  Students described her as \u201ca great lecturer\u201d who \u201cmakes her lessons interesting and engaging.\u201d         \r\n\r\nStudents in this course complete case studies, participate in online discussions, and take exams.  There are no prerequisites for MGMT 101 and it is part of the Wharton core.\r\n", "num_students": 112, "path": "/courses/24734/sections/003/reviews/2550-LORI-ROSENKOPF", "instructor": {"path":
