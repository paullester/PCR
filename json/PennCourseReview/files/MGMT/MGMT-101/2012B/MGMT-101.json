{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/740"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to the critical management skills involved in planning, structuring, controlling and leading an organization. It provides a framework for understanding issues involved in both managing and being managed, and it will help you to be a more effective contributor to organizations that you join. We develop a \"systems\" view of organizations, which means that we examine organizations as part of a context, including but not limited to environment, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people and outputs. We consider how managerial decisions made in any one of these domains affect decisions in each of the others. \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28396/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.38", "rDifficulty": "2.66", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.03", "rCourseQuality": "2.35", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "2.56", "rReadingsValue": "2.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.84", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.03"}, "section": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "MGMT-101-910", "path": "/courses/28396/sections/910", "id": "28396-910", "aliases": ["MGMT-101-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/28396/sections/910/reviews/5785-NICOLE-A-ROSENKRANZ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5785-NICOLE-A-ROSENKRANZ", "first_name": "NICOLE A", "last_name": "ROSENKRANZ", "id": "5785-NICOLE-A-ROSENKRANZ", "name": "NICOLE A ROSENKRANZ"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "28396-910-5785-NICOLE-A-ROSENKRANZ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-101", "path": "/courses/28396", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28396/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "MGMT-101-910", "path": "/courses/28396/sections/910", "id": "28396-910", "aliases": ["MGMT-101-910"]}]}, "id": 28396, "aliases": ["MGMT-101"]}
