{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4327"}, "description": "This course focuses on the role of professionals in creating value through transaction engineering. The overall goal of the course is to explain how private parties actually order their commercial interactions and to develop a relatively systematic theory of how they ought to do this. The first half of the course will be devoted to impediments to transacting including asymmetric information problems, difficulties intrinsic to contracting over time, enforceability, and various forms of strategic behavior and to a variety of possible responses rooted in decision theory, option theory, techniques for minimizing information problems, risk management, and incentive alignment. In the second half of the course, student teams will apply the tools developed in the first half to a series of real transactions. That part of the course will be described in a separate memo to be circulated once the roster of deals is fixed. Enrollment will be restricted this year to 48, of whom 24 will be second-year MBA students and 24 will be upper class Law students. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "DEALS: ECON STRUC TRANS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26393/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.93", "rDifficulty": "2.43", "rStimulateInterest": "1.71", "rRecommendMajor": "2.64", "rCourseQuality": "2.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.14", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.71", "rCommAbility": "2.21", "rInstructorQuality": "2.19"}, "section": {"name": "DEALS: ECON STRUC TRANS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-717-001", "path": "/courses/26393/sections/001", "id": "26393-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-717-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/26393/sections/001/reviews/783-DANIEL-M-G--RAFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/783-DANIEL-M-G--RAFF", "first_name": "DANIEL M.G.", "last_name": "RAFF", "id": "783-DANIEL-M-G--RAFF", "name": "DANIEL M.G.
