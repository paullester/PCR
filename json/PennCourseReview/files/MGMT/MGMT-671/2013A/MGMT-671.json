{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4323"}, "description": "Leaders mobilize resources toward valued goals. In this course -- based on Prof. Stew Friedman's bestselling book, Total Leadership: Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life -- the focus is on growing the student's capacity as a leader in all parts of life. The purpose is to learn practical and customized lessons about how to improve performance and results at work, at home, in the community, and in the private self (mind, body, spirit) by finding mutual value among these four domains. The core idea is that leadership is about making a difference in all aspects of one's life; this course offers students the opportunity to practice the skills needed to do so, now and in the future. Students learn and apply key leadership principles and actively explore what it means for them to be real (to act with authenticity by clarifying what's important), to be whole (to act with integrity by respecting the whole person), and to be innovative (to act with creativity by experimenting with how things get done).
