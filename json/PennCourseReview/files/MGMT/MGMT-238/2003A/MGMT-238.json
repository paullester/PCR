{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/749"}, "description": "Management 238 is the standard undergraduate course in Organizational Behavior. The course deals essentially with the management of people at work. It examines the individual employee in his organizational environment, as well as the organization itself. Topics range from motivation, leadership groups all the way to organization structure, culture, human resources and organizational change. The course develops some themes in which these topics become relevant -- for example the networking organization and diversity at the workplace. Students should expect to conduct group projects involving actual fieldwork and might be asked to give a presentation in class. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1917/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-238-001", "path": "/courses/1917/sections/001", "id": "1917-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-238-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/1917/sections/001/reviews/804-STEFFANIE-L-WILK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/804-STEFFANIE-L-WILK", "first_name": "STEFFANIE L", "last_name": "WILK", "id": "804-STEFFANIE-L-WILK", "name": "STEFFANIE L WILK"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "1917-001-804-STEFFANIE-L-WILK"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.53", "rDifficulty": "2.07", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "2.93", "rReadingsValue": "2.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.20", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-238-002", "path": "/courses/1917/sections/002", "id": "1917-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-238-002"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/1917/sections/002/reviews/802-ROBERT-J-HOUSE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/802-ROBERT-J-HOUSE", "first_name": "ROBERT J", "last_name": "HOUSE", "id": "802-ROBERT-J-HOUSE", "name": "ROBERT J HOUSE"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "1917-002-802-ROBERT-J-HOUSE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MGMT-238", "path": "/courses/1917", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1917/sections", "values": [{"name": "ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MGMT-238-001", "path": "/courses/1917/sections/001", "id": "1917-001", "aliases": ["MGMT-238-001"]}, {"name": "ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR", "sectionnum": "002", "primary_alias": "MGMT-238-002", "path": "/courses/1917/sections/002", "id": "1917-002", "aliases": ["MGMT-238-002"]}]}, "id": 1917, "aliases": ["MGMT-238"]}
