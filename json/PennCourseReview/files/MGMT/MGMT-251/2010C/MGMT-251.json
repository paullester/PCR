It is in a sense a capstone course since it asks students to apply knowledge and modes of analysis acquired in other courses to issues confronting actual businesses. Issues addressed span a range of functional areas including strategic planning, financial analysis, marketing strategy, competitive analysis, organizational structure, and capital raising.\r\n\r\nSeveral students said this class was the best they have taken at Penn.
