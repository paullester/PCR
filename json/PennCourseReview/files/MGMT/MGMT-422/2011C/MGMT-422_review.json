The course aims to enable managers to understand the human aspects of his or her job and adapt this knowledge to the efficient use of human resources. It emphasizes overall management responsibilities relating to HR rather than the procedural aspects of personnel management.\r\n\r\nStudents found the subject area of this course to be \u201cdry,\u201d especially the way it was presented in the textbook. Students felt that an inordinate amount of time was spent on legal topics, which were especially dull. However, students also reported that this class is helpful because it \u201ccovered all the pertinent areas of HR.\u201d \r\n\r\nOverall, students found Professor Francesco to be a knowledgeable and interesting professor. They applauded Professor Francesco\u2019s \u201cability to express the material\u201d and thought she was \u201cvery passionate about HR.\u201d In addition, they thought Professor Francesco was organized, and that her assignments were helpful in learning the material. \r\n\r\nThough students enjoyed Professor Francesco\u2019s presentation of the material, they found that the projects assigned were too time consuming to count for only 25% of the overall grade. One student reported that the class \u201crarely made it through an entire lecture, which was a shame,\u201d and that there were several topics that were self-taught.
