{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5329"}, "description": "This course will advance students' bilingual and bicultural competence to enhance their knowledge and ability to work in the Indian business context. As part of the course the students will learn about the content and culture of Indian business as it operates nationally and internationally. They will get exposed to issues relevant to conducting business in or with India and learn about diverse cultural nuances (such as rural-urban perspectives) that impact marketing strategies by analyzing Hindi advertisements. Also, students will engage with the content and language through guest lectures, print and audio-video texts gathered from national and international media, such as VOA, BBC, and Business Standard. By the end of the semester, students are expected to enhance their knowledge about Indian business, gain linguistic competence (lexical, socio-cultural and pragmatic) to increase their confidence and comfort level in business domains, and access culturally embedded viewpoints about local and global business issues. In order to demonstrate the above, students will engage in projects that will require them to do research, conduct interviews and make presentations of their findings. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "BUSINESS HINDI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26176/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.83", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.80", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "BUSINESS HINDI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIND-460-001", "path": "/courses/26176/sections/001", "id": "26176-001", "aliases": ["HIND-460-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/26176/sections/001/reviews/1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "first_name": "VIJAY", "last_name": "GAMBHIR", "id": "1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR", "name": "VIJAY GAMBHIR"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "26176-001-1072-VIJAY-GAMBHIR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIND-460", "path": "/courses/26176", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26176/sections", "values": [{"name": "BUSINESS HINDI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "HIND-460-001", "path": "/courses/26176/sections/001", "id": "26176-001", "aliases": ["HIND-460-001"]}]}, "id": 26176, "aliases": ["HIND-460"]}
