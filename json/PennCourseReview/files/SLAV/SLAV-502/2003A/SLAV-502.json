{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1506"}, "description": "This course is a continuation of the SLAV501 680. This is for students who want to acquire the linguistic skills necessary for communication in everyday situations and that would constitute a solid base for further study of the Polish language. In addition students will become acquainted with various aspects of Polish culture (including Polish films), history and contemporary affairs. Students will learn through classroom exercises based on a modern textbook, completion of individual and group assignments and work with various audio and video materials. The textbook Hurra - Po Polsku 1 is written in the spirit of the communicative approach, which makes it possible to communicate from the very beginning of the learning process. The special attention, however, will be paid on systematic development of all language skills: listening, reading, speaking and writing. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ELEMENTARY POLISH II", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2216/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.83", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY POLISH II", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "SLAV-502-680", "path": "/courses/2216/sections/680", "id": "2216-680", "aliases": ["SLAV-502-680"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/2216/sections/680/reviews/1082-ELIZABETH-SACHS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1082-ELIZABETH-SACHS", "first_name": "ELIZABETH", "last_name": "SACHS", "id": "1082-ELIZABETH-SACHS", "name": "ELIZABETH SACHS"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "2216-680-1082-ELIZABETH-SACHS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SLAV-502", "path": "/courses/2216", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2216/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY POLISH II", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "SLAV-502-680", "path": "/courses/2216/sections/680", "id": "2216-680", "aliases": ["SLAV-502-680"]}]}, "id": 2216, "aliases": ["SLAV-502"]}
