{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1499"}, "description": "Despite increasing popular interest in them, the Indian religious traditions (Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Buddhist) that are commonly called Tantra or Tantric, and that are often associated with transgressive practices such as the ritual consumption of alcohol and ritual sexual intercourse, have until recently received relatively little attention from Indologists and historians of religion. This course will examine the rise of these traditions, their development, and their interactions with each other. Reactions to and criticism of Tantra from the side of non-tantric Indian religious traditions will also be considered. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "INTRO TO TANTRA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2209/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.63", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "2.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO TANTRA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-401-401", "path": "/courses/2209/sections/401", "id": "2209-401", "aliases": ["SARS-401-401", "RELS-461-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/2209/sections/401/reviews/1241-HARUNAGA-ISAACSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1241-HARUNAGA-ISAACSON", "first_name": "HARUNAGA", "last_name": "ISAACSON", "id": "1241-HARUNAGA-ISAACSON", "name": "HARUNAGA ISAACSON"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "2209-401-1241-HARUNAGA-ISAACSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-401", "path": "/courses/2209", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2209/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO TANTRA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-401-401", "path": "/courses/2209/sections/401", "id": "2209-401", "aliases": ["SARS-401-401", "RELS-461-401"]}]}, "id": 2209, "aliases": ["SARS-401", "RELS-461"]}
