Emphasis on applying consistent critical criteria in the analysis of ancient materials and traditions concerning Jesus, from whatever source (opponents, enthusiastic advocates, relatively uninvolved reporters). Problems encountered by any historian dealing with any subject of which the historian was not an eyewitness will be illustrated and elaborated in the investigation of what is known about Jesus. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "SOURCES: LIFE OF JESUS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3461/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.83", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "SOURCES: LIFE OF JESUS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RELS-435-301", "path": "/courses/3461/sections/301", "id": "3461-301", "aliases": ["RELS-435-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/3461/sections/301/reviews/1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT", "first_name": "ROBERT A", "last_name": "KRAFT", "id": "1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT", "name": "ROBERT A KRAFT"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "3461-301-1056-ROBERT-A-KRAFT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-435", "path": "/courses/3461", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3461/sections", "values": [{"name": "SOURCES: LIFE OF JESUS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RELS-435-301", "path": "/courses/3461/sections/301", "id": "3461-301", "aliases": ["RELS-435-301"]}]}, "id": 3461, "aliases": ["RELS-435"]}
