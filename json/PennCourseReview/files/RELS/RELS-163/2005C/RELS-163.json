{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2104"}, "description": "This course will survey the many religious traditions that we now call Hinduism. Covering over 4,000 years of history, we will examine points of contact between cultures and peoples to understand how Hinduism has Hinduism has been shaped, changed, and brought together over time. We will examine primary source readings in the Vedas, Upanishads, Epics (Ramayana and Mahabharata), Puranas, inscriptions, medieval devotional literature and modern reformists' works. Sculpture, temple architecture, and painting, coupled with videos of contemporary rituals will help us to understand the importance of visual culture in Hinduism, and illuminate the changes and continuities in practices over time. Concepts such as dharma, karma, and moksha, will be placed into the contexts of the lives Hindus have led throughout history, and aid in a critical examination of topicssuch as caste, gender, power, and nationalism. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "INTRO TO HINDUISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12391/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "2.94", "rCourseQuality": "2.41", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.56", "rCommAbility": "2.65", "rInstructorQuality": "2.76"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO HINDUISM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "RELS-163-601", "path": "/courses/12391/sections/601", "id": "12391-601", "aliases": ["RELS-163-601", "SAST-163-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/12391/sections/601/reviews/1703-SUCHARITA-ADLURI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1703-SUCHARITA-ADLURI", "first_name": "SUCHARITA", "last_name": "ADLURI", "id": "1703-SUCHARITA-ADLURI", "name": "SUCHARITA ADLURI"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "12391-601-1703-SUCHARITA-ADLURI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-163", "path": "/courses/12391", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12391/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO HINDUISM", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "RELS-163-601", "path": "/courses/12391/sections/601", "id": "12391-601", "aliases": ["RELS-163-601", "SAST-163-601"]}]}, "id": 12391, "aliases": ["RELS-163", "SAST-163"]}
