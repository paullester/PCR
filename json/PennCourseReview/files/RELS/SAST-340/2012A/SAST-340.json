{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5476"}, "description": "Instead of engaging with the religious precepts of \"official religions\", such as Hinduism, Islam and Christianity, in South Asia, this course will explore South Asian \"popular\" religions primary in their socio-historical-cultural contexts. As a survey course on South Asian popular religions, the course will take as its starting point 1300 CE as marking the birth of the popular devotional movement of Bhakti in medievil India. Specifically, the course will introduce students to the diverse roles that popular religions have come to play on specific South Asian societies. By stepping outside the theological domain of religions, the course will sensitise students to the complex and multifacted entanglements of religious behaviour with other domains of social activity. In so doing, it will also familiarise the students with some of the major theoretical orientations pertaining to the crosscuttings of popular religion with certain other categories of the 'social', i.e. caste, class, gender, etc. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "POP RELIGIONS IN S.
