Did Jesus see himself as a as a teacher and/or a revolutionary and/or the messiah? If Jesus and the apostles were all Jews, how did Christianity emerge as a distinct \"religion\"? And how is that this small Galilean and Judean movement came to shape world history and Western culture, even to this day?
