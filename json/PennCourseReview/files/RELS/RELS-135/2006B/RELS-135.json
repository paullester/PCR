{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/978"}, "description": "\"What can be known - from an historical perspective - about the life and teachings of Jesus and his earliest followers? Did Jesus see himself as a as a teacher and/or a revolutionary and/or the messiah? If Jesus and the apostles were all Jews, how did Christianity emerge as a distinct \"religion\"? And how is that this small Galilean and Judean movement came to shape world history and Western culture, even to this day? This course will explore these questions through a focus on the formation of the New Testament - from the letters of Paul in the early first century CE, to the collection and closure of the canon of Christian Scriptures in the fourth century CE.\" \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "CHRISTIAN ORIGINS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9872/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.64", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "CHRISTIAN ORIGINS", "sectionnum": "900", "primary_alias": "RELS-135-900", "path": "/courses/9872/sections/900", "id": "9872-900", "aliases": ["RELS-135-900"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/9872/sections/900/reviews/3615-HARRY-W--TOLLEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3615-HARRY-W--TOLLEY", "first_name": "HARRY W.", "last_name": "TOLLEY", "id": "3615-HARRY-W--TOLLEY", "name": "HARRY W.
