{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1489"}, "description": "In this course we will explore how religious life and ideals are expressed through various media, and how these media have affected cultural life in India. Our aim is two-fold: to acquire a familiarity with a variety of intriguing media forms-including traditional architecture, devotional poetry-music, visual-sensorial worship, modern film, recorded music, and television-and to situate these media within important cultural fields-religion, primarily, but also politics, popular culture, and global culture. Though much of our study will immerse us in India's past, our aim is to understand contemporary India and its religious culture through media. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "MEDIA & RELIGION IN S.A.", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2186/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.88", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.88", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "MEDIA & RELIGION IN S.A.", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-208-401", "path": "/courses/2186/sections/401", "id": "2186-401", "aliases": ["SARS-208-401", "RELS-568-401", "RELS-268-401", "SARS-508-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/2186/sections/401/reviews/1955-CHRISTIAN-LEE-NOVETZKE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1955-CHRISTIAN-LEE-NOVETZKE", "first_name": "CHRISTIAN LEE", "last_name": "NOVETZKE", "id": "1955-CHRISTIAN-LEE-NOVETZKE", "name": "CHRISTIAN LEE NOVETZKE"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "2186-401-1955-CHRISTIAN-LEE-NOVETZKE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SARS-208", "path": "/courses/2186", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2186/sections", "values": [{"name": "MEDIA & RELIGION IN S.A.", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SARS-208-401", "path": "/courses/2186/sections/401", "id": "2186-401", "aliases": ["SARS-208-401", "RELS-568-401", "RELS-268-401", "SARS-508-401"]}]}, "id": 2186, "aliases": ["SARS-208", "RELS-568", "RELS-268", "SARS-508"]}
