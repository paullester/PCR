{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3234"}, "description": "This seminar is an introduction to several aspects of the hotly debated relation between religion and public life in America. In the first half of the course we will study two books by law professors, one Jewish and the other Christian. Their debate will introduce us to the legal and historical background, and to the continuing challenges of church-state separation in America. The second half of the course will examine the claim that we now live in a \"new religious America,\" one in which the increasing presence of Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims has created a new pluralism and a new set of challenges. We will then consider the argument of one historian that diversity and difference have characterized religious groups in America since at least the l9th century, and that this has resulted in a number of paradoxical social situaitons. Finally, we will close with a brief look at the claim that there exists in America a \"civil religion,\" one that unites all citizens despite their other religious differences. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "RELIGION IN PUBLIC LIFE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8315/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.73", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "2.82", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "RELIGION IN PUBLIC LIFE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RELS-010-301", "path": "/courses/8315/sections/301", "id": "8315-301", "aliases": ["RELS-010-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/8315/sections/301/reviews/1052-STEPHEN-N-DUNNING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1052-STEPHEN-N-DUNNING", "first_name": "STEPHEN N", "last_name": "DUNNING", "id": "1052-STEPHEN-N-DUNNING", "name": "STEPHEN N DUNNING"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "8315-301-1052-STEPHEN-N-DUNNING"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-010", "path": "/courses/8315", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8315/sections", "values": [{"name": "RELIGION IN PUBLIC LIFE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "RELS-010-301", "path": "/courses/8315/sections/301", "id": "8315-301", "aliases": ["RELS-010-301"]}]}, "id": 8315, "aliases": ["RELS-010"]}
