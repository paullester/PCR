{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4118"}, "description": "Premodern India produced some of the world's greatest myths and stories: tales of gods, goddesses, heroes, princesses, kings and lovers that continue to capture the imaginations of millions of readers and hearers. In this course, we will look closely at some of these stories especially as found in Purana-s, great compendia composed in Sanskrit, including the chief stories of the central gods of Hinduism: Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess. We will also consider the relationship between these texts and the earlier myths of the Vedas and the Indian Epics, the diversity of the narrative and mythic materials within and across different texts, and the re-imagining of these stories in India's vernacular languages as well as in the modern world. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "HINDU MYTHOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26743/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.87", "rDifficulty": "1.44", "rStimulateInterest": "2.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.37", "rCourseQuality": "2.72", "rWorkRequired": "2.03", "rInstructorAccess": "3.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.51", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.95", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "HINDU MYTHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-006-401", "path": "/courses/26743/sections/401", "id": "26743-401", "aliases": ["SAST-006-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 49, "path": "/courses/26743/sections/401/reviews/1069-S-K-GAMBHIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1069-S-K-GAMBHIR", "first_name": "S K", "last_name": "GAMBHIR", "id": "1069-S-K-GAMBHIR", "name": "S K GAMBHIR"}, "num_reviewers": 47, "id": "26743-401-1069-S-K-GAMBHIR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-006", "path": "/courses/26743", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26743/sections", "values": [{"name": "HINDU MYTHOLOGY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-006-401", "path": "/courses/26743/sections/401", "id": "26743-401", "aliases": ["SAST-006-401"]}]}, "id": 26743, "aliases": ["SAST-006"]}
