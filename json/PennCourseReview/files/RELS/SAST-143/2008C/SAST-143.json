When did it become obvious that many religious practices in India should be grouped under the rubric 'Hinduism'? How has it come about that the most contentious issues in India today concern religion? This course invites students to formulate answers to these questions by critically examining decisive moments in recent Indian history including: missionary and colonial encounters with Indian religions, the making of Indian nationalism, anti-caste protests that attempt to redefine religion, and postcolonial secular state's attempts to determine Islamic law. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "RELIGION IN MODERN INDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19283/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "RELIGION IN MODERN INDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-143-401", "path": "/courses/19283/sections/401", "id": "19283-401", "aliases": ["SAST-143-401", "RELS-169-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/19283/sections/401/reviews/4972-RUPASHREE-VISWANATH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4972-RUPASHREE-VISWANATH", "first_name": "RUPASHREE", "last_name": "VISWANATH", "id": "4972-RUPASHREE-VISWANATH", "name": "RUPASHREE VISWANATH"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "19283-401-4972-RUPASHREE-VISWANATH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-143", "path": "/courses/19283", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19283/sections", "values": [{"name": "RELIGION IN MODERN INDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-143-401", "path": "/courses/19283/sections/401", "id": "19283-401", "aliases": ["SAST-143-401", "RELS-169-401"]}]}, "id": 19283, "aliases": ["SAST-143", "RELS-169"]}
