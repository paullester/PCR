{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4084"}, "description": "The famous boy king Tutanhkamun ascended the throne of Egypt at around ten years of age. His brief reign (1332-1332 BCE) came at the end of a tumultuous period in Egyptian history known to scholars today as the Amarna Period. Ushered in by his probable father, Akhenaten, the Amarna Period saw incredible changes in the traditional religion, art, architecture and language of ancient Egypt all brough about as a result of Akhenaten's devotion to a sole god, the Aten. What was Egyptian culture like before these kings? How abrupt was the chnage Akhenaten initiated? Why did it occur and why did Tutankhamun eventually reverse these changes? These and other questions will be addressed as we look at the Egyptian 18th Dynasty, the time when Egyptian civilization went through a period of upheavel and restoration. \n\nThis Spring, a new exhibit on the Amarna period (\"Amarna: Ancient Egypt's Place in the Sun\") is on display at the Penn Museum. At the same time, the city of Philadelphia is host to the blockbuster traveling exhibit, \"Tutankhamun and the gold Age of the Pharaohs\" which comes to the Franklin Institute in February 2006. This course will make use of both of these exhibits and will focus on this fascinating period of time during which King Tut lived and reigned, Egypt's New Kingdom (1539-1075 BCE). \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "WORLD OF TUTANKHAMUN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14867/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "1.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.89", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD OF TUTANKHAMUN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-063-401", "path": "/courses/14867/sections/401", "id": "14867-401", "aliases": ["NELC-063-401", "NELC-663-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/14867/sections/401/reviews/34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "first_name": "JENNIFER R.", "last_name": "HOUSER", "id": "34-JENNIFER-R--HOUSER", "name": "JENNIFER R.
