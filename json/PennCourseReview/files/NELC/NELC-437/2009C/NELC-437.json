{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3184"}, "description": "This comprehensive survey of the traditions of rational thought in classical Islamic culture is distinguished by its attempt to contextualize and localize the history of what is best described as philosophy in Islam, including not only the Islamic products of the Hellenistic mode of thought but also religious and linguistic sciences whose methodology is philosophical. Reading history as a set of local contingencies, the course examines the influence of these different disciplines upon each other, and the process of the Islamic \"aspecting\" of the Greek intellectual legacy. The readings thus include not only the works of Hellenized philosophers (falasifa) of Islam, but also those of theologians (mutakallimun), legists (fiqh scholars), and grammarians (nahw/lugha scholars). No prerequisites. Additional advanced-level assignments can be given for graduate credit. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ISLAM INTELLECT TRADITIO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17787/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.67", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM INTELLECT TRADITIO", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "NELC-437-301", "path": "/courses/17787/sections/301", "id": "17787-301", "aliases": ["NELC-437-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/17787/sections/301/reviews/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "first_name": "JOSEPH E.", "last_name": "LOWRY", "id": "2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "name": "JOSEPH E.
