{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3929"}, "description": "This course provides a broad historical overview of Islam as a religion and explores the many ways in which Muslims have interpreted and put into practice the prophetic message of Muhammad through historical and social analyses of varying theological, philosophical, legal, political, mystical and literary writings, as well as through visual art and music. The course will use key moments in the history of Islam to examine notions of culture and civilization as they have been understood by Muslims in a variety of places and contexts. Starting with the Seljuk Empire in the 12th century, it will move forward in time -- touching on the Mongol conquests, the spread of Islam in Africa and South Asia, the Ottoman Empire and the modern world - as well as backward to to the life-time of Muhammad and the establishment of notions of orthodoxy and normativism in a classical age. Topics to be emphasized include the importance of religious charisma, scripture and text, the assertion of Sunnism as orthodoxy, nomadism and institutional religion, gender, law, and the role of material arts. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18019/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.93", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "3.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-145-401", "path": "/courses/18019/sections/401", "id": "18019-401", "aliases": ["RELS-145-401", "SAST-145-401", "NELC-185-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/18019/sections/401/reviews/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "first_name": "JAMAL J.", "last_name": "ELIAS", "id": "3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "name": "JAMAL J.
