{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3929"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the history of Islam as both a religion and as a civilization, from pre-Islamic Arabia to the rise of the gunpowder empires in the 16th century. The course will use key moments, texts, and figures in Islamic history to examine notions of religion, culture, and civilization as they have been understood by Muslims, in a variety of contexts, as well as the problems and politics surrounding the representation of Islamic history and Islam in the contemporary world. Some major topics to be covered include the development of Islamic institutions, the participation of Jews, Christians, and others in Islamic civilization, Arabic and Persian literature, as well as Europeans' encounters with Islam. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "ISLAMIC HIST & CULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30953/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAMIC HIST & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-145-401", "path": "/courses/30953/sections/401", "id": "30953-401", "aliases": ["RELS-145-401", "NELC-185-401", "SAST-145-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/30953/sections/401/reviews/6584-NICHOLAS-HARRIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6584-NICHOLAS-HARRIS", "first_name": "NICHOLAS", "last_name": "HARRIS", "id": "6584-NICHOLAS-HARRIS", "name": "NICHOLAS HARRIS"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "30953-401-6584-NICHOLAS-HARRIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RELS-145", "path": "/courses/30953", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30953/sections", "values": [{"name": "ISLAMIC HIST & CULTURE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-145-401", "path": "/courses/30953/sections/401", "id": "30953-401", "aliases": ["RELS-145-401", "NELC-185-401", "SAST-145-401"]}]}, "id": 30953, "aliases": ["RELS-145", "NELC-185", "SAST-145"]}
