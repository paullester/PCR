{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3186"}, "description": "Basing itself on the reading of select primary sources, the course will examine the traditional mystique of Islam in the West, and the images of Latin Christendom as they appear in Muslim texts. Who were the \"Saracens\" of the Latin Middle Ages? What was the Latin attitude to the Crusades and to jihad? And conversely, how did classical Muslim authors, chroniclers, and historians view Europe and the Christian world? And what was the extent of their knowledge? All these questions will be explored in a specific humanistic context: that of the monumental Latin appropriation of Islamic literary, artistic, and intellectual legacies. The course will end at a survey of modern encounter of islam with the West and the political tendencies, rhetoric, emotionalism, and the sense of \"otherness\" this newer encounter has generated. All readings in English. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "ISLAM & THE WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8097/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.60", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "2.20", "rCourseQuality": "2.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.20"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM & THE WEST", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "NELC-538-640", "path": "/courses/8097/sections/640", "id": "8097-640", "aliases": ["NELC-538-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/8097/sections/640/reviews/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "first_name": "S.
