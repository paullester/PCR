{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4362"}, "description": "Was Genghis Khan really such a bad guy after all? Were the Mongol Invasions of the 13th century really a disaster? It almost seems immoral to ask questions like this, but in this class we'll go ahead and ask them anyway. This course is a survey of the history of the medieval Mongol Empire, which, at its greatest extent, stretched from Korea to Germany. We will focus more specifically on that smaller Middle Eastern piece of the empire known as the Il-Khanate, which merely stretched from Turkey to Afghanistan, and made Iran a locus for synthesizing the cultures of Iran, the Arab world, Central Asia, and China. It also produced a lasting political, economic, and cultural legacy throughout much of the Middle East and beyond. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "THE MONGOL EXPERIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16172/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.46", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.62", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.92", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.42", "rCommAbility": "3.77", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "THE MONGOL EXPERIENCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NELC-234-001", "path": "/courses/16172/sections/001", "id": "16172-001", "aliases": ["NELC-234-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/16172/sections/001/reviews/4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB", "first_name": "PAUL MICHAEL", "last_name": "COBB", "id": "4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB", "name": "PAUL MICHAEL COBB"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "16172-001-4473-PAUL-MICHAEL-COBB"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-234", "path": "/courses/16172", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16172/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE MONGOL EXPERIENCE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NELC-234-001", "path": "/courses/16172/sections/001", "id": "16172-001", "aliases": ["NELC-234-001"]}]}, "id": 16172, "aliases": ["NELC-234"]}
