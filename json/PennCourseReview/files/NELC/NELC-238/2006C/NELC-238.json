{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3466"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to classical Islamic law, the all-embracing sacred law of Islam. Among the world's various legal systems, Islamic law may be the most widely misunderstood and even misrepresented; certainly, misconceptions about it abound. Islamic law is, however, the amazing product of a rich, fascinating and diverse cultural and intellectual tradition. Most of the readings in this course will be taken from primary sources in translation. Areas covered will include criminal law, family law, law in the Quran, gender and sexuality, the modern application of Islamic law, Islamic government and other selected topics. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "INTRO TO ISLAMIC LAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9287/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "3.22", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.78", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.22", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ISLAMIC LAW", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NELC-238-401", "path": "/courses/9287/sections/401", "id": "9287-401", "aliases": ["NELC-238-401", "RELS-248-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/9287/sections/401/reviews/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "first_name": "JOSEPH E.", "last_name": "LOWRY", "id": "2044-JOSEPH-E--LOWRY", "name": "JOSEPH E.
