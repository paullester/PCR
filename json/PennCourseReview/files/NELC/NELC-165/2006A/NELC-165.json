{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3181"}, "description": "This course will explore aspects of religious thought in the Eighteenth Dynasty, at the dawn of Egypt's imperial age (c. 1539-1295 BCE). Class lectures, slide presentations, and readings from selected texts in translation will provide insight into ancient beliefs concerning the judgment of the dead, personal relationships with the gods, and the Egyptian conception of Hell and the afterlife. Lectures will focus on the most important religiou compositions of the period, including the famous Book of the Dead and the mysterious Underworld Books. The course will also investigate the world's first religious reformation- the heresy of Akhenaten- and the \"counter-reformation\" of the boy-king Tutankhamun. An examination of the art, architecture, and literature of the period will shed light on related issues, including the existence of philosophy before the Greeks, and the possible Egyptian origins of monotheism over the course of Egypt's glorious \"golden age.\" \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "The Mind of Egypt in New Kingdom:Religious Thought from the Age of King Tut", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8092/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "The Mind of Egypt in New Kingdom:Religious Thought from the Age of King Tut", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "NELC-165-601", "path": "/courses/8092/sections/601", "id": "8092-601", "aliases": ["NELC-165-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/8092/sections/601/reviews/3091-JOSHUA-ROBERSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3091-JOSHUA-ROBERSON", "first_name": "JOSHUA", "last_name": "ROBERSON", "id": "3091-JOSHUA-ROBERSON", "name": "JOSHUA ROBERSON"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "8092-601-3091-JOSHUA-ROBERSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NELC-165", "path": "/courses/8092", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8092/sections", "values": [{"name": "The Mind of Egypt in New Kingdom:Religious Thought from the Age of King Tut", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "NELC-165-601", "path": "/courses/8092/sections/601", "id": "8092-601", "aliases": ["NELC-165-601"]}]}, "id": 8092, "aliases": ["NELC-165"]}
