{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5159"}, "description": "The purpose of the course is to achieve an understanding of events occurring in the Islamic world by studying how Muslims view themselves and the world they live in. Beginning with a discussion of the impact of colonialism, we will examine Islamic ideas and trends from the late colonial period until the present. Readings will include religions, political and literary writings by important Muslim figures. Movements, events and central issues (e.g. the changing status of women and relations between the Islamic world and the West) will be examined in the context of modern nation states. Special attention will be paid to contesting forms of Islam in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries and to contesting forms of Islam in the United States, both among converts and immigrants. One of the main objectives is to show that what appear to be similar movements in the Islamic World are, in fact, widely disparate in their origins and goals. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "ISLAM IN MODERN WORLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29601/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM IN MODERN WORLD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-146-401", "path": "/courses/29601/sections/401", "id": "29601-401", "aliases": ["RELS-146-401", "SAST-146-401", "NELC-184-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 27, "path": "/courses/29601/sections/401/reviews/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "first_name": "JAMAL J.", "last_name": "ELIAS", "id": "3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "name": "JAMAL J.
