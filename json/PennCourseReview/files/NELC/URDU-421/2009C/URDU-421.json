{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4439"}, "description": "In Intermediate Urdu, the curriculum focuses on the development of reading, listening and speaking skills. Although there are short assignments for writing in Urdu, the emphasis on developing writing as a skill is not part of the course objectives. Authentic texts in the three skills include conversations, short stories, current events, articles, films and plays. There is a continuous emphasis on vocabulary development and students are expected to add about five hundred new words to their active vocabulary per semester. The rules of grammar for structural accuracy and socialcultural propriety are parts of the regular curriculum. Class activities include students' short presentations, role-plays, singing and conversations. There are weekly assignments and quizzes, a mid-term and a final examination. The final evaluation will rest on class participation, performance in quizzes and tests, and completed assignments. This is a two-semester course. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "INTERMEDIATE URDU", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18178/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "3.17", "rTAQuality": "1.50", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.33", "rInstructorAttitude": "3.17", "rHomeworkValuable": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rInstructorConcern": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rClassPace": "2.50", "rExamsConsistent": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rGradeFairness": "2.33", "rArticulateGoals": "2.67", "rOralSkills": "3.00", "rNativeAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "3.17", "rInstructorEffective": "2.67", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE URDU", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "URDU-421-001", "path": "/courses/18178/sections/001", "id": "18178-001", "aliases": ["URDU-421-001", "NELC-421-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/18178/sections/001/reviews/1956-RUBAB-QURESHI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1956-RUBAB-QURESHI", "first_name": "RUBAB", "last_name": "QURESHI", "id": "1956-RUBAB-QURESHI", "name": "RUBAB QURESHI"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "18178-001-1956-RUBAB-QURESHI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URDU-421", "path": "/courses/18178", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18178/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE URDU", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "URDU-421-001", "path": "/courses/18178/sections/001", "id": "18178-001", "aliases": ["URDU-421-001", "NELC-421-001"]}]}, "id": 18178, "aliases": ["URDU-421", "NELC-421"]}
