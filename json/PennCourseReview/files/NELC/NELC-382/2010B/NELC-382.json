{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4872"}, "description": "Surveys in some detail the images of Islam in the West, as well as pre-modern Muslim perceptions of Europe and the changing character of these perceptions in modern times, now including the larger western world. Particular attention is paid to the medieval period--extending from the rise of Islam in the seventh century to the Muslim conquest of Constantinople and the end of Muslim rule in Spain in the fifteenth. Lying at the core of the course is a deep historical irony: the massive process of the transmission of knowledge and of intellectual and cultural attitudes from the Greek world into Islam and from Islam into the Latin West on the one hand, and the phenomenon of \"Orientalism\" on the other, the latter embodying a doctrine of an essential Islam-West dichotomy. Readings include Dante's Divine Comedy, selections from the Arabian Nights, as well as modern Iranian polemics against the western world. \n\n", "semester": "2010B", "name": "ISLAM & THE WEST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21102/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.33", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM & THE WEST", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "NELC-382-910", "path": "/courses/21102/sections/910", "id": "21102-910", "aliases": ["NELC-382-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/21102/sections/910/reviews/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/74-S--NOMANUL-HAQ", "first_name": "S.
