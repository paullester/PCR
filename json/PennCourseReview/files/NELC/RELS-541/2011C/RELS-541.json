{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4843"}, "description": "This seminar explores the place of visual religious arts in Islam; we will attempt to get beyond conventional ideas regarding the im/propriety of visual representation to examine how Muslims have understood and deployed visual art in a number of historical and cultural contexts. In the process, we will explore the ways in which visuality as a process renders the act of seeing into a religious experieence. As such, we will also examine the role of the arts in relation to religion: how does vision affect the understanding and practice of religion,, and what do visual arts tell us about religion in ways that texts of speech cannot? Simultaneously, what does the study of religion tell us about visual art that art history cannot? \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "ISLAM & RELIGIOUS IMAGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25068/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.75", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "ISLAM & RELIGIOUS IMAGE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RELS-541-401", "path": "/courses/25068/sections/401", "id": "25068-401", "aliases": ["RELS-541-401", "SAST-541-401", "NELC-581-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/25068/sections/401/reviews/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "first_name": "JAMAL J.", "last_name": "ELIAS", "id": "3483-JAMAL-J--ELIAS", "name": "JAMAL J.
