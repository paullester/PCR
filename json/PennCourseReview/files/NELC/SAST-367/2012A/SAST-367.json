{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5043"}, "description": "'Barbarian hordes'? Cities and saints? Aristocrats and horse nomads? Traders and scholars? Colonial powers and the curtailing of mobility? Global empires and local nationalisms? Iron curtains and Cold Warriors? Transnational militancy, globalized warfare, and vast mineral wealth? In many ways, Central and South Asia taken together form a microcosm of world history: the meeting of overland and oceanic histories; the meeting of agrarian and nomadic empires; the point where east and west met in the cold war. Our questions for this course are: how have Central Asia and South Asia been interlinked - and sometimes delinked - since the rise of Islam until now? And what can this shifting relationship tell us about topics in world history more broadly? The course is both an introduction to the long-term history of Central and South Asia, and an introduction to ways of thinking about themes in world history. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SILK RD TO SO ASIA: The Silk Road to South Asia", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28132/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SILK RD TO SO ASIA: The Silk Road to South Asia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-367-401", "path": "/courses/28132/sections/401", "id": "28132-401", "aliases": ["SAST-367-401", "NELC-387-401", "SAST-667-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/28132/sections/401/reviews/4974-JAMES-CARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4974-JAMES-CARON", "first_name": "JAMES", "last_name": "CARON", "id": "4974-JAMES-CARON", "name": "JAMES CARON"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "28132-401-4974-JAMES-CARON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-367", "path": "/courses/28132", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28132/sections", "values": [{"name": "SILK RD TO SO ASIA: The Silk Road to South Asia", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-367-401", "path": "/courses/28132/sections/401", "id": "28132-401", "aliases": ["SAST-367-401", "NELC-387-401", "SAST-667-401"]}]}, "id": 28132, "aliases": ["SAST-367", "NELC-387", "SAST-667"]}
