{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/177"}, "description": "Topics: how to read star-maps and find objects in the night sky, learning about astronomical phenomena as we observe them, telescope training, planets, and stars, the nature of light, and signal processing. Two one-hour daytime lectures each week plus three-hour evening lab in smaller groups. Attendance at one lab session per week is required by each student - multiple times are scheduled due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions for observing. Requires substantial out-of-class time dedication and commitment to sharing work in small groups. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/177/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.20", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.65", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.84", "rReadingsValue": "2.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-150-001", "path": "/courses/177/sections/001", "id": "177-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/177/sections/001/reviews/153-DEBORAH-L--GOLDADER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/153-DEBORAH-L--GOLDADER", "first_name": "DEBORAH L.", "last_name": "GOLDADER", "id": "153-DEBORAH-L--GOLDADER", "name": "DEBORAH L.
