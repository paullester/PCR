{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2236"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11457/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-525-001", "path": "/courses/11457/sections/001", "id": "11457-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-525-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/11457/sections/001/reviews/152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "first_name": "BHUVNESH", "last_name": "JAIN", "id": "152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "name": "BHUVNESH JAIN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "11457-001-152-BHUVNESH-JAIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASTR-525", "path": "/courses/11457", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11457/sections", "values": [{"name": "FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-525-001", "path": "/courses/11457/sections/001", "id": "11457-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-525-001"]}]}, "id": 11457, "aliases": ["ASTR-525"]}
