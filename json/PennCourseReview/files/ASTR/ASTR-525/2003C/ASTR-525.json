{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2236"}, "description": "This is a graduate level, introductory course in general relativity and modern cosmology. The basics of general relativity will be covered with a view to understanding cosmology and carrying out calculations relevant to the expanding universe and perturbations in it. Some of the key topics in modern cosmology will be covered -- these include the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, gravitational lensing and dark energy. The current cosmological model and open questions driving research will be discussed briefly in connection with these topics. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3811/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.77", "rDifficulty": "2.62", "rStimulateInterest": "2.62", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "2.77", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-525-001", "path": "/courses/3811/sections/001", "id": "3811-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-525-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/3811/sections/001/reviews/152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "first_name": "BHUVNESH", "last_name": "JAIN", "id": "152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "name": "BHUVNESH JAIN"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "3811-001-152-BHUVNESH-JAIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASTR-525", "path": "/courses/3811", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3811/sections", "values": [{"name": "FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-525-001", "path": "/courses/3811/sections/001", "id": "3811-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-525-001"]}]}, "id": 3811, "aliases": ["ASTR-525"]}
