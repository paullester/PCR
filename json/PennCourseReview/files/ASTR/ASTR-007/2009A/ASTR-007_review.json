Topics include the solar system, stars, black holes, galaxies, and the structure, origin and future of the Universe itself. This course fulfills both the Quantitative Data Analysis requirement and the Natural Sciences and Mathematics sector requirement.\r\n\r\nStudents described the course as \u201cvery informative.\u201d Several students felt that the topics covered were \u201cbroad,\u201d but acknowledged that such extensive exploration was fitting for a big-picture introductory course. Students particularly enjoyed in-class discussions, which were often focused on controversial topics.\r\n\r\nStudents commented that Professor Balasubramanian\u2019s lectures were \u201calways filled with passion\u201d and described Balasubramian as a \u201cstar professor\u201d who \u201ccommunicates the material in a unique way.\u201d Students were also pleased with his accessibility; as one student noted, Balasubramian was \u201calways willing to help.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, students had positive experiences when taking this class, though there were some complaints about the workload. Some students felt there should only have been one essay for the midterm, though it was \u201cbetter than studying for a test.\u201d Others suggested a recitation component be added to the class to provide additional time for asking questions.", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/15369/sections/301/reviews/972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN", "first_name": "VIJAY", "last_name": "BALASUBRAMANIAN", "id": "972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN", "name": "VIJAY BALASUBRAMANIAN"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "15369-301-972-VIJAY-BALASUBRAMANIAN"}]
