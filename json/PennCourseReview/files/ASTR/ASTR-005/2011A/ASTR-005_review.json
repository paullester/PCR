Subjects that will be covered include the Sun, supernovae, black holes, the Milky Way, dark matter and energy, and the Big Bang. Discussions center on understanding the properties of astronomical bodies using physical theories such as Relativity. The course can be taken to fulfill the Physical World Sector requirement.\r\n\r\nOverall students seemed to enjoy the class quite a lot. Students felt like they learned a great deal, especially in terms of the \u201cscientific method\u201d as well as general \u201castronomy and physics\u201d concepts. Some described concepts as \u201cfar reaching,\u201d and most finished with a more \u201cinformed outlook\u201d on the universe.\r\n\r\nAcross the board, students acclaimed Professor Bernstein\u2019s teaching style. Many appreciated his \u201chumor\u201d and \u201cclear, engaging\u201d communication abilities and how \u201centhusiastic\u201d and accessible he was. There were several students who were pleasantly surprised as the class exceeded their expectations. One senior, attempting to fulfill a sector requirement, described it as \u201cone of [his] three favorite classes [he\u2019s] ever taken at UPenn.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost students who took this class were College upperclassmen fulfilling their Physical World Sector requirement. Many described the homework as extremely difficult and time-consuming. Some explained that attending office hours was the only way they could complete assignments. Midterms were also difficult with most of the class scoring in the 60-70% range. The course was recommended to both majors and non-majors.\r\n", "num_students": 62, "path": "/courses/21308/sections/001/reviews/2060-GARY-M--BERNSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2060-GARY-M--BERNSTEIN", "first_name": "GARY M.", "last_name": "BERNSTEIN", "id": "2060-GARY-M--BERNSTEIN", "name": "GARY M.
