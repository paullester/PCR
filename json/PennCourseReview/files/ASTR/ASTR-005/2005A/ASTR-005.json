{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2744"}, "description": "A survey course on understanding stars, galaxies, and the history of the Universe. Subjects include the Sun, supernovae, black holes, the Milky Way, dark matter and dark energy, and the Big Bang. All discussions will emphasize how our knowledge of distant, exotic objects is based on physical theories such as Relativity, and tested with observations and discoveries that continue to the present day. Elementary algebra and geometry will be used. Physical-science majors and engineers should prefer ASTR 012 to this course. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "GALAXIES & UNIVERSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10081/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.53", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "GALAXIES & UNIVERSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-005-001", "path": "/courses/10081/sections/001", "id": "10081-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-005-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/10081/sections/001/reviews/2060-GARY-M--BERNSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2060-GARY-M--BERNSTEIN", "first_name": "GARY M.", "last_name": "BERNSTEIN", "id": "2060-GARY-M--BERNSTEIN", "name": "GARY M.
