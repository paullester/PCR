Professor Sako was able to relate difficult concepts in a \u201clucid manner,\u201d and he never hesitated to answer questions or help students.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were described as \u201cfair,\u201d and the readings as helpful. However, several students complained about the textbook, which was \u201cextremely difficult to digest\u201d and went over students\u2019 heads. One student felt that this class would be interesting and enjoyable to a non-physics major, provided he could keep up with the math.\r\n", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/21310/sections/001/reviews/3898-MASAO-SAKO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3898-MASAO-SAKO", "first_name": "MASAO", "last_name": "SAKO", "id": "3898-MASAO-SAKO", "name": "MASAO SAKO"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "21310-001-3898-MASAO-SAKO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ASTR-392", "path": "/courses/21310", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21310/sections", "values": [{"name": "LIFE AND DEATH OF STARS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-392-001", "path": "/courses/21310/sections/001", "id": "21310-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-392-001"]}]}, "id": 21310, "aliases": ["ASTR-392"]}
