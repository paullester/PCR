The majority of the reviews did mention that the course and its theories were difficult to grasp and could perhaps have used \u201cmore structure\u201d; however, it was also described as \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201ctoo basic.\u201d One student wrote that the class \u201clived up to and exceeded all my expectations.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Jain was highly regarded as \u201capproachable\u201d and \u201cexciting\u201d as well as praised for injecting comedy into his lectures. One student said he was \u201cgreat at lecturing,\u201d but another said it would have been nice if he offered \u201cpractice tests or questions before exams.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills the physical world sector. Its prerequisites are Math114 and Phys151, though they can be taken concurrently. The course is math heavy and is recommended for astronomy, engineering, or other physical science majors.\r\n", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/21309/sections/001/reviews/152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "first_name": "BHUVNESH", "last_name": "JAIN", "id": "152-BHUVNESH-JAIN", "name": "BHUVNESH JAIN"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "21309-001-152-BHUVNESH-JAIN"}]
