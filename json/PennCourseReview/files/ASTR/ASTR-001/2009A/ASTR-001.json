{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/173"}, "description": "A general survey, designed for the non-major, of the facts and theories of the astronomical universe, from solar system, to stars, to galaxies and cosmology. Topics include planets, satellites, small objects in the solar system, and extraterrestrial life; stars, their evolution, and their final state as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes; galaxies, quasars, large structures, background radiation, and big bang cosmology. Elementary algebra and geometry will be used. This course is not recommended for physical-science majors or engineering students. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "SURVEY OF THE UNIVERSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15368/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.59", "rDifficulty": "2.48", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "2.37", "rCourseQuality": "2.68", "rWorkRequired": "2.65", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.45", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.35"}, "section": {"name": "SURVEY OF THE UNIVERSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-001-001", "path": "/courses/15368/sections/001", "id": "15368-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-001-001"]}, "comments": "This course is a general overview of astronomical theories, designed for non-majors.
