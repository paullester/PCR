{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/174"}, "description": "An examination of the origin and evolution of life in the Universe. This class is intended for non-majors and has no specific required science or math preparation beyond high school levels. Course material includes aspects of biology, geology, astronomy, physics, and chemistry as well as the study of and search for life in our Solar System (Mars, Europa) and elsewhere in the Universe. The origin of life on Earth and the range of extreme conditions in which life on Earth exists today will also be studied. Students will be asked to synthesize course material from lectures, readings, laboratory exercises, and homeworks to form an understanding of origin of life on Earth and the prospects for life elsewhere. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7359/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.56", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.94", "rRecommendMajor": "2.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ASTR-006-001", "path": "/courses/7359/sections/001", "id": "7359-001", "aliases": ["ASTR-006-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/7359/sections/001/reviews/2868-RAVI-K--SHETH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2868-RAVI-K--SHETH", "first_name": "RAVI K.", "last_name": "SHETH", "id": "2868-RAVI-K--SHETH", "name": "RAVI K.
