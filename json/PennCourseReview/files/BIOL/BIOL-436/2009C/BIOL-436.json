{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2484"}, "description": "This course is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in molecular physiology of sensory signal transduction. The major topics to cover will be signal transduction mechanisms used by membrane ion channels and receptors that detect the sensory stimuli (light, sound, temperature and taste, for example) and transmit the signals to the nervous system. Modern molecular/structural techniques (patch clamp, protein crystallization, molecular genetics, expression cloning and protein purification) will be introduced along with each topic. References will be primary research articles. Students will critically evaluate research discoveries by reading and presenting one to two original research papers. Each student is required to write a 10-page research proposal and to critique proposals written by fellow students. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17041/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.56", "rStimulateInterest": "2.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.11", "rWorkRequired": "2.39", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-436-301", "path": "/courses/17041/sections/301", "id": "17041-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-436-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/17041/sections/301/reviews/2068-DEJIAN-REN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2068-DEJIAN-REN", "first_name": "DEJIAN", "last_name": "REN", "id": "2068-DEJIAN-REN", "name": "DEJIAN REN"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "17041-301-2068-DEJIAN-REN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-436", "path": "/courses/17041", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17041/sections", "values": [{"name": "MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-436-301", "path": "/courses/17041/sections/301", "id": "17041-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-436-301"]}]}, "id": 17041, "aliases": ["BIOL-436"]}
