{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4170"}, "description": "The evolution of multicellularity required that cells be able to both send and receive signals from their neighbors. The development of organs and differentiation of cells and tissues requires reliable and continuous communication between cells. Consequences of inappropriate or anomalous signaling include development abnormalities and cancer. This class will examine mechanisms of cell-to-cell signaling between bacterial, plant, and animal cells with an emphasis on the cell biology of development. Particular attention will be given to the mechanims by which biomolecules are able to traffic from cell to cell and cross membranes and the role of the cytoskeleton in signaling. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "COMM AT CELLULAR LEVEL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19859/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.20", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "COMM AT CELLULAR LEVEL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-482-301", "path": "/courses/19859/sections/301", "id": "19859-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-482-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/19859/sections/301/reviews/4147-KIMBERLY-L--GALLAGHER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4147-KIMBERLY-L--GALLAGHER", "first_name": "KIMBERLY L.", "last_name": "GALLAGHER", "id": "4147-KIMBERLY-L--GALLAGHER", "name": "KIMBERLY L.
