{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5185"}, "description": "Biotechnology transforms basic biological research into pharmaceutical therapies. This course will examine some explanations for American biotechnology vitality by studying case histories in which fundamental, biological observations were subsequently developed, successfully and unsuccessfully, for therapeutic applications. Along the way, we will also seek to understand the interactions among academic research institutions, biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies, the Food and Drug Administration, financial institutions, venture groups, and the Patent and Trademark Office. Classes will be highly interactive. Students will present case histories in a critical fashion. Ultimately, students will conduct mock negotiations focused on university technology transfers, clinical trial design, financing, and intellectual property. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SCIENCE & ART OF BIOTECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28636/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "1.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.40", "rCommAbility": "3.21", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30"}, "section": {"name": "SCIENCE & ART OF BIOTECH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-477-301", "path": "/courses/28636/sections/301", "id": "28636-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-477-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/28636/sections/301/reviews/5714-STEPHEN-A-ROTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5714-STEPHEN-A-ROTH", "first_name": "STEPHEN A", "last_name": "ROTH", "id": "5714-STEPHEN-A-ROTH", "name": "STEPHEN A ROTH"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "28636-301-5714-STEPHEN-A-ROTH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-477", "path": "/courses/28636", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28636/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCIENCE & ART OF BIOTECH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-477-301", "path": "/courses/28636/sections/301", "id": "28636-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-477-301"]}]}, "id": 28636, "aliases": ["BIOL-477"]}
