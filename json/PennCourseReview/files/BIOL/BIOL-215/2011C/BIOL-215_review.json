Students found that in this course physiology came alive with all the\r\napplications encountered in the course. Many students mainly relied on the textbook or\r\noutside research to learn the material in this course. Students warn that the course is very\r\nmath based. In addition, they found the course to be disorganized.\r\nStudents thought professor Rome was funny. They describe him as friendly and\r\napproachable. However, found his handouts to be very confusing and unhelpful. In\r\naddition, his use of transparencies was found to be extremely unhelpful in\r\ncommunicating the course material.\r\nThe prerequisites for this course include BIOL 102 or 121 of 124. This class is\r\nrecommended for students interested in medicine because the material of the course is\r\nvery relevant. Students said the course is very difficult. They found that exams did not\r\nassess a student\u2019s knowledge of the class material, but rather were experimental set-ups\r\nthat students were required to analyze. In addition, the grading for this course is very\r\ndifficult, and usually very little partial credit is awarded.
