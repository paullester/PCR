Students recommended the course to \"all biology majors\" and anyone else, especially pre-meds, interested in physiology and/or medicine. Students reported spending varying amounts of time for this class, but many students found the amount of work to be disproportionate with the designation of only 0.5 cu. The lab practical at the end of the year is based largely on memorization as opposed to application.\r\n", "num_students": 147, "path": "/courses/25692/sections/001/reviews/1290-LINDA-J--ROBINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1290-LINDA-J--ROBINSON", "first_name": "LINDA J.", "last_name": "ROBINSON", "id": "1290-LINDA-J--ROBINSON", "name": "LINDA J.
