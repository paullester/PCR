Organism Biology Lab is an intensive introductory laboratory in organism biology. \r\n\r\nStudents found the course \u201cinteresting,\u201d though they complained that it was overloaded with tiny, often irrelevant details. It was considered a decent introductory class for biology, but \u201cnot a substitute for BIOL102\u201d. The hands on labs were overall the part of the class that students enjoyed the most.\r\n\r\nProfessor Robinson was considered \u201capproachable\u201d and very knowledgeable. However, one student did comment that despite her expertise, she appeared to be a weak public speaker.\r\n\r\nBiol 124 requires solid high school biology or credit by exam for Biol 102. Biol 124 is the companion course to Biol 121 and may be taken before or after Biol 121. Students may not take both Biol 102 and 124 for credits. The workload was described as heavy especially given the amount of credit for the course. Many students complained about the surprise quizzes that required a tremendous amount of \u201crote memorization.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 135, "path": "/courses/21347/sections/001/reviews/1290-LINDA-J--ROBINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1290-LINDA-J--ROBINSON", "first_name": "LINDA J.", "last_name": "ROBINSON", "id": "1290-LINDA-J--ROBINSON", "name": "LINDA J.
