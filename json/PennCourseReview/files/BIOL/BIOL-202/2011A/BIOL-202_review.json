It enforces critical thinking skills. Many students enjoyed the in-class problems.\r\n\r\nStudents found that the videos and in-class problems Professor Witmer used made the class less static, and a nice break from lecture. Professor Witmer was described as a great lecturer but had trouble understanding and responding to questions that were asked. Dr. Witmer really cares about her students understanding of the material and is willing to offer outside help. At times, she struggles to garner interest, but is very clear as to what topics are important to know in the long term.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites for this course include BIOL 101 and 102, or BIOL 121. In addition, a strong high school background in chemistry or CHEM 102 is recommended. Students found that the questions on the exams were difficult to understand. The questions were posed in a confusing and convoluted manner and more effort was placed on understanding what the questions were asking rather than answering them.\r\n", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/21348/sections/601/reviews/2880-XIAOHONG-ZOU-WITMER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2880-XIAOHONG-ZOU-WITMER", "first_name": "XIAOHONG ZOU", "last_name": "WITMER", "id": "2880-XIAOHONG-ZOU-WITMER", "name": "XIAOHONG ZOU WITMER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "21348-601-2880-XIAOHONG-ZOU-WITMER"}]
