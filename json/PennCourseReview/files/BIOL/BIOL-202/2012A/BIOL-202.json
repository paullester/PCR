Many students commented how some of the material was similar to BIOL121, except much more specific and complicated. Several students described the class as \u201cvery interesting\u201d and \u201cessential for anyone studying biology.\u201d  Many students also noted, however, that the class required \u201ca lot of memorization.\u201d  Additionally, students found it frustrating and disorganized how the two professors \u201cwould alternate their lectures randomly,\u201d as they had very different teaching styles.  Overall, students felt the course was \u201cnecessary, but not fun.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tProfessor Svitkina was praised for being \u201cknowledgeable, concise, organized and clear.\u201d  At the same time, however, students felt her lectures were \u201cjam-packed with info,\u201d which made it very difficult to study for her exams.  She explained the \u201cimportant details,\u201d though, which made attending her lectures worthwhile.  Overall, students felt that Professor Svitkina demanded a lot from her students\u2014sometimes an overwhelming amount of material\u2014but was a \u201cdirect\u201d enough professor that she made it possible.\r\n\r\n\tStudents mostly found this class to be \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d  It was fairly strongly recommended for majors, but not at all recommended for non-biology majors.  BIOL 101 and 102 or BIOL 121 are prerequisites for this course.  CHEM 102 or a strong high school background in chemistry is highly recommended before taking this course.", "num_students": 194, "path": "/courses/27047/sections/001/reviews/2416-TATYANA-M--SVITKINA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2416-TATYANA-M--SVITKINA", "first_name": "TATYANA M.", "last_name": "SVITKINA", "id": "2416-TATYANA-M--SVITKINA", "name": "TATYANA M.
