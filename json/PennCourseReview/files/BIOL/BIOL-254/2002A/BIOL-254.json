{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/217"}, "description": "A view of how a multicellular embryo is specified to differentiate into a wide spectrum of cell types, and how the spatial patterns and axes of embryos are determined. The course will focus on genetic and molecular approaches, but will also discuss comparative embryology and inductive events not yet understood on a molecular level. Recent work on cloning animals using nuclear transfer and on stem cell biology will also be covered. Special emphasis will be placed on two organisms offering particular experimental advantages for the study of embryonic development: Drosophila, C. elegans, zebrafish, chicks, frogs, and mice. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/217/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.30", "rDifficulty": "3.35", "rStimulateInterest": "2.87", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.97", "rWorkRequired": "3.55", "rInstructorAccess": "3.31", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.03", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-254-001", "path": "/courses/217/sections/001", "id": "217-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-254-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/217/sections/001/reviews/195-JUDITH-A--CEBRA-THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/195-JUDITH-A--CEBRA-THOMAS", "first_name": "JUDITH A.", "last_name": "CEBRA-THOMAS", "id": "195-JUDITH-A--CEBRA-THOMAS", "name": "JUDITH A.
