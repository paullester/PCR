This lecture course focuses on the use of mutations to study gene function and higher order biological processes, methods for reporting and manipulating gene expression, and analysis of the genetic basis of natural variation.\r\n\r\nThe course allowed \u201cstudents to learn a lot about genetic analysis,\u201d as well as \u201chow to read and analyze journal articles.\u201d Some students found the material to be repetitive of earlier genetics courses.\r\n\r\nStudents heaped praise upon Professor Poethig, citing his \u201cpassion for the material\u201d and his \u201cskillful lecturing.\u201d Several students called Professor Poethig one of \u201cthe best lecturers at Penn.\u201d Class time was \u201corganized\u201d and \u201crelaxing and fun\u201d to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nStudents felt the readings were informative, but one student felt that after the mid-term there was \u201cno accountability with regards to the readings assigned.\u201d Students enjoyed the final paper, calling it \u201cinstructive\u201d and helpful with learning the material.
