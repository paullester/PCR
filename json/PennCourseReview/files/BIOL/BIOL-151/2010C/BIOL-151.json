{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5081"}, "description": "This course will cover fundamental concepts in Regeneration Biology at an introductory level. Lectures will be given by leaders in stem cell biology and embryology and by a leader in K-12 science education. Along with the opportunity to learn aspects of this exciting area of biology, a major goal of the course is to provide an experience in teaching students at West Philadelphia High School. Students will spend one afternoon per week leading hands-on inquiry-based activities at the high school. Course does not count toward the Biology major or minor. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "LEARN & TEACH REGEN BIO: Learning and Teaching Regeneration Biology", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22718/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "1.70", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.90", "rInstructorAccess": "2.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "2.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "LEARN & TEACH REGEN BIO: Learning and Teaching Regeneration Biology", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-151-001", "path": "/courses/22718/sections/001", "id": "22718-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-151-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/22718/sections/001/reviews/5591-DANIEL-S-KESSLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5591-DANIEL-S-KESSLER", "first_name": "DANIEL S", "last_name": "KESSLER", "id": "5591-DANIEL-S-KESSLER", "name": "DANIEL S KESSLER"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "22718-001-5591-DANIEL-S-KESSLER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "1.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.70", "rRecommendMajor": "3.90", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "1.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.56", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "LEARN & TEACH REGEN BIO: Learning and Teaching Regeneration Biology", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-151-001", "path": "/courses/22718/sections/001", "id": "22718-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-151-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/22718/sections/001/reviews/5592-JAMIE-R--SHUDA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5592-JAMIE-R--SHUDA", "first_name": "JAMIE R.", "last_name": "SHUDA", "id": "5592-JAMIE-R--SHUDA", "name": "JAMIE R.
