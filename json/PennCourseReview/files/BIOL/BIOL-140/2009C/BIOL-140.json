Lectures were recorded and based on photographic essays mounted onto Power Point presentations, often containing over 50 images with accompanying text. Several classes are taught by guest lecturers. The textbook used is The Diversity of Life, by Wilson (1999). The course fulfills the natural science and mathematics sector requirement, and is not recommended for freshman or students without some background in biology.\r\n\r\nStudents found this course \u201cfascinating,\u201d and one student said it was \u201cthe most interesting class I have taken in my 3.5 years at Penn.\u201d Many also felt it was very informative and opened students to new ways of thinking about how humans interact with the environment.\r\n\r\nStudents said Professor Janzen is an \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cinspiring,\u2019 \u201cincredibly knowledgeable\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d lecturer who can make \u201cthe most mundane topics come alive.\u201d Many students claimed that Professor Janzen was one of the best professors they\u2019ve had at Penn and that this class was one of the most interesting courses they\u2019ve ever taken.\r\n\r\nMost students said that the course gives a good overview of basic biological concepts so that even those less familiar with biology can do well. A couple of students mentioned that the class doesn\u2019t require very much work. Although most learning comes straight from lecture, some students said the readings can be tedious at times. There are 2 non-cumulative midterms and one cumulative final, all multiple choice and graded on a curve. Several students voiced concern about the questions asked on exams, which focused on \u201cunimportant minutiae instead of the big issues\u201d as one student put it. Such exams, written by TAs, required \u201cnit-picky and extreme study of the details of all the assigned articles, books and lectures,\u201d complained one student. However, most students said the quality of the course and professor was worth it.", "num_students": 76, "path": "/courses/17025/sections/401/reviews/1287-DANIEL-H-JANZEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1287-DANIEL-H-JANZEN", "first_name": "DANIEL H", "last_name": "JANZEN", "id": "1287-DANIEL-H-JANZEN", "name": "DANIEL H JANZEN"}, "num_reviewers": 72, "id": "17025-401-1287-DANIEL-H-JANZEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-140", "path": "/courses/17025", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17025/sections", "values": [{"name": "HUMANS & THE ENVIRONMENT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-140-401", "path": "/courses/17025/sections/401", "id": "17025-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-140-401", "BIOL-440-401"]}]}, "id": 17025, "aliases": ["BIOL-140", "BIOL-440"]}
