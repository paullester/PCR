Lectures are recorded and based on photographic essays mounted\r\nonto Power Point presentations, often containing over 50 images with accompanying text.\r\nSeveral classes are taught by guest lecturers. The textbook used is The Diversity of Life,\r\nby Wilson (1999). The course fulfills the Natural Science and Mathematics sector\r\nrequirement and is not recommended for freshman or students without some background\r\nin biology.\r\nMany students referred to this course as \u201cthe best class\u201d they have ever taken,\r\nreporting \u201cthe material was really interesting, even for people who don\u2019t have much\r\ninterest in biology.\u201d There was a lot of material to be learned, however.\r\nNearly every student gave Professor Janzen fantastic reviews, describing him as\r\n\u201can icon in science\u2026 an inspiration to anyone interested in biology.\u201d He was noted for\r\nhis \u201cextensive life experiences\u201d in the subject and the fact that he \u201cdiscovered a lot\u201d of\r\nwhat was studied in class. Students reported Professor Janzen had the ability to make\r\n\u201cecology extremely interesting and accessible.\u201d\r\nBoth science and non-science majors really enjoyed this class and found it\r\nmanageable. The course does require \u201ca lot of reading,\u201d but not much work outside of\r\nthat.
