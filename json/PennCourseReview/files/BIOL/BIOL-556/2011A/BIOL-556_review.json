The course covers advanced statistical methods, including multivariate techniques (in particular discriminant functions, principal components, multiple correlation, and regression) and the design and analysis of experiments.\r\n\r\nStudents found this course to be very interesting and \u201cpractical.\u201d They felt they learned about a range of \u201cuseful and valuable\u201d topics. Several students commented on how what they learned will be useful for future research. The course is, however, at a \u201chigh difficulty level\u201d and is very fast paced. Students recommended taking a beginner\u2019s course before this one.\r\n\r\nProfessor Petraitis was described as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cvery smart.\u201d Students remarked that he was excellent at explaining complicated concepts and going into the history and background of them. One student even said that Professor Petraitis made him realize that \u201cstatistics is an art.\u201d However, students were concerned that the class moves too quickly, and felt that Professor Petraitis needed to write more on the board and use more explicit examples, as lectures were often \u201cunclear.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne student was concerned that the homework and exam questions were worded vaguely, and felt that the grading was \u201csubjective.\u201d The recitations were described as very helpful for students since it is easy to get lost in the fast-paced lectures.\r\n", "num_students": 34, "path": "/courses/21370/sections/001/reviews/197-PETER-S-PETRAITIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/197-PETER-S-PETRAITIS", "first_name": "PETER S", "last_name": "PETRAITIS", "id": "197-PETER-S-PETRAITIS", "name": "PETER S PETRAITIS"}, "num_reviewers": 30, "id": "21370-001-197-PETER-S-PETRAITIS"}]
