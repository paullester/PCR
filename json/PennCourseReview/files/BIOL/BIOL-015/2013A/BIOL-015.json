{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4896"}, "description": "Understanding how diseases disrupt the life of human individuals requires an appreciation of the genetic, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that underlie normal human biology. After providing some of this basic information, in a form accessible to students in the humanities, social sciences and physical sciences, this course will focus on a selective group of human diseases, including inherited metabolic and neurological disorders, cancer, and viral infections. Presentations by experts in these areas will be followed by sessions discussing various aspects of each disease, including the biological basis of therapies and preventive methods including gene therapy, stem cells, and vaccines. This course is designed for non-majors and is open to both freshmen and upperclassmen. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "BIOLOGY OF HUMAN DISEASE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29952/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.61", "rTAQuality": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorQuality": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "2.74", "rInstructorAccess": "2.96"}, "section": {"name": "BIOLOGY OF HUMAN DISEASE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-015-001", "path": "/courses/29952/sections/001", "id": "29952-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-015-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/29952/sections/001/reviews/1297-ERIC-S--WEINBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1297-ERIC-S--WEINBERG", "first_name": "ERIC S.", "last_name": "WEINBERG", "id": "1297-ERIC-S--WEINBERG", "name": "ERIC S.
