{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/222"}, "description": "This course examines the relationships of human health and disease to psychosocial, nutritional, and other behavioral and environmental factors. We will evaluate the strengths and weakness of the evidence concerning proposed relationships between environmental factors, behavior and health. Also, we will study the physiological mechanisms responsible for these relationships. Based on lectures, class discussion, student reports, and readings in a physiology text, review articles and original research articles. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "PSYCHOSOC,NUTRIT,HEALTH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14176/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.30", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "3.35", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.20", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "PSYCHOSOC,NUTRIT,HEALTH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-409-301", "path": "/courses/14176/sections/301", "id": "14176-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-409-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/14176/sections/301/reviews/203-INGRID-L-WALDRON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/203-INGRID-L-WALDRON", "first_name": "INGRID L", "last_name": "WALDRON", "id": "203-INGRID-L-WALDRON", "name": "INGRID L WALDRON"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "14176-301-203-INGRID-L-WALDRON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-409", "path": "/courses/14176", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14176/sections", "values": [{"name": "PSYCHOSOC,NUTRIT,HEALTH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-409-301", "path": "/courses/14176/sections/301", "id": "14176-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-409-301"]}]}, "id": 14176, "aliases": ["BIOL-409"]}
