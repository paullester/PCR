It \u201cdoes require quite a bit of studying\u201d and \u201cwas still a lot of work,\u201d but was generally considered easier than expected. One student called the class \u201ca very difficult course,\u201d while another noted the \u201chard grade curve\u201d due to the face that \u201cmost kids in the class are bio engineers or advanced biology students.\u201d This review was based on eight student comments.", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/27045/sections/001/reviews/1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "first_name": "PHILIP ARTHUR", "last_name": "REA", "id": "1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "name": "PHILIP ARTHUR REA"}, "num_reviewers": 49, "id": "27045-001-1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "3.26", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "2.51", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.47", "rInstructorQuality": "2.42"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO BIO-MOLEC BIO LIFE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-121-001", "path": "/courses/27045/sections/001", "id": "27045-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-121-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/27045/sections/001/reviews/3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON", "first_name": "DUSTIN", "last_name": "BRISSON", "id": "3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON", "name": "DUSTIN BRISSON"}, "num_reviewers": 49, "id": "27045-001-3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.15", "rDifficulty": "3.26", "rStimulateInterest": "2.28", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.95", "rWorkRequired": "2.78", "rInstructorAccess": "2.54", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "2.37"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO BIO-MOLEC BIO LIFE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-121-001", "path": "/courses/27045/sections/001", "id": "27045-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-121-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 52, "path": "/courses/27045/sections/001/reviews/3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "LAMPSON", "id": "3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "name": "MICHAEL A.
