Recitation was held with the entire class, but several\r\nstudents found this to be \u201cineffective.\u201d Students were also not very complimentary of the\r\ntextbook/readings and found lectures to be more useful for exams.\r\nStudents generally liked Professor Goulian, describing him as \u201cvery good,\u201d\r\n\u201cclear,\u201d and noting that his lectures \u201cfollowed nicely with the textbook.\u201d\r\nThis course fulfills the Living World Sector.
