{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1703"}, "description": "An intensive introductory lecture course covering the cell, molecular biology, biochemistry, and the genetics of animals, bacteria, and viruses. This course is comparable to Biology 101, but places greater emphasis on molecular mechanisms and experimental approaches. Particular attention is given to the ways in which modern cell biological and molecular genetic methods contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes, the mechanistic basis of human disease, and recent biotechnological innovations. BIOL 121 and 123 must be taken concurrently. \n\nBiology Majors and Pre-Medical students should take either BIOL 101 or 121. BIOL 121 is the companion course to BIOL 124 and may be taken before or after BIOL 124. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTRO BIO-MOLEC BIO LIFE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12941/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "3.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.02", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.12", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.99", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO BIO-MOLEC BIO LIFE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-121-001", "path": "/courses/12941/sections/001", "id": "12941-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-121-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 257, "path": "/courses/12941/sections/001/reviews/1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "first_name": "PHILIP ARTHUR", "last_name": "REA", "id": "1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "name": "PHILIP ARTHUR REA"}, "num_reviewers": 169, "id": "12941-001-1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "3.37", "rStimulateInterest": "2.38", "rRecommendMajor": "3.44", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "2.63", "rReadingsValue": "2.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.63", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO BIO-MOLEC BIO LIFE", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-121-001", "path": "/courses/12941/sections/001", "id": "12941-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-121-001"]}, "comments": "Reviews on this class were mixed.

However, students expressed a great deal of frustration with the tests in the class.  No one was sure what material to study, and the Professor did not clarify their questions.  Often, student studied material, at the professor\u2019s urging, that would not appear on the tests.  Also, the Powerpoint presentations did not have enough information to be effective tools for the students to use in lectures and for tests.", "num_students": 257, "path": "/courses/12941/sections/001/reviews/3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "LAMPSON", "id": "3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "name": "MICHAEL A.
