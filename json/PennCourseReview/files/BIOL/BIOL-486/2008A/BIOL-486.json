{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4171"}, "description": "Life depends on the propagation of genetic material from one generation to the next through cycles of genome replication and cell division. The genome is copied by the parent, and one exact copy is inherited by each daughter cell. We will treat chromosomes as discrete entities, rather than collections of genes, that are replicated and divided with high fidelity to ensure that the genome remains stable over many generations. By reading selected primary literature covering several decades, we will build an understanding of the cell cycle by focusing on chromosomes and the associated molecular machinery. We will explore mechanisms that underlie replication and division, particularly control mechanisms that maintain genome integrity and are critical to prevent disease. The goal of the course is to develop a picture of the cell cycle by examining some of the key experiments and insights that have led to our current understanding. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "CELL DIV MITOTIC SPINDLE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19861/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.80", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.20", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "CELL DIV MITOTIC SPINDLE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-486-401", "path": "/courses/19861/sections/401", "id": "19861-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-486-401", "CAMB-486-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/19861/sections/401/reviews/3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "first_name": "MICHAEL A.", "last_name": "LAMPSON", "id": "3905-MICHAEL-A--LAMPSON", "name": "MICHAEL A.
