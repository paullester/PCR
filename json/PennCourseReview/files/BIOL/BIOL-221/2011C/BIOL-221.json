First, it\r\ncovers the basics of molecular biology, which includes DNA replication, transcription,\r\ntranslation, and regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and\r\ngenomics. Second, the class introduces Mendelian and molecular genetics.\r\nThere appeared to be a diverse collection of sentiments in regards to the material\r\ncovered in the course. Some students were extremely dissatisfied with the material\r\ncovered and felt that content covered in class was very \u201csuperficial.\u201d Others were content\r\nwith the amount of material covered and even felt that there may have been too much.\r\nProfessor Guild received a full spectrum of reviews ranging from one student\r\nsaying he was \u201cone of the best professors\u201d he has ever had to another saying he is \u201cnot\r\nthe best teacher for the course.\u201d As many students as there were who felt that Professor\r\nGuild was a \u201cpassionate\u201d and enthusiastic lecturer, there were an equal number who\r\nthought classes were very boring. It is clear that his unique teaching style appeals to some\r\nbut not to others. Most, however, agreed that regardless of his teaching abilities,\r\nProfessor Guild made himself very available and helpful outside of class.\r\nStudents agreed that exams were very long and difficult to complete in the\r\nallotted 50 minutes. Students felt this was the major reason why the average score on\r\nexams was in the 50-60% range. The class was mostly composed of underclassmen,\r\nprimarily biological science majors. Overall, they felt the course was very challenging\r\nand required a lot of effort to do well.", "num_students": 116, "path": "/courses/24065/sections/401/reviews/1285-GREGORY-M-GUILD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1285-GREGORY-M-GUILD", "first_name": "GREGORY M", "last_name": "GUILD", "id": "1285-GREGORY-M-GUILD", "name": "GREGORY M GUILD"}, "num_reviewers": 102, "id": "24065-401-1285-GREGORY-M-GUILD"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.05", "rRecommendMajor": "2.70", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.45", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "1.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "2.15", "rInstructorQuality": "2.15"}, "section": {"name": "MOLEC.
