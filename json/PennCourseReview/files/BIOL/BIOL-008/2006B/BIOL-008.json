{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1702"}, "description": "The discovery of penicillin ushered in a new medical era - the antibiotic era - where patients no longer died from simple infections. We are now in a seemingly never-ending cycle of new antibiotics. However, the pipeline for antibiotics has slowed and we are rapidly entering the superbug era. We will use antibiotic resistance as a lens through which to understand public health decisions and their implications. At the end of the course, students should understand how public health decisions are made with the help of different stakeholders, which in this case include the government and healthcare system, the food industry and pharmaceutical companies, doctors and veterinarians, individuals and their communities. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "HUMAN REPROD & SEX DIFS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9658/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.17", "rStimulateInterest": "1.17", "rRecommendMajor": "1.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.00", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorAccess": "2.45", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "1.67", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "HUMAN REPROD & SEX DIFS", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "BIOL-008-920", "path": "/courses/9658/sections/920", "id": "9658-920", "aliases": ["BIOL-008-920", "WSTD-008-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/9658/sections/920/reviews/196-RUTH-SPORER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/196-RUTH-SPORER", "first_name": "RUTH", "last_name": "SPORER", "id": "196-RUTH-SPORER", "name": "RUTH SPORER"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "9658-920-196-RUTH-SPORER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-008", "path": "/courses/9658", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9658/sections", "values": [{"name": "HUMAN REPROD & SEX DIFS", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "BIOL-008-920", "path": "/courses/9658/sections/920", "id": "9658-920", "aliases": ["BIOL-008-920", "WSTD-008-920"]}]}, "id": 9658, "aliases": ["BIOL-008", "WSTD-008"]}
