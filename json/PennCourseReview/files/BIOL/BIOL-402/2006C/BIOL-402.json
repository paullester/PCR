{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/220"}, "description": "Basic principles of protein characterization, enzyme kinetics and mechanism, membrane structure and function, metabolism and biochemistry of energy, and signal transduction. A problem-solving approach will be employed and emphasis will be placed on the application of quantitative methods to biochemical problems. Each of the five major sections of the course will be concluded with group discussions specifically directed at the solution of numerical problems and the interpretation of experimental results. In order to maximize the opportunities for students to think critically, analytically and creatively, most of the material covered in the course will be tested using take-home examinations. Students will have the option of attending sessions in which the recent original literature will be discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8605/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "1.26", "rRecommendMajor": "1.91", "rCourseQuality": "1.61", "rWorkRequired": "2.74", "rInstructorAccess": "2.87", "rReadingsValue": "2.74", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.91", "rCommAbility": "1.09", "rInstructorQuality": "1.52"}, "section": {"name": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIOL-402-601", "path": "/courses/8605/sections/601", "id": "8605-601", "aliases": ["BIOL-402-601"]}, "comments": "Many students found this course difficult and found Professor Shetzline\u2019s lecturing often unprepared and hard to follow.
