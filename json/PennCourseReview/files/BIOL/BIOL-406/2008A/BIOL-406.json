{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1707"}, "description": "This course is designed for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students with a particular interest in infectious disease biology. Note that this course is not a comprehensive survey of the field and is not appropriate for students seeking a lecture course on disease. The primary objective of this course is to teach students considering a career in the biomedical sciences how to read, discuss, and question research papers effectively. Intensive classroom discussions focus on the experimental methods used, results obtained, interpretation of these results in the context of pathogen interactions with host cells and organisms, and implications for basic research and therapeutic development. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "INFECTIOUS DISEASES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19850/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-406", "path": "/courses/19850", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19850/sections", "values": [{"name": "INFECTIOUS DISEASES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-406-001", "path": "/courses/19850/sections/001", "id": "19850-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-406-001"]}]}, "id": 19850, "aliases": ["BIOL-406"]}
