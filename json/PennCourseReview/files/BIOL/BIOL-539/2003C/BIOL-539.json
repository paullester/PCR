{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1718"}, "description": "This lecture-based course will illustrate the power of genetics and molecular biology approaches in addressing a wide range of questions. This newly designed course will include in depth coverage of specific topics in the following areas: bacterial pathogenesis, prokaryotic organisms as model systems for understanding universal processes, and areas of cell biology and immunology that use prokaryotes as tools. The course includes discussion of primary research papers and is suited for PhD students interested in an independent research career in the biological sciences. The course is open for first year graduate students but if the student has no previous exposure to genetics or molecular biology, the instructor should be consulted first. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PROKAR MOLECULAR GENETIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3864/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.33", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.33"}, "section": {"name": "PROKAR MOLECULAR GENETIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-539-401", "path": "/courses/3864/sections/401", "id": "3864-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-539-401", "CAMB-539-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/3864/sections/401/reviews/1300-MING-H--YUK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1300-MING-H--YUK", "first_name": "MING H.", "last_name": "YUK", "id": "1300-MING-H--YUK", "name": "MING H.
