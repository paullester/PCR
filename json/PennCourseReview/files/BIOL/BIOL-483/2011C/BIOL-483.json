{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/225"}, "description": "This course investigates epigenetic phenomena: heritable alternate states of gene activity that do not result from an alteration in nucleotide composition (mutations). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate genome accessibility and cell differentiation. They play a key role in normal development and in oncogenesis. For example both mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and nuclear transfer (cloning) are subject to epigenetic regulation. Amongst the epigenetic mechanisms we will discuss in this course are chromatin organization, histone modification, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. The course is geared toward advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students and is a combination of lectures, student presentations and research presentations by guest speakers. Students will work with the current scientific literature. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "EPIGENETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24082/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.31", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.05", "rWorkRequired": "2.19", "rInstructorAccess": "3.63", "rReadingsValue": "3.19", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.11"}, "section": {"name": "EPIGENETICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-483-401", "path": "/courses/24082/sections/401", "id": "24082-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-483-401", "CAMB-483-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/24082/sections/401/reviews/186-DORIS-WAGNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/186-DORIS-WAGNER", "first_name": "DORIS", "last_name": "WAGNER", "id": "186-DORIS-WAGNER", "name": "DORIS WAGNER"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "24082-401-186-DORIS-WAGNER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-483", "path": "/courses/24082", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24082/sections", "values": [{"name": "EPIGENETICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-483-401", "path": "/courses/24082/sections/401", "id": "24082-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-483-401", "CAMB-483-401"]}]}, "id": 24082, "aliases": ["BIOL-483", "CAMB-483"]}
