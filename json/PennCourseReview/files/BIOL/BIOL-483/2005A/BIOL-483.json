{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/225"}, "description": "This course investigates epigenetic phenomena: heritable alternate states of gene activity that do not result from an alteration in nucleotide composition (mutations). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate genome accessibility and cell differentiation. They play a key role in normal development and in oncogenesis. For example both mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and nuclear transfer (cloning) are subject to epigenetic regulation. Amongst the epigenetic mechanisms we will discuss in this course are chromatin organization, histone modification, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. The course is geared toward advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students and is a combination of lectures, student presentations and research presentations by guest speakers. Students will work with the current scientific literature. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "EPIGENETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10145/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.53", "rDifficulty": "2.95", "rStimulateInterest": "3.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.74", "rCourseQuality": "3.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.84", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "2.95", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.42", "rCommAbility": "3.37", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "EPIGENETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-483-001", "path": "/courses/10145/sections/001", "id": "10145-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-483-001", "CAMB-483-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/10145/sections/001/reviews/186-DORIS-WAGNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/186-DORIS-WAGNER", "first_name": "DORIS", "last_name": "WAGNER", "id": "186-DORIS-WAGNER", "name": "DORIS WAGNER"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "10145-001-186-DORIS-WAGNER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-483", "path": "/courses/10145", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10145/sections", "values": [{"name": "EPIGENETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-483-001", "path": "/courses/10145/sections/001", "id": "10145-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-483-001", "CAMB-483-001"]}]}, "id": 10145, "aliases": ["BIOL-483", "CAMB-483"]}
