{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2749"}, "description": "In this course, Penn students teach a series of hands-on activities to students in biology classes at a local high school. Each week, Penn students learn the relevant biology background and techniques for one or two hands-on activities and then teach these activities to small groups of high school students. Topics for the hands-on activities include molecular biology, genetics, and evolution. The course begins with several classes concerning successful approaches to teaching biology in urban high schools. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "LEARN BIOL BY TEACH BIOL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6245/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.17", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "LEARN BIOL BY TEACH BIOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-150-001", "path": "/courses/6245/sections/001", "id": "6245-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/6245/sections/001/reviews/203-INGRID-L-WALDRON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/203-INGRID-L-WALDRON", "first_name": "INGRID L", "last_name": "WALDRON", "id": "203-INGRID-L-WALDRON", "name": "INGRID L WALDRON"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "6245-001-203-INGRID-L-WALDRON"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "LEARN BIOL BY TEACH BIOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-150-001", "path": "/courses/6245/sections/001", "id": "6245-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/6245/sections/001/reviews/2741-JENNIFER-HELEN-DOHERTY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2741-JENNIFER-HELEN-DOHERTY", "first_name": "JENNIFER HELEN", "last_name": "DOHERTY", "id": "2741-JENNIFER-HELEN-DOHERTY", "name": "JENNIFER HELEN DOHERTY"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "6245-001-2741-JENNIFER-HELEN-DOHERTY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-150", "path": "/courses/6245", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6245/sections", "values": [{"name": "LEARN BIOL BY TEACH BIOL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-150-001", "path": "/courses/6245/sections/001", "id": "6245-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-150-001"]}]}, "id": 6245, "aliases": ["BIOL-150"]}
