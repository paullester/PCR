{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2748"}, "description": "The course examines \"non-avian dinosaurs\" as objects of valid scientific inquiry and strips them of their media hyperbole. Among the topics examined in detail are: their systematics, ecology (including a survey of other Mesozoic vertebrate groups, important invertebrates, and plant life), physiology, their relationships to modern birds, the facts behind their extinction, and how these animals are reconstructed and restored as living animals (including what is actually known about their reproduction and care of their offspring). No prerequisite is required and all relevant geological and biological background material will be provided as part of the course. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "BIOLOGY OF DINOSAURS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6244/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "2.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.10", "rWorkRequired": "1.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "1.60", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.10", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "BIOLOGY OF DINOSAURS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-130-001", "path": "/courses/6244/sections/001", "id": "6244-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/6244/sections/001/reviews/183-MICHAEL-J-BALSAI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/183-MICHAEL-J-BALSAI", "first_name": "MICHAEL J", "last_name": "BALSAI", "id": "183-MICHAEL-J-BALSAI", "name": "MICHAEL J BALSAI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "6244-001-183-MICHAEL-J-BALSAI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-130", "path": "/courses/6244", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6244/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOLOGY OF DINOSAURS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-130-001", "path": "/courses/6244/sections/001", "id": "6244-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-130-001"]}]}, "id": 6244, "aliases": ["BIOL-130"]}
