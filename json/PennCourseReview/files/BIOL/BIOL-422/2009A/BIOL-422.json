{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4168"}, "description": "In this course we will discuss the identification and characterization of genetic diversity in the human genome, the genetic basis of normal variable traits, and the genetic basis of human disease. The study of human genetics impacts almost every aspect of our society, from medicine to law enforcement to how we view ourselves. An ability to understand the basics of genetic analyses will serve you well since in your lifetime you are almost certain to be faced with a major decision involving your heredity; and society will be forced to make major reforms in medicine and law because of our increasing genetic knowledge. Human genetics is a topic that gets frequent attention in the press. Reports about genes for traits ranging from breast cancer to criminal behavior are constantly in the news. Our society is engaged in a debate about the implications of genetic typing, particularly with the advent of personalized genomics. By the end of this class you should be able to sort fact from fiction and to have a better understanding of the science behind the study of the human genome. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "HUMAN GENETICS & GENOMIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15418/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.44", "rDifficulty": "2.54", "rStimulateInterest": "2.07", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "2.35", "rReadingsValue": "1.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.32", "rCommAbility": "2.07", "rInstructorQuality": "2.31"}, "section": {"name": "HUMAN GENETICS & GENOMIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-422-001", "path": "/courses/15418/sections/001", "id": "15418-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-422-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/15418/sections/001/reviews/4261-SARAH-A--TISHKOFF", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4261-SARAH-A--TISHKOFF", "first_name": "SARAH A.", "last_name": "TISHKOFF", "id": "4261-SARAH-A--TISHKOFF", "name": "SARAH A.
