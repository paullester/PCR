{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1241"}, "description": "The main focus of this course is to provide an overview of techniques used by conservation biologists and wildlife managers. The emphasis is on field work and most of each day will be spent outside attempting to collect real data on real organisms. The general topics covered will be survey techniques for forest birds, small mammals, white-tailed deer, and vegetation. A brief introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Global Positioning Systems is also included. Each topic will start with an introductory lecture the night before and then field work during the day. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQ CONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19858/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.44", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.56", "rInstructorAccess": "2.56", "rReadingsValue": "1.63", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.89", "rCommAbility": "2.11", "rInstructorQuality": "2.22"}, "section": {"name": "ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQ CONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-465-001", "path": "/courses/19858/sections/001", "id": "19858-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-465-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/19858/sections/001/reviews/5133-RICHARD-WILLIAM-LUCAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5133-RICHARD-WILLIAM-LUCAS", "first_name": "RICHARD WILLIAM", "last_name": "LUCAS", "id": "5133-RICHARD-WILLIAM-LUCAS", "name": "RICHARD WILLIAM LUCAS"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "19858-001-5133-RICHARD-WILLIAM-LUCAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-465", "path": "/courses/19858", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19858/sections", "values": [{"name": "ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQ CONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-465-001", "path": "/courses/19858/sections/001", "id": "19858-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-465-001"]}]}, "id": 19858, "aliases": ["BIOL-465"]}
