The emphasis is on field work and most of each day will be spent outside attempting to collect real data on real organisms. The general topics covered will be survey techniques for forest birds, small mammals, white-tailed deer, and vegetation. A brief introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Global Positioning Systems is also included. Each topic will start with an introductory lecture the night before and then field work during the day. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQ CONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21364/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.33", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "2.08", "rRecommendMajor": "2.58", "rCourseQuality": "2.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "1.75", "rReadingsValue": "1.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.25", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "1.58"}, "section": {"name": "ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQ CONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-465-001", "path": "/courses/21364/sections/001", "id": "21364-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-465-001"]}, "comments": "The main focus of this course is to provide an overview of techniques used by conservation biologists and wildlife managers.

Many were dissatisfied with the way the course was structured. One student warned that this class was not for the faint of heart, and should be taken by students truly interested in pursuing a career in ecology.\r\n\r\nThe field trip in this class occurs over Spring Break, upsetting many students who claimed the \u201cthe professor had almost no respect for their time, sometimes giving menial tasks to do just to fill up time. There was very little flexibility in scheduling of course content.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis course is taught at the Smithsonian Institution's Conservation & Research Center adjacent to Shenandoah National Park just outside Front Royal, Virginia in January (preparatory lectures at Penn) and March (field work at CRC). Students must pre-register. Prepayment of transportation and living expenses is required. Students should be prepared for strenuous, extended fieldwork under varied weather conditions. Previous field experience and introductory statistics are recommended prior to enrollment.\r\n", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/21364/sections/001/reviews/1299-WILLIAM-MCSHEA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1299-WILLIAM-MCSHEA", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "MCSHEA", "id": "1299-WILLIAM-MCSHEA", "name": "WILLIAM MCSHEA"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "21364-001-1299-WILLIAM-MCSHEA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-465", "path": "/courses/21364", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21364/sections", "values": [{"name": "ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQ CONS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-465-001", "path": "/courses/21364/sections/001", "id": "21364-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-465-001"]}]}, "id": 21364, "aliases": ["BIOL-465"]}
