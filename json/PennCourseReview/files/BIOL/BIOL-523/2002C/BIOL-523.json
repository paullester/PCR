Techniques will include large and small mammal censusing, radio tracking, analyses of the forest habitat, obeservation of captive and wild animals, and mist-netting of birds. Students should be prepared for extended periods of strenuous outdoor activity. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "TECHNIQUES IN CONS.
