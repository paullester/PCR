{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1242"}, "description": "This course is designed for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates with a particular enthusiasm for Cell Biology. Biology 480 does not attempt to cover all aspects of cell biology, and is therefore not appropriate for students seeking a lecture course which provides a comprehensive survey of the field. Rather, the primary objective of this course is to teach those students considering a career in the biomedical sciences how to read, discuss, and question original research papers effectively. Intensive classroom discussions focus on the experimental methods used, results obtained, interpretation of these results in the context of cell structure and function, and implications for further studies. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "ADVANCED CELL BIOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1390/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.36", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.64", "rRecommendMajor": "3.71", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.93", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.79", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED CELL BIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "BIOL-480-601", "path": "/courses/1390/sections/601", "id": "1390-601", "aliases": ["BIOL-480-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/1390/sections/601/reviews/1291-RANDALL-G--WORTH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1291-RANDALL-G--WORTH", "first_name": "RANDALL G.", "last_name": "WORTH", "id": "1291-RANDALL-G--WORTH", "name": "RANDALL G.
