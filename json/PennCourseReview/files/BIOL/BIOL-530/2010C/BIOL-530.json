{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5082"}, "description": "The study of dynamical interactions and assemblies of cells and molecules raises almost exactly the same kinds of questions as those raised in ecological studies of whole organisms. Systems biology is a new discipline that is bringing concepts of dynamic systems to molecular processes with many concepts and tools similar to population ecology. The goal of this seminar is to draw connections between empirical and theoretical studies of biological dynamics and assemblies at all scales from whole organisms to cells to molecules. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "SYSTEMS IN ECOLOGY&MOLB", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22738/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.25", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "SYSTEMS IN ECOLOGY&MOLB", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-530-301", "path": "/courses/22738/sections/301", "id": "22738-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-530-301", "GCB-530-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/22738/sections/301/reviews/1805-JUNHYONG-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1805-JUNHYONG-KIM", "first_name": "JUNHYONG", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "1805-JUNHYONG-KIM", "name": "JUNHYONG KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "22738-301-1805-JUNHYONG-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-530", "path": "/courses/22738", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22738/sections", "values": [{"name": "SYSTEMS IN ECOLOGY&MOLB", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-530-301", "path": "/courses/22738/sections/301", "id": "22738-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-530-301", "GCB-530-301"]}]}, "id": 22738, "aliases": ["BIOL-530", "GCB-530"]}
