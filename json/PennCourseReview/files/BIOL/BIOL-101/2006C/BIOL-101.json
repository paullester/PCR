{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/209"}, "description": "General principles of biology that have been established by studies of microbes, animals, and plants and the viruses of these organisms will be covered. Emphasis will be on the basic chemistry of life, cell biology, molecular biology, and genetics. The study of developmental pathways and evolutionary trends in life cycles will be explored using plants as model organisms. \n\nBiology Majors and Pre-Medical students should take either BIOL 101 or 121. BIOL 101 is the companion course to BIOL 102, may be taken before or after BIOL 102. \n\nLab fee $150. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "INTRO BIOLOGY A", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8593/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "3.37", "rStimulateInterest": "2.71", "rRecommendMajor": "3.39", "rCourseQuality": "2.34", "rWorkRequired": "3.32", "rInstructorAccess": "2.45", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.32", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO BIOLOGY A", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-101-001", "path": "/courses/8593/sections/001", "id": "8593-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-101-001"]}, "comments": "Most students had high praise for Dr. Poethig, especially for his clear interest in his field, incorporation of different media into lectures, and good sense of humor.
