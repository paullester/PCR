Students who take this course must have a basic background in Mendelian genetics, having completed a prior Biology introductory course (101 and 102, or 121). Students will read the original text of evolution, Origins of the Species, by Charles Darwin, and additional readings on Blackboard as complements to a standard textbook. Such readings emphasize the focus on evolution research and methodology placed in this course.\r\n\r\nGrades were determined from two midterms, a term paper and a comprehensive final exam. Recitation participation and attendance also factored in to students\u2019 grades. Students commented that this course moved at a fast pace, and that it was \u201chard to keep up\u201d without the textbook. Sometimes lectures were difficult to follow because there were no lecture slides for at least part of the course, and diagrams on the board were not always clearly labeled. However, later on in the semester, Professor Schmidt began providing lecture slides. \r\n\r\nStudents seemed to enjoy Professor Schmidt\u2019s lectures. Students described him as \u201cknowledgeable\u201d and \u201cfunny,\u201d and his lectures as \u201cinteresting.\u201d One student commented, \u201cThe professor speaks very well, but some concepts are not explained clearly.\u201d Students rated Professor Schmidt as very accessible, and one student noted his \u201cemphasis on a very fair grading system.\u201d Overall, students said they enjoyed the course and the professor, but issues with clarity and pace made it hard at times.\r\n", "num_students": 51, "path": "/courses/19843/sections/001/reviews/191-PAUL-STUTZ-SCHMIDT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/191-PAUL-STUTZ-SCHMIDT", "first_name": "PAUL STUTZ", "last_name": "SCHMIDT", "id": "191-PAUL-STUTZ-SCHMIDT", "name": "PAUL STUTZ SCHMIDT"}, "num_reviewers": 43, "id": "19843-001-191-PAUL-STUTZ-SCHMIDT"}]
