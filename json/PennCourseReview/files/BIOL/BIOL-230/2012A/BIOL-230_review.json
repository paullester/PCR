Additionally, they felt the course touched on the more \u201cnuanced concepts\u201d and forced student to \u201cthink about the context\u201d of the material, beyond strict memorization.  At the same time, however, students complained that the course was \u201call over the place\u201d and lacked organization.  Overall, students felt that the material was very interesting, but the course was structured in a confusing manner.\r\n\r\n\tProfessor Schmidt was described mainly as lacking a \u201cstrong and organized style of instruction.\u201d  While many felt that he explained difficult topics well, more students felt Professor Schmidt could have communicated the material more clearly, often since he had many tangents and an erratic lecturing style.  One student also described him as \u201cboring.\u201d  Professor Schmidt was noted for being \u201caccessible\u201d and easy to communicate with outside of the classroom, however.\r\n\r\n\tStudents said this course was difficult, mainly due to the professor\u2019s teaching style.  Students appreciated having only two midterms and enjoyed having a final paper, which \u201cmade the science more real.\u201d  Students highly recommend this course for majors, but do not recommend it for non-majors.
