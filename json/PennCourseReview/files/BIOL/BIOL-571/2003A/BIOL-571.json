{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1243"}, "description": "Biology 571 is concerned with recent developments in the identification and characterization of proteins using high-sensitivity, high-resolution mass spectrometric (MS) techniques. Several new MS technologies, including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), electrospray ionization (ESI) and fast atom/ion bombardment (FAB) are making the study of biomolecules routine. Working from the original literature (and some work that has yet to be published), this course will emphasize how, in what is now the post-genomic functional genomic era, this technology has given rise to and sustains proteomics in all its guises, from the study of single molecules to the temporal and spatial definition of the total protein complement, the 'proteome', of a cell. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "PROTEOMICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1395/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "1.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.09", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "PROTEOMICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-571-301", "path": "/courses/1395/sections/301", "id": "1395-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-571-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/1395/sections/301/reviews/1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "first_name": "PHILIP ARTHUR", "last_name": "REA", "id": "1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA", "name": "PHILIP ARTHUR REA"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "1395-301-1802-PHILIP-ARTHUR-REA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-571", "path": "/courses/1395", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1395/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROTEOMICS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-571-301", "path": "/courses/1395/sections/301", "id": "1395-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-571-301"]}]}, "id": 1395, "aliases": ["BIOL-571"]}
