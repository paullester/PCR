{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5381"}, "description": "Biology is flooded with data that cannot be understood without computational analysis and modeling. Computational Biology is a subfield of natural science where quantitative approaches are used to discover and understand biological and medical phenomena. The goal of this course is to develop a deep understanding of techniques and concepts used in Computational Biology. The course will strive to focus on a small set of approaches to gain both theoretical and practical issues such as programming and the use of programs, as well as theoretical issues such as algorithm design, statistical data analysis, theory of algorithms and statistics. Topics to be discussed include theory of computing, probability theory, multivariate statistics, molecular evolution, and network models. Grading is primarily based on 3 project reports. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRO TO COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL MODELING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28632/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.70", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "2.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.70", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "2.55", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL MODELING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-437-401", "path": "/courses/28632/sections/401", "id": "28632-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-437-401", "GCB-536-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/28632/sections/401/reviews/1805-JUNHYONG-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1805-JUNHYONG-KIM", "first_name": "JUNHYONG", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "1805-JUNHYONG-KIM", "name": "JUNHYONG KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "28632-401-1805-JUNHYONG-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-437", "path": "/courses/28632", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28632/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL MODELING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "BIOL-437-401", "path": "/courses/28632/sections/401", "id": "28632-401", "aliases": ["BIOL-437-401", "GCB-536-401"]}]}, "id": 28632, "aliases": ["BIOL-437", "GCB-536"]}
