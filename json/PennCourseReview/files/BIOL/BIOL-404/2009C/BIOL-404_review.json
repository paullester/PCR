It requires BIOL202 and BIOL221 as prerequisites. This section is offered through the College of Liberal and Professional Studies.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-two comments submitted by students, fifteen gave positive reviews, while two gave negative reviews. Many students said the course was \u201cworthwhile\u201d and taught them a lot, and one even said it was \u201cthe best one I have taken at Penn.\u201d Negative reviews, however, reported that learning was too \u201cbasic,\u201d covering one chapter in two months. A common theme in reviews was the use of online group discussions outside of class \u2013 some liked it, some wanted less of it, and a few hated it. In general, students liked the problem-solving dynamics and in-class discussions, although one reviewer suggested adding problem sets and practice problems to further students\u2019 understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nIn general, students rated Professor Cancro very highly as \u201ca wonderful lecturer\u201d who presented the material \u201calmost like a story that keeps you involved.\u201d Students also commented that he really gets the point across, and he encourages students to \u201cthink in an outside-of-the-proverbial-box type of fashion.\u201d However, a few reviewers gave words of caution. One student noted \u201chis tendency to put people on the spot,\u201d and another reviewer wrote scathingly that the instructor \u201cmakes fun of people he calls on.\u201d There was one complaint that Professor Cancro spent too much time regaling the class with stories from his personal experiences, instead of teaching immunobiology.\r\n\r\nMany biology majors and some post-baccalaureate pre-med students took this class. Students who did comment on course difficulty said that it was a lot of work and concepts were \u201cquite difficult.\u201d In addition to a research paper, there were exams and required postings to an online discussion board.", "num_students": 67, "path": "/courses/17036/sections/601/reviews/202-MICHAEL-P-CANCRO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/202-MICHAEL-P-CANCRO", "first_name": "MICHAEL P", "last_name": "CANCRO", "id": "202-MICHAEL-P-CANCRO", "name": "MICHAEL P CANCRO"}, "num_reviewers": 48, "id": "17036-601-202-MICHAEL-P-CANCRO"}]
