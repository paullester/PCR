{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3292"}, "description": "Evolution provides the unifying framework for the biological sciences and has been confirmed by a huge and diverse body of evidence. Public opinion polls show, however, that evolution continues to be socially and politically controversial in the United States. In this freshman seminar, we will explore the scientific basis for evolution by reading and discussing historical sources, a current nonspecialist text on evolution, and selected papers and articles from the scientific and popular literature. With our knowledge of evolutionary fact and theory as background, we will also discuss social and political opposition to the teaching of evolution. Grading will be based on participation in class discussions and on performance in several brief writing assignments. There is no course prerequisite, but high school introductory biology would be helpful. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DESCENT WITH MODIFICATN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28611/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.21", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "3.40", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.79"}, "section": {"name": "DESCENT WITH MODIFICATN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-014-301", "path": "/courses/28611/sections/301", "id": "28611-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-014-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/28611/sections/301/reviews/1286-PAUL-D--SNIEGOWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1286-PAUL-D--SNIEGOWSKI", "first_name": "PAUL D.", "last_name": "SNIEGOWSKI", "id": "1286-PAUL-D--SNIEGOWSKI", "name": "PAUL D.
