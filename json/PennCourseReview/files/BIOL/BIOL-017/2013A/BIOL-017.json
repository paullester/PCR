{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4166"}, "description": "This course will examine the ways in which humans manipulate - and have been manipulated by - the organisms we depend on for food, with particular emphasis on the biological factors that influence this interaction. The first part of the course will cover the biology, genetics, evolution, and breeding of cultivated plants and animals; the second part will concern the ecological, economic, and political factors that influence food production. Lab activities include demonstrations and field trips to local farms. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "THE BIOLOGY OF FOOD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29953/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.44", "rTAQuality": "2.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "1.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.39", "rCommAbility": "3.52", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "THE BIOLOGY OF FOOD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-017-001", "path": "/courses/29953/sections/001", "id": "29953-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-017-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 41, "path": "/courses/29953/sections/001/reviews/208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG", "first_name": "RICHARD SCOTT", "last_name": "POETHIG", "id": "208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG", "name": "RICHARD SCOTT POETHIG"}, "num_reviewers": 34, "id": "29953-001-208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-017", "path": "/courses/29953", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29953/sections", "values": [{"name": "THE BIOLOGY OF FOOD", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-017-001", "path": "/courses/29953/sections/001", "id": "29953-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-017-001"]}]}, "id": 29953, "aliases": ["BIOL-017"]}
