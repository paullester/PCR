The first part of the course will cover the biology, genetics, evolution, and breeding of cultivated plants and animals; the second part will concern the ways in which food/plants can cause and cure human disease. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "DNA, DIET, AND DISEASE: The Biology of Food", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21344/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.39", "rDifficulty": "2.45", "rStimulateInterest": "2.74", "rRecommendMajor": "2.39", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.77", "rReadingsValue": "1.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.90", "rCommAbility": "3.03", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12"}, "section": {"name": "DNA, DIET, AND DISEASE: The Biology of Food", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "BIOL-017-001", "path": "/courses/21344/sections/001", "id": "21344-001", "aliases": ["BIOL-017-001"]}, "comments": "This non-science-major course presents major themes in biology by examining the nature of food and the ways in which humans modify, and have been modified by, the organisms they eat. The first part of the course concerns the chemistry, structure, and physiology of plants and animals, and provides brief introduction to human nutrition. The second part of the course deals with evolution and genetics in the context of the origin and genetic modification of domesticated organisms. Finally, the course explores how food is produced and the place of agriculture in the global economy. Lectures will be supplemented by demonstrations, laboratory exercises, field trips, and movies.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was a mind-expanding class,\u201d one student said.
