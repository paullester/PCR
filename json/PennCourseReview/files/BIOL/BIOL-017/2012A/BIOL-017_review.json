The first part of the course covers the biology, genetics, evolution, and breeding of cultivated plants and animals; the second part is concerned with the ways in which food/plants can cause and cure human disease. This course was offered as an ABCS course.\r\n\r\nStudents universally seemed to enjoy this class, calling it \u201ca fantastic and eye-opening course,\u201d \u201cincredibly interesting,\u201d and \u201ca true pleasure.\u201d A number of students noted the relevancy of the material to students\u2019 lives. Several students noted that the class was \u201cat times gratuitously challenging,\u201d the opinion seeming to be that the exams did not cover what the lectures did.\r\n\r\nProfessor Poethig was largely praised for his teaching of this course. Students remarked that Professor Poethig had \u201cgenuine interest and enthusiasm that made the course engaging,\u201d was \u201cpassionate,\u201d \u201ca great professor.\u201d One student remarked, however, that while he was \u201cso smart,\u201d he \u201coften forgets that his students aren\u2019t as knowledgeable as he is.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost of the class agreed that the material was often difficult, with one student remarking that the course was \u201cdefinitely not as easy of a science course as I expected.\u201d Midterms were thought to be challenging and \u201cvery obscure.\u201d The students were divided over their recommendations as to what types of students should take the class. Though it was \u201cdesigned as a science class for non-majors,\u201d many believed that the class was too difficult for non-science majors. However, equally as many held the opposite view, saying that they would \u201crecommend this class to anyone\u201d and that the course presented \u201cjust the right amount of biology information for a non-major.\u201d", "num_students": 43, "path": "/courses/27043/sections/001/reviews/208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG", "first_name": "RICHARD SCOTT", "last_name": "POETHIG", "id": "208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG", "name": "RICHARD SCOTT POETHIG"}, "num_reviewers": 42, "id": "27043-001-208-RICHARD-SCOTT-POETHIG"}]
