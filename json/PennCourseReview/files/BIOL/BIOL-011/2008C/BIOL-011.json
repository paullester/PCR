{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2481"}, "description": "Microbes are a fundamental part of life on this planet. This course will explore the causes and consequences of the distribution and abundance of microbes (microbial ecology) as well as microbial evolution on human health and disease risk. We will address the interplay between human society and microbial ecology and evolution in shaping disease risk and directing scientific study. This course will apply concepts from basic biology, ecology, and evolution to study infectious microbes as living creatures. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "HUMANS IN MICROBIAL WRLD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18343/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.92", "rDifficulty": "2.13", "rStimulateInterest": "3.38", "rRecommendMajor": "2.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.83", "rInstructorAccess": "3.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "HUMANS IN MICROBIAL WRLD", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-011-301", "path": "/courses/18343/sections/301", "id": "18343-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-011-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/18343/sections/301/reviews/3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON", "first_name": "DUSTIN", "last_name": "BRISSON", "id": "3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON", "name": "DUSTIN BRISSON"}, "num_reviewers": 24, "id": "18343-301-3902-DUSTIN-BRISSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-011", "path": "/courses/18343", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18343/sections", "values": [{"name": "HUMANS IN MICROBIAL WRLD", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-011-301", "path": "/courses/18343/sections/301", "id": "18343-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-011-301"]}]}, "id": 18343, "aliases": ["BIOL-011"]}
