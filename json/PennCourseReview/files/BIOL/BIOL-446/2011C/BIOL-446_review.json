Specifically, it focuses on problems of estimation and hypothesis,\r\ntesting in biology and related areas.\r\nMany students reported that this course was an \u201cexcellent course\u201d and the\r\nmaterial was \u201cinteresting and very applicable to both research and daily life.\u201d Students\r\nalso noted that the course was \u201creally an introduction to statistics,\u201d not necessarily a pure\r\nbiology class. Additionally, students appreciated that there was no textbook used in this\r\ncourse and that all the information could be articulated through lectures and problem sets.\r\nStudents agreed that Professor Plotkin \u201cexplains everything clearly and succinctly\r\nin class,\u201d making up for the lack of textbook. They also explained that he is \u201cextremely\r\neloquent and straightforward\u201d in lecture. Despite being a great lecturer in class, a few\r\nstudents complained that he could be \u201cunapproachable\u201d one on one. Overall, though,\r\nstudents believed Professor Plotkin was an \u201camazing professor\u201d who was \u201cvery\r\nknowledgeable in the subject.\u201d\r\nStudents for the most part found the exams to be \u201cvery fair,\u201d though students were\r\nforced to \u201cmemorize definitions\u201d and were not necessarily tested enough on\r\ncomputational problems. Additionally, some students thought the \u201chomework took too\r\nlong to complete,\u201d while others wished there had been more practice problems and study\r\nmaterials. The workload, though, was not too great and this course was highly\r\nrecommended to anyone interested in scientific research.", "num_students": 176, "path": "/courses/24078/sections/001/reviews/4757-JOSHUA-B--PLOTKIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4757-JOSHUA-B--PLOTKIN", "first_name": "JOSHUA B.", "last_name": "PLOTKIN", "id": "4757-JOSHUA-B--PLOTKIN", "name": "JOSHUA B.
