{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2479"}, "description": "The skeleton has acquired the reputation of being a rather lifeless system, designed to last well beyond the normal life span of any other organ or system in the body. Yet a closer look tells us a completely different story. Indeed, the skeleton is under construction and reconstruction continuously and it is this process that determines the strength of the bones and their durability. The skeleton serves as the main storage place for calcium and phosphorus, vital elements for virtually every function in the body. In an amazing way, a number of hormones, systemic and local, talk to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys and bones which in turn fine-tune the absorption (gut), secretion (kidneys) and release (skeleton) of calcium and phosphorus. No biology or science background required. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "ENDOCRINOL OF SKELETON", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5041/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "1.39", "rStimulateInterest": "3.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.17", "rWorkRequired": "1.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.56", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.22", "rCommAbility": "3.28", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "ENDOCRINOL OF SKELETON", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-004-301", "path": "/courses/5041/sections/301", "id": "5041-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-004-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/5041/sections/301/reviews/2410-MICHAEL-PAZIANAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2410-MICHAEL-PAZIANAS", "first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "PAZIANAS", "id": "2410-MICHAEL-PAZIANAS", "name": "MICHAEL PAZIANAS"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "5041-301-2410-MICHAEL-PAZIANAS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-004", "path": "/courses/5041", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5041/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENDOCRINOL OF SKELETON", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-004-301", "path": "/courses/5041/sections/301", "id": "5041-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-004-301"]}]}, "id": 5041, "aliases": ["BIOL-004"]}
