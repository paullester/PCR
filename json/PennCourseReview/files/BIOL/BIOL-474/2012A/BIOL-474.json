{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5382"}, "description": "Interaction of pathogens with their hosts is a complex, highly dynamic, multifactorial process. The infecting bacteria must perform several tasks simultaneously: compete with the host microbiota, protect themselves from the host immune system, navigate to a specific tissue and penetrate it. Pathogens use arrays of virulence modules including toxins, surface organelles and secretion systems during the infection and colonization. The activity of the entire virulence machinery is regulated and coordinated on multiple levels. The course will include lectures describing the basic virulence modules and building blocks, followed by seminars given by the students on recent relevant publications. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "MECH BACTERIAL VIRULENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27064/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.13", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "1.88", "rRecommendMajor": "2.63", "rCourseQuality": "1.79", "rWorkRequired": "1.75", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.44", "rCommAbility": "1.81", "rInstructorQuality": "1.95"}, "section": {"name": "MECH BACTERIAL VIRULENCE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-474-301", "path": "/courses/27064/sections/301", "id": "27064-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-474-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/27064/sections/301/reviews/6054-ILAN-ROSENSHEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6054-ILAN-ROSENSHEIN", "first_name": "ILAN", "last_name": "ROSENSHEIN", "id": "6054-ILAN-ROSENSHEIN", "name": "ILAN ROSENSHEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "27064-301-6054-ILAN-ROSENSHEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "BIOL-474", "path": "/courses/27064", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27064/sections", "values": [{"name": "MECH BACTERIAL VIRULENCE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-474-301", "path": "/courses/27064/sections/301", "id": "27064-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-474-301"]}]}, "id": 27064, "aliases": ["BIOL-474"]}
