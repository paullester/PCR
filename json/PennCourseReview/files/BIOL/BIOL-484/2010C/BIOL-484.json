{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2995"}, "description": "Cytoskeleton and cell motility plays a crucial role in many aspects of normal and pathological physiology of individual cells, tissues, and whole organisms, including morphogenesis, immune response, wound healing, oncogenesis, and infection. This course will cover current topics in cell biology with emphasis on cytoskeleton and cell motility and their roles in these processes. Lectures, student presentations, and discussions in the class will be based on primary scientific literature. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "CELL MOTILITY & CYTOSKEL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22737/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.13", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "3.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.38", "rCommAbility": "2.88", "rInstructorQuality": "2.88"}, "section": {"name": "CELL MOTILITY & CYTOSKEL", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "BIOL-484-301", "path": "/courses/22737/sections/301", "id": "22737-301", "aliases": ["BIOL-484-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/22737/sections/301/reviews/2416-TATYANA-M--SVITKINA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2416-TATYANA-M--SVITKINA", "first_name": "TATYANA M.", "last_name": "SVITKINA", "id": "2416-TATYANA-M--SVITKINA", "name": "TATYANA M.
