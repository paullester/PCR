It covers the structure and function of animals, their evolution and development, and their relationship to other animals in the environment. BIOL102 is the companion course to BIOL101, but they can be taken in either order. This course fulfills the College Sector V: Living World.\r\n\r\nStudents had mixed opinion about this course. Some students thought the course material was intriguing. Many students complained that the course had too much \u201crote memorization and no critical thinking.\u201d \r\n\r\nStudents appreciated Professor Dunham\u2019s helpful slides. Some students also praised Professor Dunham for his humor while other students thought that Professor Dunham was somewhat boring.\r\n\r\nMost students who take BIOL102 are biology majors or premedical students. Students believed the class was challenging, with a tough curve. Professor Dunham\u2019s exams were based of his slides, thus studying for exams proved to be rather easy.\r\n", "num_students": 272, "path": "/courses/25690/sections/001/reviews/190-ARTHUR-E--DUNHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/190-ARTHUR-E--DUNHAM", "first_name": "ARTHUR E.", "last_name": "DUNHAM", "id": "190-ARTHUR-E--DUNHAM", "name": "ARTHUR E.

Two one-hour daytime lectures each week plus three-hour evening lab in smaller groups. Attendance at one lab session per week is required by each student - multiple times are scheduled due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions for observing. This course requires substantial out-of-class time dedication and commitment to sharing work in small groups. \r\n\r\nStudents found this course to be interesting and enjoyable, but \"stressful\" due to lack of organization. Many students wanted strict, early deadlines to motivate them, and wanted more guidance along the way, especially for using the software required for the end-of-semester projects.\r\n\r\nStudents claimed that Professor Aguirre was helpful, but wished he could give more \"unsolicited guidance\" and felt that his attention was a bit divided since this class is shared with ASTR150.\r\n\r\nThis course is intended for science majors. Prerequisites include ASTR 001, or ASTR 007, or ASTR 011, or ASTR 012. If a student has only taken ASTR 001, MATH 240-241 will also be required.
