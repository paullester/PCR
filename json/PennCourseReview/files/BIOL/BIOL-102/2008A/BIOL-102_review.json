A 3-hr lecture, 3-hr lab per-week course, BIOL102 is a prerequisite for the biology major, recommended for students with only one year of high school biology.  This course can be taken to fulfill the Living World Sector in the College of Arts and Sciences, and can work towards fulfilling the pre-health biology lecture/lab requirement.\r\n\r\nThe course covers the general principles of animal biology.  A typical semester covers animal development, major bodily systems, physiology, evolution and ecology.  The text follows the Campbell & Reece textbook (used also for Intro to Biology A).  In addition to a $150 lab fee, a lab manual and photographic atlas must also be purchased.\r\n\r\nStudents found that Professor Kemp was easy to understand and able to stimulate their interest.  Students used the words \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d to describe his teaching ability.
