{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4365"}, "description": "This course prepares students with advanced knowledge of pain assessment, pharmacotherapy, nonpharmacological therapies and interventional techniques to address the increasing and complex needs of persons with acute and chronic pain. Safe and effective pain care is based on rational therapeutics grounded in the neurobiology of pain, pathophysiological mechanisms of pain, pain assessment practices, and principles underlying various treatment options. Students learn from nationally and internationally recognized pain experts who present the latest scientific discoveries and research related to the understanding of various pain acute and chronic pain states and pain therapies including multimodal analgesia. Through interactive, problem-based, and independent-guided learning, students apply research and evidence-based content to the care of patients in primary care, hospital, and other health care settings. Students acquire in-depth knowledge of a pain problem or issue of interest through a group assignment. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "PAIN SCIENCE AND PRACTICE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30758/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "2.24", "rTAQuality": "2.52", "rStimulateInterest": "3.08", "rRecommendMajor": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.42", "rInstructorAccess": "2.96", "rReadingsValue": "2.62", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.08", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "2.93"}, "section": {"name": "PAIN SCIENCE AND PRACTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-536-401", "path": "/courses/30758/sections/401", "id": "30758-401", "aliases": ["NURS-536-401", "MED-536-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 48, "path": "/courses/30758/sections/401/reviews/3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "first_name": "ROSEMARY C", "last_name": "POLOMANO", "id": "3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "name": "ROSEMARY C POLOMANO"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "30758-401-3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-536", "path": "/courses/30758", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30758/sections", "values": [{"name": "PAIN SCIENCE AND PRACTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "NURS-536-401", "path": "/courses/30758/sections/401", "id": "30758-401", "aliases": ["NURS-536-401", "MED-536-401"]}]}, "id": 30758, "aliases": ["NURS-536", "MED-536"]}
