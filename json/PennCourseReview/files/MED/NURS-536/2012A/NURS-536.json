{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4365"}, "description": "This course focuses on biopsychosocial aspects of the pain experience and interpatient differences and how these form the basis for understanding pain perception, physiological and behavioral reactions and response to pain interventions. Content includes an integrated overview of the neurobiology of pain, measurement pain, pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches for acute and chronic pain syndromes, health policy and care delivery models for improving pain assessment and management. Peripheral processing, neuroanatomical pathways and central integrating mechanisms involved in nociception and pain are examined. The roles of individual biochemical mediators, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are examined and linked to theeffectiveness of pharmacological and alternative methods for pain control. The challenges of pain assessment and pain management in special clinical populations are considered. Relevant topics of special interest to course participants will be introduced for class discussion in the form of student presentations. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "CURRENT TOPICS IN PAIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27899/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.82", "rDifficulty": "3.05", "rTAQuality": "2.69", "rStimulateInterest": "3.77", "rRecommendMajor": "3.76", "rCourseQuality": "3.78", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "3.77", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.32", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorQuality": "3.85"}, "section": {"name": "CURRENT TOPICS IN PAIN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-536-001", "path": "/courses/27899/sections/001", "id": "27899-001", "aliases": ["NURS-536-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/27899/sections/001/reviews/3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "first_name": "ROSEMARY C", "last_name": "POLOMANO", "id": "3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO", "name": "ROSEMARY C POLOMANO"}, "num_reviewers": 29, "id": "27899-001-3428-ROSEMARY-C-POLOMANO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "NURS-536", "path": "/courses/27899", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27899/sections", "values": [{"name": "CURRENT TOPICS IN PAIN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "NURS-536-001", "path": "/courses/27899/sections/001", "id": "27899-001", "aliases": ["NURS-536-001"]}]}, "id": 27899, "aliases": ["NURS-536"]}
