{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2934"}, "description": "This course will cover the basic concepts of three dimensional design and sculpture such as volume and mass, scale, materiality, form and meaning, context, organic vs. geometric, etc. Students will also be introduced to more contemporary areas of artmaking such as conceptual art, installation, and video and other time based arts.
