Materials will range from traditional drawing materials such as charcoal and pencil to digital photography, and will explore the use of diverse visual languages. Emphasis will be on both formal and conceptual issues, such as developing meaning through imagery, narrative, metaphor, and visual modes in contemporary culture.Projects will be structured to deal with basic concepts and techniques, and prepare students to use the studio practice as a form of participation in contemporary culture. Assorted readings will accompany the studio projects each week, covering topics ranging from color theory to critical and theoretical issues in Visual Culture. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "2 DIMENSIONS:FORM/MEANG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19416/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "3.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.29", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "2 DIMENSIONS:FORM/MEANG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "VLST-102-001", "path": "/courses/19416/sections/001", "id": "19416-001", "aliases": ["VLST-102-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/19416/sections/001/reviews/494-SHARKA-HYLAND", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/494-SHARKA-HYLAND", "first_name": "SHARKA", "last_name": "HYLAND", "id": "494-SHARKA-HYLAND", "name": "SHARKA HYLAND"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "19416-001-494-SHARKA-HYLAND"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.14"}, "section": {"name": "2 DIMENSIONS:FORM/MEANG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "VLST-102-001", "path": "/courses/19416/sections/001", "id": "19416-001", "aliases": ["VLST-102-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/19416/sections/001/reviews/2968-BRENT-WAHL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2968-BRENT-WAHL", "first_name": "BRENT", "last_name": "WAHL", "id": "2968-BRENT-WAHL", "name": "BRENT WAHL"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "19416-001-2968-BRENT-WAHL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "VLST-102", "path": "/courses/19416", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19416/sections", "values": [{"name": "2 DIMENSIONS:FORM/MEANG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "VLST-102-001", "path": "/courses/19416/sections/001", "id": "19416-001", "aliases": ["VLST-102-001"]}]}, "id": 19416, "aliases": ["VLST-102"]}
