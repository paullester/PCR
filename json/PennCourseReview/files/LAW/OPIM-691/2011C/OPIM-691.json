{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4305"}, "description": "Negotiation is the art and science of creating good agreements. This course develops managerial negotiation skills by mixing lectures and practice, using cases and exercises in which students negotiate with each other. The cases cover a wide range of problems and settings: one-shot deals between individuals, repeated negotiations, negotiations over several issues, negotiations among several parties (both within and between organizations),and cross-cultural issues. Performance in the negotiation's cases accounts for a significant portion of the course grade. OPIM 691 sections differ from LGST 806 and MGMT 691 sections in that OPIM 691 covers theoretical aspects of negotiation (including psychological theories of judgmental mistakes negotiators make) in a bit more depth, and covers fewer legal and dispute resolution issues. Students can take only one of the three courses. Cross- listed with LGST 806/MGMT 691. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24942/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.26", "rDifficulty": "1.55", "rStimulateInterest": "1.89", "rRecommendMajor": "2.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "1.93", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.55", "rCommAbility": "2.03", "rInstructorQuality": "2.03"}, "section": {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-691-401", "path": "/courses/24942/sections/401", "id": "24942-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-691-401", "LGST-806-401", "MGMT-691-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/24942/sections/401/reviews/5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "first_name": "ALBERT E", "last_name": "MANNES", "id": "5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "name": "ALBERT E MANNES"}, "num_reviewers": 32, "id": "24942-401-5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.83", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.11", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "2.48"}, "section": {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "OPIM-691-402", "path": "/courses/24942/sections/402", "id": "24942-402", "aliases": ["OPIM-691-402", "LGST-806-402", "MGMT-691-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 25, "path": "/courses/24942/sections/402/reviews/5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "first_name": "ALBERT E", "last_name": "MANNES", "id": "5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "name": "ALBERT E MANNES"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "24942-402-5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.76", "rDifficulty": "1.76", "rStimulateInterest": "2.41", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.06", "rInstructorAccess": "2.94", "rReadingsValue": "2.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.94", "rCommAbility": "2.65", "rInstructorQuality": "2.45"}, "section": {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "403", "primary_alias": "OPIM-691-403", "path": "/courses/24942/sections/403", "id": "24942-403", "aliases": ["OPIM-691-403", "LGST-806-403", "MGMT-691-403"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/24942/sections/403/reviews/5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "first_name": "ALBERT E", "last_name": "MANNES", "id": "5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES", "name": "ALBERT E MANNES"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "24942-403-5853-ALBERT-E-MANNES"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "OPIM-691", "path": "/courses/24942", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24942/sections", "values": [{"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "OPIM-691-401", "path": "/courses/24942/sections/401", "id": "24942-401", "aliases": ["OPIM-691-401", "LGST-806-401", "MGMT-691-401"]}, {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "OPIM-691-402", "path": "/courses/24942/sections/402", "id": "24942-402", "aliases": ["OPIM-691-402", "LGST-806-402", "MGMT-691-402"]}, {"name": "NEGOTIATIONS", "sectionnum": "403", "primary_alias": "OPIM-691-403", "path": "/courses/24942/sections/403", "id": "24942-403", "aliases": ["OPIM-691-403", "LGST-806-403", "MGMT-691-403"]}]}, "id": 24942, "aliases": ["OPIM-691", "LGST-806", "MGMT-691"]}
