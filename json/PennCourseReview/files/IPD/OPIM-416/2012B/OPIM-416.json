{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5290"}, "description": "In this course, students will study innovation and new product development in the context of Web-based products and services. This course lies at the intersection of product design and information technology; it is intended for students with general interests in the design of new products and/or information technology management. The course builds from a general product design methodology. For example, students begin with opportunity identification and analysis of user needs. However, the course also extends principles and practices used in innovation and new product development to information technologies in general and the Web in particular. For example, design-for-manufacturing is addressed with open-source software and Web services. Robust Engineering and Design of Experiments is applied to paper prototyping and server log analysis. The course is an interdisciplinary, integrative project-based course. Through weekly assignments, students apply the tools and techniques to the design of a new product, culminating in the initial roll-out of a working service. The course is open to juniors and seniors in SEAS or Wharton \n\n", "semester": "2012B", "name": "DES & DEV WEB-BASED PROD: Design & Dev of Web-Based Prod & Serv - NOTE: COURSE IS FULLY ON-LINE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28428/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.27", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "2.45", "rRecommendMajor": "2.55", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "1.64", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "DES & DEV WEB-BASED PROD: Design & Dev of Web-Based Prod & Serv - NOTE: COURSE IS FULLY ON-LINE", "sectionnum": "901", "primary_alias": "OPIM-416-901", "path": "/courses/28428/sections/901", "id": "28428-901", "aliases": ["OPIM-416-901", "IPD-517-901"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/28428/sections/901/reviews/936-THOMAS-Y--LEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/936-THOMAS-Y--LEE", "first_name": "THOMAS Y.", "last_name": "LEE", "id": "936-THOMAS-Y--LEE", "name": "THOMAS Y.
