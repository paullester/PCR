Many lamented however, that the \u201creadings were useless\u201d as some were from \u201cguidebooks and manuals which were impossibly mundane to read.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Yim was generally well liked by the class, although students had difficulty with his lack of preparation for class and his \u201cvery monotonous\u201d teaching style with \u201cno stimulation of student interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents generally agreed that \u201cthe sheer amount of information and work [required] was quite difficult to handle.\u201d Some students attributed this to the extreme overlap with the course lectures. Many students had a difficult time with the length and timing of the course. Students also agreed that the grading scheme was extremely challenging and the course would have been much more enjoyable had students not been worried about their grades.\r\n\r\nThis review is based on the 8 student comments which were submitted.
