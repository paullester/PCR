The course follows an overall product design methodology, including the identification of customer needs, generation of product concepts, prototyping, and design-for-manufacturing. Weekly student assignments are focused on the design of a new product and culminate in the creation of a prototype. \r\n\r\n\tStudents found that this course was a \u201cterrific integration of business and engineering\u201d. It was very interdisciplinary and hands on, a \u201cgreat introduction to the process of product design.\u201d Students further commented that they found great value in the ability to apply this course to other business classes as well as everyday life.\r\n\t\r\nThe majority of students found that Professor Robertson was an average teacher who was \u201creally laid back.\u201d However, one student found that more instruction was needed in the actual creation of the products. One student found the lectures to be particularly slow-paced, and did not think the work with legos was important. Additionally, students found the speakers to be \u201cfantastic.\u201d\r\n\t\r\nOverall, students found that this course was pretty intensive, but that there was \u201ca lot of time outside of class to work on products.\u201d Students said that the assignments were relatively small and graded merely on completion. This class is recommended to juniors and seniors in SEAS or Wharton, as it is a 400 level course. The course is intended for students with a strong career interest in new product development, entrepreneurship, and/or technology development. Many students commented that an engineering background was especially helpful for the project. However, there are no prerequisites to taking the class. \t\r\n", "num_students": 53, "path": "/courses/27965/sections/402/reviews/5506-DAVID-ROBERTSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5506-DAVID-ROBERTSON", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "ROBERTSON", "id": "5506-DAVID-ROBERTSON", "name": "DAVID ROBERTSON"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "27965-402-5506-DAVID-ROBERTSON"}]
