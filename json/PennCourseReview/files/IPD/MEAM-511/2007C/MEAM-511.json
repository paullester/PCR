{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3450"}, "description": "This is a creative & iterative problem solving course that uses a series of mechanical design challenge projects to move students into the broad realm of unpredictable often incalculable time-constrained problem solving. It explores a wide variety of problem definition, exploration and solving \"tools,\" and a variety of surrounding \"design thinking\" topics, such as ethics and the design of experience. Drawing and prototyping are used in the projects for ideation, iteration, speculation and communication. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "VISUAL THINKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13554/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.20", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.80", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-001", "path": "/courses/13554/sections/001", "id": "13554-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/13554/sections/001/reviews/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "first_name": "JENNIFER ELLEN", "last_name": "BUCK", "id": "3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "name": "JENNIFER ELLEN BUCK"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "13554-001-3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-511", "path": "/courses/13554", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13554/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-001", "path": "/courses/13554/sections/001", "id": "13554-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-001"]}]}, "id": 13554, "aliases": ["MEAM-511"]}
