{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3450"}, "description": "This is a creative & iterative problem solving course that uses a series of mechanical design challenge projects to move students into the broad realm of unpredictable often incalculable time-constrained problem solving. It explores a wide variety of problem definition, exploration and solving \"tools,\" and a variety of surrounding \"design thinking\" topics, such as ethics and the design of experience. Drawing and prototyping are used in the projects for ideation, iteration, speculation and communication. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "VISUAL THINKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9217/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "1.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.80", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.87", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "1.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-001", "path": "/courses/9217/sections/001", "id": "9217-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/9217/sections/001/reviews/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "first_name": "JENNIFER ELLEN", "last_name": "BUCK", "id": "3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "name": "JENNIFER ELLEN BUCK"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "9217-001-3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-511", "path": "/courses/9217", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9217/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-001", "path": "/courses/9217/sections/001", "id": "9217-001", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-001"]}]}, "id": 9217, "aliases": ["MEAM-511"]}
