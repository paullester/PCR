{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3450"}, "description": "This is a creative & iterative problem solving course that uses a series of mechanical design challenge projects to move students into the broad realm of unpredictable often incalculable time-constrained problem solving. It explores a wide variety of problem definition, exploration and solving \"tools,\" and a variety of surrounding \"design thinking\" topics, such as ethics and the design of experience. Drawing and prototyping are used in the projects for ideation, iteration, speculation and communication. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "VISUAL THINKING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18964/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.18", "rDifficulty": "2.91", "rStimulateInterest": "3.55", "rRecommendMajor": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.36", "rWorkRequired": "3.82", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.09", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.27", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-401", "path": "/courses/18964/sections/401", "id": "18964-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-401", "IPD-511-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/18964/sections/401/reviews/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "first_name": "JENNIFER ELLEN", "last_name": "BUCK", "id": "3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK", "name": "JENNIFER ELLEN BUCK"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "18964-401-3365-JENNIFER-ELLEN-BUCK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-511", "path": "/courses/18964", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18964/sections", "values": [{"name": "VISUAL THINKING", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-401", "path": "/courses/18964/sections/401", "id": "18964-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-401", "IPD-511-401"]}]}, "id": 18964, "aliases": ["MEAM-511", "IPD-511"]}
