{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3450"}, "description": "This is a creative & iterative problem solving course that uses a series of mechanical design challenge projects to move students into the broad realm of unpredictable often incalculable time-constrained problem solving. It explores a wide variety of problem definition, exploration and solving \"tools,\" and a variety of surrounding \"design thinking\" topics, such as ethics and the design of experience. Drawing and prototyping are used in the projects for ideation, iteration, speculation and communication. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "CREATIVE THINKING&DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22026/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "2.27", "rRecommendMajor": "2.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "2.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.07", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.18"}, "section": {"name": "CREATIVE THINKING&DESIGN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-511-401", "path": "/courses/22026/sections/401", "id": "22026-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-511-401", "IPD-511-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/22026/sections/401/reviews/5408-ALBERT-S--CHO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5408-ALBERT-S--CHO", "first_name": "ALBERT S.", "last_name": "CHO", "id": "5408-ALBERT-S--CHO", "name": "ALBERT S.
