{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4990"}, "description": "This course teaches advanced mechatronics concepts that include the design and implementation of networked embedded systems, large-scale actuation, advanced sensing and control. This course pairs design school and engineering students to form interdisciplinary teams that together design and build electro-mechanical reactive spaces and scenic/architectural elements in the context of the performing arts. The two disciplinary groups will be treated separately and receive credit for different courses (ARCH746 will be taught concurrently and in some cases co-located) as they will be learning different things. Engineering students gain design sensibilities and advanced mechatronics in the form of networked embedded processing and protocols for large scale actuation and sensing. Design students learn elementary mechatronics and design reactive architectures and work with engineering students to build them. The class will culminate in a collection of short performance pieces inspired by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream with both mechatronic and human performers from the Pig Iron Theater Troupe. A final paper will be required that is ready for conference proceedings. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "ADV MECHATRNC REAC SPACE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27738/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.90", "rDifficulty": "2.90", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.44", "rReadingsValue": "2.70", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.20", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "2.83"}, "section": {"name": "ADV MECHATRNC REAC SPACE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-516-401", "path": "/courses/27738/sections/401", "id": "27738-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-516-401", "IPD-516-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/27738/sections/401/reviews/3053-MARK-YIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3053-MARK-YIM", "first_name": "MARK", "last_name": "YIM", "id": "3053-MARK-YIM", "name": "MARK YIM"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "27738-401-3053-MARK-YIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MEAM-516", "path": "/courses/27738", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27738/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADV MECHATRNC REAC SPACE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MEAM-516-401", "path": "/courses/27738/sections/401", "id": "27738-401", "aliases": ["MEAM-516-401", "IPD-516-401"]}]}, "id": 27738, "aliases": ["MEAM-516", "IPD-516"]}
