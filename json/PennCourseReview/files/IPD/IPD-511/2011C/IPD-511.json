{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5233"}, "description": "This is a creative & iterative problem solving course that uses a series of mechanical design challenge projects to move students into the broad realm of unpredictable often incalculable time-constrained problem solving. It explores a wide variety of problem definition, exploration and solving \"tools,\" and a variety of surrounding \"design thinking\" topics, such as ethics and the design of experience. Drawing and prototyping are used in the projects for ideation, iteration, speculation and communication. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CREATIVE THINKING&DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24605/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.50", "rDifficulty": "1.63", "rStimulateInterest": "1.88", "rRecommendMajor": "1.75", "rCourseQuality": "1.75", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "1.75", "rInstructorQuality": "2.13"}, "section": {"name": "CREATIVE THINKING&DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "IPD-511-001", "path": "/courses/24605/sections/001", "id": "24605-001", "aliases": ["IPD-511-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/24605/sections/001/reviews/5408-ALBERT-S--CHO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5408-ALBERT-S--CHO", "first_name": "ALBERT S.", "last_name": "CHO", "id": "5408-ALBERT-S--CHO", "name": "ALBERT S.
