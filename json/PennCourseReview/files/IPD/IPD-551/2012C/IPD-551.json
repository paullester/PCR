{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5553"}, "description": "This studio is structured for IPD students as an intensive, interdisciplinary exploration of Design as purposeful for Integrated Product Design. The goal of the studio is to give students a firsthand experience of various processes involved in creating successful integrated product designs.This first semester of the four-semester studio sequence focuses on giving students experience developing designs based on a range of starting points: form, function, materiality and manufacturing process. Students will practice design through rigorous, consistent processes for thinking through the evolution of their ideas. In this course, they will go through an entire design process from conceptualization to design to producing prototypes. They will be taught to focus on the specifics of their designs, causing them to be conscious of what drives their choices as designers and providing them with a wider range of tools to design from in successive projects. Course work will involve readings, assignments, class participation, in-class exercises, a mid-term presentation and a final submission. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "DESIGN PROCESSES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29133/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.70", "rTAQuality": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.27", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.40", "rCommAbility": "2.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "DESIGN PROCESSES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "IPD-551-001", "path": "/courses/29133/sections/001", "id": "29133-001", "aliases": ["IPD-551-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/29133/sections/001/reviews/5386-SARAH-E--ROTTENBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5386-SARAH-E--ROTTENBERG", "first_name": "SARAH E.", "last_name": "ROTTENBERG", "id": "5386-SARAH-E--ROTTENBERG", "name": "SARAH E.
