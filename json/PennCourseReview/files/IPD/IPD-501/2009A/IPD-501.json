{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4295"}, "description": "The majority of today's engineered products move through an advanced computer-aided workflow which greatly speeds design and process time. This course will explore the fundamental components of this workflow through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and a semester design project. General course topics include: fundamental design principles, project definition and needfinding, advanced computer-aided design, rapid prototyping techniques, computer-controlled machining, and an in-depth exploration of the modern analysis and simulation tools that have revolutionized the way in which products are designed. Enrollment is limited. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "INTEG COMP-AIDED DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15945/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.43", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "2.79", "rCourseQuality": "2.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.36", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "1.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.21", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "INTEG COMP-AIDED DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "IPD-501-001", "path": "/courses/15945/sections/001", "id": "15945-001", "aliases": ["IPD-501-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/15945/sections/001/reviews/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "first_name": "JONATHAN", "last_name": "FIENE", "id": "3916-JONATHAN-FIENE", "name": "JONATHAN FIENE"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "15945-001-3916-JONATHAN-FIENE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "IPD-501", "path": "/courses/15945", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15945/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTEG COMP-AIDED DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "IPD-501-001", "path": "/courses/15945/sections/001", "id": "15945-001", "aliases": ["IPD-501-001"]}]}, "id": 15945, "aliases": ["IPD-501"]}
