{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5749"}, "description": "Cities can be exciting, dense, noisy, and dirty. They are places where the unexpected is expected to occur. One thing is certain however - urban settings are always full of the diversity of human expressivity. Through readings, videos, guest lectures, and field trips, this course explores the symbolic meanings and social production of urban life and culture in Philadelphia, the nation's fifth largest city. The urban landscape provides an intensification of cultural processes. How humans experience them are more easily studied and understood in an urban setting, giving this class the opportunity to explore social relational and cultural themes such as the ethnic city, the contested city, the global city, and the creative city. This course is structured as a seminar with readings from Philadelphia and other urban settings that introduce students to the study of the city as a site of everyday practice. In addition, the course offers step-by-step training in conducting an ethnographic fieldwork project on an urban topic of the student's interest. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "URBAN ETHNOGRAPHY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31112/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN ETHNOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "URBS-427-640", "path": "/courses/31112/sections/640", "id": "31112-640", "aliases": ["URBS-427-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 5, "path": "/courses/31112/sections/640/reviews/6189-JOAN-L-SAVERINO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6189-JOAN-L-SAVERINO", "first_name": "JOAN L", "last_name": "SAVERINO", "id": "6189-JOAN-L-SAVERINO", "name": "JOAN L SAVERINO"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "31112-640-6189-JOAN-L-SAVERINO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-427", "path": "/courses/31112", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31112/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN ETHNOGRAPHY", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "URBS-427-640", "path": "/courses/31112/sections/640", "id": "31112-640", "aliases": ["URBS-427-640"]}]}, "id": 31112, "aliases": ["URBS-427"]}
