{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2177"}, "description": "This course will focus on how urban communities are shaped by the nonprofit sector and the billions of philanthropic dollars that fuel their work. By bridging theory and practice, the class explores what dynamics are at play to deliver vital services or programs in healthcare, education, the arts, community development, and other issues. The course will also focus on these important questions: (1) Whose responsibility is the public good? How is that responsibility shared by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors? and (2) Given that responsibility for the public good, which individuals and groups make the decisions about how to serve the public good? How are these decisions made, and who benefits from these decisions? Students will consider these questions in an interdisciplinary context that will bring a historical and philosophical perspective to the examination of the values and institutions that characterize the contemporary philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "PHILANTHROPY & THE CITY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6002/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.62", "rStimulateInterest": "3.23", "rRecommendMajor": "3.77", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.54", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.92", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.38", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PHILANTHROPY & THE CITY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-404-601", "path": "/courses/6002/sections/601", "id": "6002-601", "aliases": ["URBS-404-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/6002/sections/601/reviews/1765-GREG-H--GOLDMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1765-GREG-H--GOLDMAN", "first_name": "GREG H.", "last_name": "GOLDMAN", "id": "1765-GREG-H--GOLDMAN", "name": "GREG H.
