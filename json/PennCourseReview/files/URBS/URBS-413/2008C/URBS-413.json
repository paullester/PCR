{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2179"}, "description": "In recent years, \"sprawl\" has emerged as a hot issue in the media and in legislative forums from township boards to Congress. This survey course will assess the issue by asking and answering a series of questions about sprawl. Students will gain a broad overview of urban form and the forces that define it: transportation, market demand, government policy, and geography. Particular attention will be given to the impacts on open space, mobility, environmental quality, community vitality, and taxation. Solutions to the problems identified including state policies, local and regional planning (esp. transportation and open space), and physical design (new urbanism, transit-oriented development, conservation subdivision) will be considered. The Philadelphia region will be highlighted as a case study throughout the course, although significant attention will be given to developments elsewhere. Speakers will be invited from the following groups: smart-growth advocates, home builders, transportation advocates, community development corporations, environmental groups, and government. Field trips to experience urban form will include a visit to a new urbanist community (Eagleview, Chester County) and the Littlest Streets (Philadelphia). \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "SPRAWL:DREAM/NIGHTMARE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19409/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "SPRAWL:DREAM/NIGHTMARE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-413-601", "path": "/courses/19409/sections/601", "id": "19409-601", "aliases": ["URBS-413-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/19409/sections/601/reviews/1767-PATRICK-M-STARR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1767-PATRICK-M-STARR", "first_name": "PATRICK M", "last_name": "STARR", "id": "1767-PATRICK-M-STARR", "name": "PATRICK M STARR"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "19409-601-1767-PATRICK-M-STARR"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "2.38", "rStimulateInterest": "2.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.38"}, "section": {"name": "SPRAWL:DREAM/NIGHTMARE", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-413-601", "path": "/courses/19409/sections/601", "id": "19409-601", "aliases": ["URBS-413-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/19409/sections/601/reviews/5093-KATHERINE-S--DAMSGAARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5093-KATHERINE-S--DAMSGAARD", "first_name": "KATHERINE S.", "last_name": "DAMSGAARD", "id": "5093-KATHERINE-S--DAMSGAARD", "name": "KATHERINE S.
