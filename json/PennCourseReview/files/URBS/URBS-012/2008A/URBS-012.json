{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4860"}, "description": "How do we understand the places in which we live? How do we \"read\" a city? What is the relationship between workplace and home, downtown and suburb, inner city and gated communities, department store and mall, row house and ranch house? How are our lives defined by place, and how do we function as both the producers and products of place? The city is a social and a spatial system, and its organization both reflects and reproduces social categories of race, class, and gender. The current city is also the product of past decisions about where to locate communities and how to allocate resources. Through reading sociological, historical, theoretical, and primary texts, through studying maps and photographs, and through your ethnographic explorations, we will explore the presence of the past in the city around us, the evolution of different kinds of urban and suburban places, and the encoding of wealth and power as well as inequality and poverty in the urban landscape. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "HIST/POLITICS OF PLACE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20930/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.10", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.80", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "HIST/POLITICS OF PLACE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-012-301", "path": "/courses/20930/sections/301", "id": "20930-301", "aliases": ["URBS-012-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/20930/sections/301/reviews/1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER", "first_name": "ERIC C.", "last_name": "SCHNEIDER", "id": "1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER", "name": "ERIC C.
