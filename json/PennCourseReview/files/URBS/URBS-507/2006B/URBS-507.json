{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3586"}, "description": "This course will explore the role of intellectuals in viewing, thinking about, and shaping urban life and urban development. We'll explore the theoretical frameworks that various intellectuals have created for helping to understand cities as well as the practical influences that intellectuals have had on cities and on the ways urban environments are experienced. Historians, sociologists, political scientists, architects, and philosophers are some of the thinkers we will encounter. The range of material covered will extend from ancient cities of the Far East to contemporary views of the city of the 21st century. \n\n", "semester": "2006B", "name": "CITIES AND INTELLECTUALS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9897/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.75", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.50", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.00", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "CITIES AND INTELLECTUALS", "sectionnum": "940", "primary_alias": "URBS-507-940", "path": "/courses/9897/sections/940", "id": "9897-940", "aliases": ["URBS-507-940"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/9897/sections/940/reviews/1768-MARK-P-GAIGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1768-MARK-P-GAIGE", "first_name": "MARK P", "last_name": "GAIGE", "id": "1768-MARK-P-GAIGE", "name": "MARK P GAIGE"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "9897-940-1768-MARK-P-GAIGE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-507", "path": "/courses/9897", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9897/sections", "values": [{"name": "CITIES AND INTELLECTUALS", "sectionnum": "940", "primary_alias": "URBS-507-940", "path": "/courses/9897/sections/940", "id": "9897-940", "aliases": ["URBS-507-940"]}]}, "id": 9897, "aliases": ["URBS-507"]}
