{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4689"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the principles behind Geographic Information Science and applications of (GIS) in the social sciences. Examples of GIS applications in social services, public health, criminology, real estate, environmental justice, education, history, and urban studies will be used to illustrate how GIS integrates, displays, and facilitates analysis of spatial data through maps and descriptive statistics. Students will learn to create data sets through primary and secondary data collection, map their own data, and create maps to answer research questions. The course will consist of a combination of lecture and lab. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "GIS APPL IN SOC SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19406/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "1.56", "rStimulateInterest": "2.11", "rRecommendMajor": "2.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.11", "rWorkRequired": "1.78", "rInstructorAccess": "2.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "1.89", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00"}, "section": {"name": "GIS APPL IN SOC SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-330-401", "path": "/courses/19406/sections/401", "id": "19406-401", "aliases": ["URBS-330-401", "URBS-530-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/19406/sections/401/reviews/5092-KENNEN-S--GROSS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5092-KENNEN-S--GROSS", "first_name": "KENNEN S.", "last_name": "GROSS", "id": "5092-KENNEN-S--GROSS", "name": "KENNEN S.
