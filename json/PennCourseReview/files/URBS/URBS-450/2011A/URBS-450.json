{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1140"}, "description": "This course is divided into three segments: a brief historical background on the origins and changing goals of urban redevelopment; a detailed review of contemporary housing problems and the implementation of program responses by public, private and neighborhood groups; an overview of economic development efforts with a focus on a series of contemporary projects as case studies. The format is that of a seminar, mixing lecture, discussion, and guest speakers who are responsible for housing and economic development in the Phialdelphia area. The focus is not only on policy choices but on the mechanics of financing, implementation, and attaining employment goals. The course requirements include a take-home, mid-term essay of 5-7 pages, a final case study, and tours of development projects in Philadelphia. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "URBAN REDEVELOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22533/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "1.81", "rRecommendMajor": "2.63", "rCourseQuality": "2.13", "rWorkRequired": "2.13", "rInstructorAccess": "2.60", "rReadingsValue": "1.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.69", "rCommAbility": "2.25", "rInstructorQuality": "2.25"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN REDEVELOP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-450-301", "path": "/courses/22533/sections/301", "id": "22533-301", "aliases": ["URBS-450-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/22533/sections/301/reviews/1204-FELIPE-GOROSTIZA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1204-FELIPE-GOROSTIZA", "first_name": "FELIPE", "last_name": "GOROSTIZA", "id": "1204-FELIPE-GOROSTIZA", "name": "FELIPE GOROSTIZA"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "22533-301-1204-FELIPE-GOROSTIZA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-450", "path": "/courses/22533", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22533/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN REDEVELOP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-450-301", "path": "/courses/22533/sections/301", "id": "22533-301", "aliases": ["URBS-450-301"]}]}, "id": 22533, "aliases": ["URBS-450"]}
