{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3257"}, "description": "This course uses the history of black displacement to examine community power and advocacy. It examines the methods of advocacy (e.g. case, class, and legislative) and political action through which community activists can influence social policy development and community and institutional change. The course also analyzes selected strategies and tactics of change and seeks to develop alternative roles in the group advocacy, lobbying, public education and public relations, electoral politics, coalition building, and legal and ethical dilemmas in political action. Case studies of neighborhood displacement serve as central means of examining course topics. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "Neighborhood Displacement & Community Power", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11071/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.15", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.92", "rCourseQuality": "2.46", "rWorkRequired": "2.15", "rInstructorAccess": "3.08", "rReadingsValue": "2.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.62", "rCommAbility": "2.85", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "Neighborhood Displacement & Community Power", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-448-601", "path": "/courses/11071/sections/601", "id": "11071-601", "aliases": ["URBS-448-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/11071/sections/601/reviews/1218-WALTER-D-PALMER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1218-WALTER-D-PALMER", "first_name": "WALTER D", "last_name": "PALMER", "id": "1218-WALTER-D-PALMER", "name": "WALTER D PALMER"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "11071-601-1218-WALTER-D-PALMER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-448", "path": "/courses/11071", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11071/sections", "values": [{"name": "Neighborhood Displacement & Community Power", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-448-601", "path": "/courses/11071/sections/601", "id": "11071-601", "aliases": ["URBS-448-601"]}]}, "id": 11071, "aliases": ["URBS-448"]}
