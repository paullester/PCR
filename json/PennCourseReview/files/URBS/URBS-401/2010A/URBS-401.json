{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4436"}, "description": "Students in the fall Urban Studies Senior Seminar (URBS400) whose papers are exceptional and show promise for publication will be invited to participate in the spring honors seminar. If they choose to participate, honors seminar participants will revise and refine their research/papers with the goal of their work for publication in an academic journal relevant to the topic. The seminar meets periodically during the semester, structured around a set of assignments geared to facilitate the process of revision. Students will be assigned to read each other's work and meetings take the form of a workshop with students reporting on progress and providing feedback to improve and develop each other's papers. In addition to completing the revised paper for a grade, participants in the honors seminar are required to present their work to a wider Urban Studies audience in a special session at the end of the semester and to provide documentation that they have submitted their papers for publication. Students who successfully complete the Honors Seminar will graduate with distinction in the major, noted on their transcripts and in the graduation materials \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "URBAN STUDIES HONORS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26860/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.00", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorQuality": "3.86"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN STUDIES HONORS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-401-301", "path": "/courses/26860/sections/301", "id": "26860-301", "aliases": ["URBS-401-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/26860/sections/301/reviews/1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER", "first_name": "ERIC C.", "last_name": "SCHNEIDER", "id": "1191-ERIC-C--SCHNEIDER", "name": "ERIC C.
