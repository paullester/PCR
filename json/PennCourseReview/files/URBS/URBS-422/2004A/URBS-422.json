{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2932"}, "description": "This course will examine the intriguing and complicated relationship between cities, democracy, and citizenship. We will study this intellectual kinship in a variety of ways. First, we will review its roots in the ancient Greek polis and through the Middle Ages. We will then focus on the city/democracy/citizenship nexus in the United States by exploring such topics as: 1)Urban immigration and political machines; 3) Deurbanization and the rise of the economic underclass; and 4) Social equity and regionalism. We will conclude by looking at the effects on democracy and citizenship of what has been termed the global city. Increasingly, these technology-intensive locales may be diverging from - and even replacing - nations as sites for the emergence of new forms of citizenship. We will explore the positive and negative implications of this development for cities, democracy, and citizenship. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "CITIES DEMOC CITIZENSHIP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7224/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-422", "path": "/courses/7224", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7224/sections", "values": [{"name": "CITIES DEMOC CITIZENSHIP", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "URBS-422-640", "path": "/courses/7224/sections/640", "id": "7224-640", "aliases": ["URBS-422-640"]}]}, "id": 7224, "aliases": ["URBS-422"]}
