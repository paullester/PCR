{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2932"}, "description": "This course will examine the intriguing and complicated relationship between cities, democracy, and citizenship. We will study this intellectual kinship in a variety of ways. First, we will review its roots in the ancient Greek polis and through the Middle Ages. We will then focus on the city/democracy/citizenship nexus in the United States by exploring such topics as: 1)Urban immigration and political machines; 3) Deurbanization and the rise of the economic underclass; and 4) Social equity and regionalism. We will conclude by looking at the effects on democracy and citizenship of what has been termed the global city. Increasingly, these technology-intensive locales may be diverging from - and even replacing - nations as sites for the emergence of new forms of citizenship. We will explore the positive and negative implications of this development for cities, democracy, and citizenship. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "Cities, Citizenship and Democracy", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9624/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.71", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.86", "rWorkRequired": "2.43", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.71", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "Cities, Citizenship and Democracy", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-422-601", "path": "/courses/9624/sections/601", "id": "9624-601", "aliases": ["URBS-422-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/9624/sections/601/reviews/1768-MARK-P-GAIGE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1768-MARK-P-GAIGE", "first_name": "MARK P", "last_name": "GAIGE", "id": "1768-MARK-P-GAIGE", "name": "MARK P GAIGE"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "9624-601-1768-MARK-P-GAIGE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-422", "path": "/courses/9624", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9624/sections", "values": [{"name": "Cities, Citizenship and Democracy", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-422-601", "path": "/courses/9624/sections/601", "id": "9624-601", "aliases": ["URBS-422-601"]}]}, "id": 9624, "aliases": ["URBS-422"]}
