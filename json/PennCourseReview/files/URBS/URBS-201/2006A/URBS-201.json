{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2171"}, "description": "This course views health care from the perspective of social justice by exploring political, social, racial/ethnic, and economic factors that impact access to care. It incorporates a broad definition of health (beyond the medical model) and focuses on inner-city populations disproportionately affected by health care disparities. A broad range of issues and their interrelationships are discussed; these include infant mortality, childhood asthma, violence, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS and mental illness. Guest speakers who are key figures in the Philadelphia area are invited for class presentations. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "URBAN HEALTH SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8432/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.27", "rDifficulty": "2.64", "rStimulateInterest": "3.45", "rRecommendMajor": "3.82", "rCourseQuality": "3.82", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82", "rReadingsValue": "3.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.55", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN HEALTH SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-201-301", "path": "/courses/8432/sections/301", "id": "8432-301", "aliases": ["URBS-201-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/8432/sections/301/reviews/1762-BETTINA-HOERLIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1762-BETTINA-HOERLIN", "first_name": "BETTINA", "last_name": "HOERLIN", "id": "1762-BETTINA-HOERLIN", "name": "BETTINA HOERLIN"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "8432-301-1762-BETTINA-HOERLIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-201", "path": "/courses/8432", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8432/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN HEALTH SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-201-301", "path": "/courses/8432/sections/301", "id": "8432-301", "aliases": ["URBS-201-301"]}]}, "id": 8432, "aliases": ["URBS-201"]}
