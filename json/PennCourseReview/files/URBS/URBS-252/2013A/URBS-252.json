{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1136"}, "description": "This course will examine the state of urban journalism today with special emphasis on how large newspapers are redefining themselves, and the news, in an era of dwindling readership and growing financial pressures. The course will look at online journalism, ethics, and alternative sources of news, and will explore the techniques journalists use in reporting the news. Students will report and write four pieces of their own about Philadelphia and its environs. The course is taught by Dan Rubin, metro columnist and former foreign correspondent for the Philadelphia Inquirer. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "URBAN JOURNALISM", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31103/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.40", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.90", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorQuality": "3.70", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN JOURNALISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-252-301", "path": "/courses/31103/sections/301", "id": "31103-301", "aliases": ["URBS-252-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/31103/sections/301/reviews/4586-DANIEL-RUBIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4586-DANIEL-RUBIN", "first_name": "DANIEL", "last_name": "RUBIN", "id": "4586-DANIEL-RUBIN", "name": "DANIEL RUBIN"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "31103-301-4586-DANIEL-RUBIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-252", "path": "/courses/31103", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31103/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN JOURNALISM", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-252-301", "path": "/courses/31103/sections/301", "id": "31103-301", "aliases": ["URBS-252-301"]}]}, "id": 31103, "aliases": ["URBS-252"]}
