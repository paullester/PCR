{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5604"}, "description": "Transportation affects every aspect of American society; from how we get to work or school, to how we shop and play. Transportation policy at all levels of American government has serious implications for social justice and economic development. Moreover, some of today's most intense political battles center on transportation policy across America and within its cities, be it funding High Speed Rail in California or placing bike lanes in the heart of Manhattan. Transportation and American Society will expose students to the role transportation has played the development of America and its cities as well as its impact on politics and society. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "Transportation and American Society", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29752/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.30", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20"}, "section": {"name": "Transportation and American Society", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-419-601", "path": "/courses/29752/sections/601", "id": "29752-601", "aliases": ["URBS-419-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/29752/sections/601/reviews/5550-ARIEL-BEN-AMOS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5550-ARIEL-BEN-AMOS", "first_name": "ARIEL", "last_name": "BEN-AMOS", "id": "5550-ARIEL-BEN-AMOS", "name": "ARIEL BEN-AMOS"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "29752-601-5550-ARIEL-BEN-AMOS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-419", "path": "/courses/29752", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29752/sections", "values": [{"name": "Transportation and American Society", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "URBS-419-601", "path": "/courses/29752/sections/601", "id": "29752-601", "aliases": ["URBS-419-601"]}]}, "id": 29752, "aliases": ["URBS-419"]}
