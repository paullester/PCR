{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3256"}, "description": "Urban lifestyles have a reciprocal relationship with urban form. While lifestyle might have been once determined by the circumstances of birth, limited horizons and a hierarchical society, today social and physical mobility combined with increasing affluence makes lifestyle yet another choice in the construction of a modern identity. Lifestyle choices have become an engine of urban growth and are instrumental in the transformation of urban life and form of the city. \n\nThis course will examine the underlying forces that are continuing to transform urban form and the relationship of these forces to contemporary urban lifestyles. The spatialization of contemporary life and the physical forms and fabric that support it call into question traditional definitions of 'urban life' and 'city form,' The seminar's broad context is the interface between the physical/psychological permanence of the existing traditional city and the changing spatial and cultural landscape of a new urban realm defined by consumption culture, new technologies and the media age. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "POST INDUSTRIAL CITY: Urban Ideologies in the Media Age", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8443/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.38", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.75", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.63"}, "section": {"name": "POST INDUSTRIAL CITY: Urban Ideologies in the Media Age", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-429-301", "path": "/courses/8443/sections/301", "id": "8443-301", "aliases": ["URBS-429-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/8443/sections/301/reviews/1197-GEORGE-E-THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1197-GEORGE-E-THOMAS", "first_name": "GEORGE E", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "1197-GEORGE-E-THOMAS", "name": "GEORGE E THOMAS"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "8443-301-1197-GEORGE-E-THOMAS"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.25", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "POST INDUSTRIAL CITY: Urban Ideologies in the Media Age", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-429-301", "path": "/courses/8443/sections/301", "id": "8443-301", "aliases": ["URBS-429-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/8443/sections/301/reviews/3205-SUSAN-NIGRA-SNYDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3205-SUSAN-NIGRA-SNYDER", "first_name": "SUSAN NIGRA", "last_name": "SNYDER", "id": "3205-SUSAN-NIGRA-SNYDER", "name": "SUSAN NIGRA SNYDER"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "8443-301-3205-SUSAN-NIGRA-SNYDER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-429", "path": "/courses/8443", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8443/sections", "values": [{"name": "POST INDUSTRIAL CITY: Urban Ideologies in the Media Age", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-429-301", "path": "/courses/8443/sections/301", "id": "8443-301", "aliases": ["URBS-429-301"]}]}, "id": 8443, "aliases": ["URBS-429"]}
