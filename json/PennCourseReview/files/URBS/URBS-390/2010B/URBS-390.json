{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4874"}, "description": "Urban Agriculture is a growing global trend. This course examines urban agriculture as an issue of sustainablity, social justice, public health, and vacant land. It explores the potential of urban agriculture in both the Global North and South to provide a safe and secure source of food to city residents. Major topics include sustainable agricultural practices, operational and spatial requirements, distribution systems, and access to fresh food. Using Philadelphia as a laboratory, the course explores its robust agricultural scene of community gardens, guerilla gardens, and entrepreneurial farms, as well as its distribution system including programs such as City harvest, the emerging Common Market, and established farmers' markets. The course will integrate lectures about sustainable agricultural practices with field trips to and hands-on work at community gardens and farms. \n\n", "semester": "2010B", "name": "URBAN AGRICULTURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21208/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.43", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "URBAN AGRICULTURE", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "URBS-390-910", "path": "/courses/21208/sections/910", "id": "21208-910", "aliases": ["URBS-390-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/21208/sections/910/reviews/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "first_name": "MICHAEL P", "last_name": "NAIRN", "id": "2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN", "name": "MICHAEL P NAIRN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "21208-910-2831-MICHAEL-P-NAIRN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-390", "path": "/courses/21208", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21208/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBAN AGRICULTURE", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "URBS-390-910", "path": "/courses/21208/sections/910", "id": "21208-910", "aliases": ["URBS-390-910"]}]}, "id": 21208, "aliases": ["URBS-390"]}
