The goal will be to link substantive research questions to appropriate research methods. Micro-computer based quantitative methods, demographic techniques, and ethnographic approaches will be the primary foci of the course. In addition to classroom assignments, students will have the opportunity to undertake their own research involving micro-based statistical analysis of data files which address relevant and timely public policy issues. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "INTRO URBAN RESEARCH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16545/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.80", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.19", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.62", "rInstructorAccess": "3.52", "rReadingsValue": "2.24", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.52", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorQuality": "3.41"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO URBAN RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-200-301", "path": "/courses/16545/sections/301", "id": "16545-301", "aliases": ["URBS-200-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/16545/sections/301/reviews/4585-MATHEW-JAMIESON-CREIGHTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4585-MATHEW-JAMIESON-CREIGHTON", "first_name": "MATHEW JAMIESON", "last_name": "CREIGHTON", "id": "4585-MATHEW-JAMIESON-CREIGHTON", "name": "MATHEW JAMIESON CREIGHTON"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "16545-301-4585-MATHEW-JAMIESON-CREIGHTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-200", "path": "/courses/16545", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16545/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO URBAN RESEARCH", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "URBS-200-301", "path": "/courses/16545/sections/301", "id": "16545-301", "aliases": ["URBS-200-301"]}]}, "id": 16545, "aliases": ["URBS-200"]}
