{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3987"}, "description": "Metropolitan Nature begins with the premise that in order to understand the complex and skewed relationship between nature and its natural resource base, we must examine different scales simultaneously. The course explores a variety of issues concerning natures role in the contemporary urban world with a focus on urban sustainability. At its core, sustainability is a radical concept. Co-opted by marketing slogans, stripped of meaning and context, it has become vague and pliable. It does, however, have a real meaning, which will form the basis for examining nature in the city.
