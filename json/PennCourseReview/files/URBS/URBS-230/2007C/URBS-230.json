{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2173"}, "description": "This course will introduce students to the principles behind Geographic Information Science and applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the social sciences. Examples of GIS applications in social services, public health, criminology, real estate, environmental justice, education, history, and urban studies will be used to illustrate how GIS integrates, displays, and facilitates analysis of spatial data through maps and descriptive statistics. Students will learn to create data sets, through primary and secondary data collection, map their own data, and generate and test research hypotheses. The course will consist of a weekly lecture and a weekly lab session. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "GIS APPL IN SOC SCIENCE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13993/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.53", "rDifficulty": "2.47", "rStimulateInterest": "3.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "3.80"}, "section": {"name": "GIS APPL IN SOC SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-230-401", "path": "/courses/13993/sections/401", "id": "13993-401", "aliases": ["URBS-230-401", "URBS-530-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/13993/sections/401/reviews/1764-AMY-HILLIER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1764-AMY-HILLIER", "first_name": "AMY", "last_name": "HILLIER", "id": "1764-AMY-HILLIER", "name": "AMY HILLIER"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "13993-401-1764-AMY-HILLIER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-230", "path": "/courses/13993", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13993/sections", "values": [{"name": "GIS APPL IN SOC SCIENCE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-230-401", "path": "/courses/13993/sections/401", "id": "13993-401", "aliases": ["URBS-230-401", "URBS-530-401"]}]}, "id": 13993, "aliases": ["URBS-230", "URBS-530"]}
