{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1797"}, "description": "Design of analog circuits and subsystems using bipolar and MOS technologies at the transistor and higher levels. Transistor level design of building block circuits such as op amps, comparators, sample and hold circuits, voltage and current references, capacitors and resistor arrays, and class AB output stages. The course will include a design project of an analog circuit. This course is similar to ESE 562, except that it will not require the use of the physical layout tools associated with VLSI design and implementation. Students who take ESE 419 will not later be eligible to take ESE 562 for credit. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "ANALOG SOLID STATE CIRC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2848/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "3.16", "rStimulateInterest": "2.11", "rRecommendMajor": "2.89", "rCourseQuality": "2.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.84", "rInstructorAccess": "2.26", "rReadingsValue": "2.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.00", "rCommAbility": "2.32", "rInstructorQuality": "2.53"}, "section": {"name": "ANALOG SOLID STATE CIRC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EE-419-401", "path": "/courses/2848/sections/401", "id": "2848-401", "aliases": ["EE-419-401", "EE-562-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/2848/sections/401/reviews/1380-KRISHNASWAMY-NAGARAJ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1380-KRISHNASWAMY-NAGARAJ", "first_name": "KRISHNASWAMY", "last_name": "NAGARAJ", "id": "1380-KRISHNASWAMY-NAGARAJ", "name": "KRISHNASWAMY NAGARAJ"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "2848-401-1380-KRISHNASWAMY-NAGARAJ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-419", "path": "/courses/2848", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2848/sections", "values": [{"name": "ANALOG SOLID STATE CIRC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EE-419-401", "path": "/courses/2848/sections/401", "id": "2848-401", "aliases": ["EE-419-401", "EE-562-401"]}]}, "id": 2848, "aliases": ["EE-419", "EE-562"]}
