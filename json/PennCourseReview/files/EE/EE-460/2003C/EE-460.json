{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/359"}, "description": "A laboratory-based course on fabricating microelectronic and micromechanical devices using photolithographic processing and related fabrication technologies. Lectures discuss: clean room procedures; microelectronic and microstructural materials; photolithograpy; diffusion, oxidation; materials deposition; etching and plasma processes. Basic laboratory processes are covered for the first two thirds of the course with students completing structures appropriate to their major in the final third. Students registering for ESE 574 will be expected to do extra work (including term paper and additional project). \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PRINC OF MICROFAB TECH", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4003/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.88", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.12", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.06", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.18", "rReadingsValue": "2.35", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.59", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "PRINC OF MICROFAB TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EE-460-401", "path": "/courses/4003/sections/401", "id": "4003-401", "aliases": ["EE-460-401", "EE-564-401", "MEAM-564-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/4003/sections/401/reviews/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "first_name": "JORGE JUAN", "last_name": "SANTIAGO", "id": "349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "name": "JORGE JUAN SANTIAGO"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "4003-401-349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-460", "path": "/courses/4003", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4003/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRINC OF MICROFAB TECH", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EE-460-401", "path": "/courses/4003/sections/401", "id": "4003-401", "aliases": ["EE-460-401", "EE-564-401", "MEAM-564-401"]}]}, "id": 4003, "aliases": ["EE-460", "EE-564", "MEAM-564"]}
