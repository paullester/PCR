{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/362"}, "description": "Explores the design aspects involved in the realization of an integrated circuit from device up to the register/subsystem level. It addresses major design methodologies with emphasis placed on the structured design. The course includes the study of MOS device characteristics, the critical interconnect and gate characteristics which determine the performance of VLSI circuits, and NMOS and CMOS logic design. Students will use state-of-the-art CAD tools to verify designs and develop efficient circuit layouts. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "DIG INTEGRATED CIR &VLSI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/362/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "1.89", "rRecommendMajor": "3.11", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "2.89", "rReadingsValue": "3.11", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.22", "rCommAbility": "2.78", "rInstructorQuality": "2.56"}, "section": {"name": "DIG INTEGRATED CIR &VLSI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-560-001", "path": "/courses/362/sections/001", "id": "362-001", "aliases": ["EE-560-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/362/sections/001/reviews/348-KENNETH-R-LAKER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/348-KENNETH-R-LAKER", "first_name": "KENNETH R", "last_name": "LAKER", "id": "348-KENNETH-R-LAKER", "name": "KENNETH R LAKER"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "362-001-348-KENNETH-R-LAKER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-560", "path": "/courses/362", "sections": {"path": "/courses/362/sections", "values": [{"name": "DIG INTEGRATED CIR &VLSI", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-560-001", "path": "/courses/362/sections/001", "id": "362-001", "aliases": ["EE-560-001"]}]}, "id": 362, "aliases": ["EE-560"]}
