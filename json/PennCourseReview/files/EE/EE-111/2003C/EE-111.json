{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1789"}, "description": "This course is designed to provide first-year undergraduate students with an introduction to some key electrical engineering concepts and topics by discussing their roles in some of the commonly used electrical engineering systems such as telephone, TV, radio, CD players, etc. Hands-on experience will be provided through a project where the students will lay-out the electrical subsystems of a line-tracking robot in the laboratory and then assemble the robot. Numerical examples and graphics will be introduced through the use of MATLAB. This course, along with two companion courses (ESE 215 and ESE 216), is also a gateway course to electrical engineering and computer engineering and telecommunications options in the ESE undergraduate curriculum. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "INTRO TO ELEC ENG", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3993/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "1.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.05", "rRecommendMajor": "3.32", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.76", "rInstructorAccess": "3.21", "rReadingsValue": "2.61", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.08", "rCommAbility": "2.84", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ELEC ENG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-111-001", "path": "/courses/3993/sections/001", "id": "3993-001", "aliases": ["EE-111-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 45, "path": "/courses/3993/sections/001/reviews/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "first_name": "JORGE JUAN", "last_name": "SANTIAGO", "id": "349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO", "name": "JORGE JUAN SANTIAGO"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "3993-001-349-JORGE-JUAN-SANTIAGO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-111", "path": "/courses/3993", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3993/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO ELEC ENG", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-111-001", "path": "/courses/3993/sections/001", "id": "3993-001", "aliases": ["EE-111-001"]}]}, "id": 3993, "aliases": ["EE-111"]}
