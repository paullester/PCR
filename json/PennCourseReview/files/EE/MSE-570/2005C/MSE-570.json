{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2008"}, "description": "Failures of classical physics and the historical basis for quantum theory. Postulates of wave mechanics; uncertainty principle, wave packets and wave-particle duality. Schrodinger equation and operators; eigenvalue problems in 1 and 3 dimensions (barriers, wells, hydrogen, atom). Perturbation theory; scattering of particles and light. Free electron theory of metals; Drude and Sommerfeld models, dispersion relations and optical properties of solids. Extensive use of computer-aided self-study will be made. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12152/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "3.30", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "2.75", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.35", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.45", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.05", "rCommAbility": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/12152/sections/401", "id": "12152-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/12152/sections/401/reviews/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "first_name": "MAHADEVAN", "last_name": "KHANTHA", "id": "3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "name": "MAHADEVAN KHANTHA"}, "num_reviewers": 20, "id": "12152-401-3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-570", "path": "/courses/12152", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12152/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/12152/sections/401", "id": "12152-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}]}, "id": 12152, "aliases": ["MSE-570", "ESE-514"]}
