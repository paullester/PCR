{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2008"}, "description": "Failures of classical physics and the historical basis for quantum theory. Postulates of wave mechanics; uncertainty principle, wave packets and wave-particle duality. Schrodinger equation and operators; eigenvalue problems in 1 and 3 dimensions (barriers, wells, hydrogen, atom). Perturbation theory; scattering of particles and light. Free electron theory of metals; Drude and Sommerfeld models, dispersion relations and optical properties of solids. Extensive use of computer-aided self-study will be made. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5621/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.44", "rDifficulty": "3.78", "rStimulateInterest": "3.44", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.89", "rReadingsValue": "3.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/5621/sections/401", "id": "5621-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/5621/sections/401/reviews/156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "first_name": "WILLIAM R", "last_name": "GRAHAM", "id": "156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "name": "WILLIAM R GRAHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "5621-401-156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-570", "path": "/courses/5621", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5621/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/5621/sections/401", "id": "5621-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}]}, "id": 5621, "aliases": ["MSE-570", "ESE-514"]}
