{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2008"}, "description": "Failures of classical physics and the historical basis for quantum theory. Postulates of wave mechanics; uncertainty principle, wave packets and wave-particle duality. Schrodinger equation and operators; eigenvalue problems in 1 and 3 dimensions (barriers, wells, hydrogen, atom). Perturbation theory; scattering of particles and light. Free electron theory of metals; Drude and Sommerfeld models, dispersion relations and optical properties of solids. Extensive use of computer-aided self-study will be made. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4435/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "3.40", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.80", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.13", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.53"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/4435/sections/401", "id": "4435-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "EE-519-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/4435/sections/401/reviews/156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "first_name": "WILLIAM R", "last_name": "GRAHAM", "id": "156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM", "name": "WILLIAM R GRAHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "4435-401-156-WILLIAM-R-GRAHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-570", "path": "/courses/4435", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4435/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/4435/sections/401", "id": "4435-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "EE-519-401"]}]}, "id": 4435, "aliases": ["MSE-570", "EE-519"]}
