{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2008"}, "description": "Failures of classical physics and the historical basis for quantum theory. Postulates of wave mechanics; uncertainty principle, wave packets and wave-particle duality. Schrodinger equation and operators; eigenvalue problems in 1 and 3 dimensions (barriers, wells, hydrogen, atom). Perturbation theory; scattering of particles and light. Free electron theory of metals; Drude and Sommerfeld models, dispersion relations and optical properties of solids. Extensive use of computer-aided self-study will be made. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23480/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "3.53", "rStimulateInterest": "1.94", "rRecommendMajor": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.24", "rWorkRequired": "3.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "1.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.47", "rCommAbility": "2.41", "rInstructorQuality": "2.53"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/23480/sections/401", "id": "23480-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/23480/sections/401/reviews/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "first_name": "MAHADEVAN", "last_name": "KHANTHA", "id": "3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "name": "MAHADEVAN KHANTHA"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "23480-401-3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-570", "path": "/courses/23480", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23480/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/23480/sections/401", "id": "23480-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}]}, "id": 23480, "aliases": ["MSE-570", "ESE-514"]}
