{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2008"}, "description": "Failures of classical physics and the historical basis for quantum theory. Postulates of wave mechanics; uncertainty principle, wave packets and wave-particle duality. Schrodinger equation and operators; eigenvalue problems in 1 and 3 dimensions (barriers, wells, hydrogen, atom). Perturbation theory; scattering of particles and light. Free electron theory of metals; Drude and Sommerfeld models, dispersion relations and optical properties of solids. Extensive use of computer-aided self-study will be made. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17756/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.95", "rDifficulty": "3.20", "rStimulateInterest": "2.79", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "2.85", "rWorkRequired": "3.20", "rInstructorAccess": "3.30", "rReadingsValue": "3.05", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "2.95", "rInstructorQuality": "3.10"}, "section": {"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/17756/sections/401", "id": "17756-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/17756/sections/401/reviews/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "first_name": "MAHADEVAN", "last_name": "KHANTHA", "id": "3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA", "name": "MAHADEVAN KHANTHA"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "17756-401-3392-MAHADEVAN-KHANTHA"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MSE-570", "path": "/courses/17756", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17756/sections", "values": [{"name": "PHYSICS OF MATERIALS I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MSE-570-401", "path": "/courses/17756/sections/401", "id": "17756-401", "aliases": ["MSE-570-401", "ESE-514-401"]}]}, "id": 17756, "aliases": ["MSE-570", "ESE-514"]}
