{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1796"}, "description": "Analysis and design of basic active circuits involving semiconductor devices including diodes, bipolar and field effect transistors. Single stage, differential, multi stage, and operational amplifiers will be discussed including their high frequency response. Oscillators, wave shaping circuits, filters, feedback, stability, and power amplifiers will also be covered. A weekly three hour laboratory will illustrate concepts and circuits discussed in the class. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "FNDMTL SOLID STATE CRCT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2847/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.96", "rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.54", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.71", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "FNDMTL SOLID STATE CRCT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-319-001", "path": "/courses/2847/sections/001", "id": "2847-001", "aliases": ["EE-319-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/2847/sections/001/reviews/1379-THAYAMKULANGARA-R--VISWANATHAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1379-THAYAMKULANGARA-R--VISWANATHAN", "first_name": "THAYAMKULANGARA R.", "last_name": "VISWANATHAN", "id": "1379-THAYAMKULANGARA-R--VISWANATHAN", "name": "THAYAMKULANGARA R.
