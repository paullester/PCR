{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1802"}, "description": "This rapidly moving course provides a formal, non-measure theoretic development of fundamental ideas in probability theory and random processes. This course is a preprequisite for subsequent courses in communication theory and telecommunications such as ESE 576 and TCOM 501. The course is also suitable for students seeking a broad graduate-level exposure to probabilistic ideas and principles with applications in diverse settings. Topics covered include: discrete and continuous probability spaces; combinatorial probabilities; conditional probability and independence; Bayes rule and the theorem of total probability density functions, and probability mass functions; independent random variables; Borel's normal law; measures of central tendency---mean, median, mode; mathematical expectation; moments; moment generating functions and characteristic functions; tail inequalities---Markov, Chebyshev, Chernoff; limit theorems; random processes; Gaussian and Poisson processes; stationarity and ergodicity; correlations functions; spectral densities; filtered random processes; bandlimited processes and the sampling theorem. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "PROB & RANDOM PROCESSES", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/2853/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "3.45", "rStimulateInterest": "3.32", "rRecommendMajor": "3.05", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "3.68", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.59"}, "section": {"name": "PROB & RANDOM PROCESSES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-530-001", "path": "/courses/2853/sections/001", "id": "2853-001", "aliases": ["EE-530-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/2853/sections/001/reviews/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "first_name": "SANTOSH S", "last_name": "VENKATESH", "id": "1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH", "name": "SANTOSH S VENKATESH"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "2853-001-1177-SANTOSH-S-VENKATESH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-530", "path": "/courses/2853", "sections": {"path": "/courses/2853/sections", "values": [{"name": "PROB & RANDOM PROCESSES", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-530-001", "path": "/courses/2853/sections/001", "id": "2853-001", "aliases": ["EE-530-001"]}]}, "id": 2853, "aliases": ["EE-530"]}
