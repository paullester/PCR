{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/354"}, "description": "Problem solving. Constructs for representing and manipulating information. Recurrence relations. Asymptotic notation for analysis of algorithms. Advanced data structures such as balanced trees. Graph algorithms: searching, spanning, shortest paths, network flows. Algorithm design paradigms: greedy, divide-and-conquer, backtracking, dynamic programming, randomization. Computational complexity: Turing machines, time and space complexity classes, NP-completeness.
