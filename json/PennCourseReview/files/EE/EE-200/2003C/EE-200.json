{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1790"}, "description": "The course provides a modern introduction to logic design. It starts with a discussion of combinational logic including logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices such as programmable logic arrays. The second part deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, sythnesis of sequential circuits, including counters, registers, and memories. State machines will be discussed next and illustrated through case studies involving computer systems examples. The use of hardware description language will be introduced. There is a companion lab-based course, ESE 201 required for EE/CTE majors. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3995/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.37", "rDifficulty": "3.18", "rStimulateInterest": "2.53", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "3.21", "rWorkRequired": "3.42", "rInstructorAccess": "3.25", "rReadingsValue": "2.49", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.82", "rCommAbility": "3.18", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-200-001", "path": "/courses/3995/sections/001", "id": "3995-001", "aliases": ["EE-200-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 57, "path": "/courses/3995/sections/001/reviews/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "first_name": "JAN", "last_name": "DER SPIEGEL", "id": "350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL", "name": "JAN DER SPIEGEL"}, "num_reviewers": 38, "id": "3995-001-350-JAN-DER-SPIEGEL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-200", "path": "/courses/3995", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3995/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRIN OF DIGITAL DESIGN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-200-001", "path": "/courses/3995/sections/001", "id": "3995-001", "aliases": ["EE-200-001"]}]}, "id": 3995, "aliases": ["EE-200"]}
