{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/360"}, "description": "The goal of this course is to provide a unified approach to modern optics, image formation, analysis, and understanding that form the theoretical basis for advanced imaging systems in use today in science, medicine and technology. The emphasis is on imaging systems that employ electromagnetic energy but the principles covered can be extending to systems employing other forms of radiant energy such as acoustical. \n\n", "semester": "2003A", "name": "OPTICS & IMAGE UNDERSTAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/1516/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "3.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.14", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.57", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.43", "rCommAbility": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71"}, "section": {"name": "OPTICS & IMAGE UNDERSTAN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-511-001", "path": "/courses/1516/sections/001", "id": "1516-001", "aliases": ["EE-511-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/1516/sections/001/reviews/356-DWIGHT-L-JAGGARD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/356-DWIGHT-L-JAGGARD", "first_name": "DWIGHT L", "last_name": "JAGGARD", "id": "356-DWIGHT-L-JAGGARD", "name": "DWIGHT L JAGGARD"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "1516-001-356-DWIGHT-L-JAGGARD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EE-511", "path": "/courses/1516", "sections": {"path": "/courses/1516/sections", "values": [{"name": "OPTICS & IMAGE UNDERSTAN", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EE-511-001", "path": "/courses/1516/sections/001", "id": "1516-001", "aliases": ["EE-511-001"]}]}, "id": 1516, "aliases": ["EE-511"]}
