{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2571"}, "description": "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of many individual nodes that operate collaboratively to monitor, sense, and control their environments. While such networks share aspects common to other types of wireless networks, such as wireless mobile ad hoc networks, battery, processing, and communication constraints of sensor nodes pose several new challenges in routing, localization, addressing, and optimization of these networks. This course will introduce the characteristics of these networks by covering recent research trends from a range of disciplines - e.g. hardware design, operating systems, information and signal processing, and communication networks. The course will briefly touch on design and programming (OS, software) of sensor networks. The main focus will be on applications of wireless sensor networks and distributed networking/communication issues in such networks. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "INTR TO WIRELESS SYSTEMS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5304/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.71", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rRecommendMajor": "2.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "2.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.83", "rCommAbility": "2.71", "rInstructorQuality": "2.43"}, "section": {"name": "INTR TO WIRELESS SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-575-401", "path": "/courses/5304/sections/401", "id": "5304-401", "aliases": ["ESE-575-401", "TCOM-511-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/5304/sections/401/reviews/2472-VIJITHA-WEERACKODY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2472-VIJITHA-WEERACKODY", "first_name": "VIJITHA", "last_name": "WEERACKODY", "id": "2472-VIJITHA-WEERACKODY", "name": "VIJITHA WEERACKODY"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "5304-401-2472-VIJITHA-WEERACKODY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ESE-575", "path": "/courses/5304", "sections": {"path": "/courses/5304/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTR TO WIRELESS SYSTEMS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ESE-575-401", "path": "/courses/5304/sections/401", "id": "5304-401", "aliases": ["ESE-575-401", "TCOM-511-401"]}]}, "id": 5304, "aliases": ["ESE-575", "TCOM-511"]}
