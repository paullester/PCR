{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4001"}, "description": "This course considers the noninvasive, quantitative, and repetitive imaging of targeted macromolecules and biological processes in living cells and organisms.Imaging advances have arisen from new technologies, probe chemistry, molecular biology, and genomic information. This course covers the physical principles underlying many of the latest techniques, and defines experimental parameters such as spatial and temporal resolution, gain, noise, and contrast. Applications to cellular and in vivo imaging are highlighted for confocal, two-photon, and force microscopies; single-molecule, CARS, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; FRET and fluorescence bleaching; mass spectroscopy; MRI, PET and SPECT. The role of molecular imaging agents comprised of proteins, organic or inorganic materials is widely discussed. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "BIOMOLEC IMAGING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21409/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.63", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "2.57", "rCourseQuality": "2.20", "rWorkRequired": "3.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.57", "rCommAbility": "2.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.70"}, "section": {"name": "BIOMOLEC IMAGING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-559-001", "path": "/courses/21409/sections/001", "id": "21409-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-559-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/21409/sections/001/reviews/1808-IVAN-JULIAN-DMOCHOWSKI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1808-IVAN-JULIAN-DMOCHOWSKI", "first_name": "IVAN JULIAN", "last_name": "DMOCHOWSKI", "id": "1808-IVAN-JULIAN-DMOCHOWSKI", "name": "IVAN JULIAN DMOCHOWSKI"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "21409-001-1808-IVAN-JULIAN-DMOCHOWSKI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CHEM-559", "path": "/courses/21409", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21409/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOMOLEC IMAGING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CHEM-559-001", "path": "/courses/21409/sections/001", "id": "21409-001", "aliases": ["CHEM-559-001"]}]}, "id": 21409, "aliases": ["CHEM-559"]}
