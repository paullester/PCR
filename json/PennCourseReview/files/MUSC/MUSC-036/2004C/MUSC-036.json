Music's power to tap into our deepest emotions makes it an indomitable political tool. This course investigates the ways in which music, and musical performance, might express ideas about self-identity, nationhood, gender, sexuality, race, and class. We'll look in detail at how different music has been appropriated to political agendas during the twentieth century, considering works such as Beethoven's 9thSymphony at the fall of the Berlin Wall, Shostakovich's music in Stalinist Russia, and jazz in Nazi Germany. More insidious forms of politics, we'll see,might be found in the presentation of women in Mozart's operas, and the identitof individual soloists in Bach's chamber music. Finally, how does music in our present-day society help reinforce or overthrow the status quo? We'll examine the social status of different musical styles such as rock and rap, and their uses in TV, film, and advertising. The last portion of the semester will be devoted to independent research projects, presented to the class in the final week of term and written up as a final paper. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "MUSIC & POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/5627/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.17", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.58", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "MUSIC & POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-036-001", "path": "/courses/5627/sections/001", "id": "5627-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-036-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/5627/sections/001/reviews/2230-LAURA-R-M--BASINI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2230-LAURA-R-M--BASINI", "first_name": "LAURA R.M.", "last_name": "BASINI", "id": "2230-LAURA-R-M--BASINI", "name": "LAURA R.M.
