{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2011"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the field of ethnomusicology through a series of case studies that explore a range of traditional, popular, and art musics from around the world. The course takes as a point of departure several works of musical ethnography, musical fiction, and musical autobiography and, through in-depth reading of these texts, close listening to assigned sound recordings, and in- class case studies, generates a context within which to think and write about music. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14859/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.52", "rDifficulty": "2.39", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "2.30", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.26", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.39", "rCommAbility": "3.17", "rInstructorQuality": "3.48"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/14859/sections/001", "id": "14859-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/14859/sections/001/reviews/1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "first_name": "TIMOTHY", "last_name": "ROMMEN", "id": "1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "name": "TIMOTHY ROMMEN"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "14859-001-1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-150", "path": "/courses/14859", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14859/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/14859/sections/001", "id": "14859-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}]}, "id": 14859, "aliases": ["MUSC-150"]}
