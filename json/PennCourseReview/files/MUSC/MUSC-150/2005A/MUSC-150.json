{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2011"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the field of ethnomusicology through a series of case studies that explore a range of traditional, popular, and art musics from around the world. The course takes as a point of departure several works of musical ethnography, musical fiction, and musical autobiography and, through in-depth reading of these texts, close listening to assigned sound recordings, and in- class case studies, generates a context within which to think and write about music. \n\n", "semester": "2005A", "name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/10742/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.81", "rDifficulty": "1.81", "rStimulateInterest": "1.95", "rRecommendMajor": "2.57", "rCourseQuality": "1.81", "rWorkRequired": "2.29", "rInstructorAccess": "2.80", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "2.33", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/10742/sections/001", "id": "10742-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 24, "path": "/courses/10742/sections/001/reviews/1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "first_name": "CAROL ANN", "last_name": "MULLER", "id": "1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "name": "CAROL ANN MULLER"}, "num_reviewers": 21, "id": "10742-001-1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-150", "path": "/courses/10742", "sections": {"path": "/courses/10742/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/10742/sections/001", "id": "10742-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}]}, "id": 10742, "aliases": ["MUSC-150"]}
