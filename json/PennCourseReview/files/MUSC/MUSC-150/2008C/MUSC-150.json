{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2011"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the field of ethnomusicology through a series of case studies that explore a range of traditional, popular, and art musics from around the world. The course takes as a point of departure several works of musical ethnography, musical fiction, and musical autobiography and, through in-depth reading of these texts, close listening to assigned sound recordings, and in- class case studies, generates a context within which to think and write about music. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19031/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.53", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "3.07", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "2.27", "rWorkRequired": "3.53", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.53", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.60", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/19031/sections/001", "id": "19031-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/19031/sections/001/reviews/1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "first_name": "CAROL ANN", "last_name": "MULLER", "id": "1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "name": "CAROL ANN MULLER"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "19031-001-1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-150", "path": "/courses/19031", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19031/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO GLOBAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/19031/sections/001", "id": "19031-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}]}, "id": 19031, "aliases": ["MUSC-150"]}
