{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2011"}, "description": "This course introduces students to the field of ethnomusicology through a series of case studies that explore a range of traditional, popular, and art musics from around the world. The course takes as a point of departure several works of musical ethnography, musical fiction, and musical autobiography and, through in-depth reading of these texts, close listening to assigned sound recordings, and in- class case studies, generates a context within which to think and write about music. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "THINKNG GLOBALLY ABT MUS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3279/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.29", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.43", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "THINKNG GLOBALLY ABT MUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/3279/sections/001", "id": "3279-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/3279/sections/001/reviews/1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "first_name": "CAROL ANN", "last_name": "MULLER", "id": "1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER", "name": "CAROL ANN MULLER"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "3279-001-1623-CAROL-ANN-MULLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-150", "path": "/courses/3279", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3279/sections", "values": [{"name": "THINKNG GLOBALLY ABT MUS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-150-001", "path": "/courses/3279/sections/001", "id": "3279-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-150-001"]}]}, "id": 3279, "aliases": ["MUSC-150"]}
