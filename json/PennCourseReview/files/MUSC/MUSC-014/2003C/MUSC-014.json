{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2345"}, "description": "This course will alternate between an analytical approach and a critical approach to the study of a wide range of songs composed throughout the 20th century. We will study musical techniques such as melody, harmony, form, rhythm, instrumentation, style, and text-setting. We will also pose far-ranging questions, such as, what makes a song a song? What makes a song a good song? What is the difference between an art song and a pop song? This course will occasionally focus on specific composers, such as Cole Porter, Charles Ives, John Harbison, and Liz Phair, and will also consider the musical ramifications of collaboration, covers and re-makes. \n\n", "semester": "2003C", "name": "SONGWRITING-20TH CENT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4438/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.89", "rDifficulty": "1.28", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "1.88", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.22", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "1.78", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.72", "rCommAbility": "2.72", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94"}, "section": {"name": "SONGWRITING-20TH CENT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MUSC-014-301", "path": "/courses/4438/sections/301", "id": "4438-301", "aliases": ["MUSC-014-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/4438/sections/301/reviews/854-ANNA-T-WEESNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/854-ANNA-T-WEESNER", "first_name": "ANNA T", "last_name": "WEESNER", "id": "854-ANNA-T-WEESNER", "name": "ANNA T WEESNER"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "4438-301-854-ANNA-T-WEESNER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-014", "path": "/courses/4438", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4438/sections", "values": [{"name": "SONGWRITING-20TH CENT", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MUSC-014-301", "path": "/courses/4438/sections/301", "id": "4438-301", "aliases": ["MUSC-014-301"]}]}, "id": 4438, "aliases": ["MUSC-014"]}
