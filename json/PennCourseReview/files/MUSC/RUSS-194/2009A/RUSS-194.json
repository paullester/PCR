{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4408"}, "description": "Russia's history has been one not only of violent wars and turbulent revolutions, but also one of a vibrant cultural creation. In this course we will examine Russian music from an ethnomusicological perspective, in relation to these historical, social and cultural contexts. Our studies will take us from the nineteenth century to the present, and from the elite music of the concert hall, to the various rural sites of music making, up to the contemporary urban dance club. Among the topics to be considered: the relationships between art music and movements in both literature and the visual arts; how music supports, subverts or simply \"avoids\" contributing to political life; how gender is performed in music; and how globalization, technological advances, and piracy change the ways music is created and used. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "Russian Music: Concert Hall to Dance Club", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16424/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "Russian Music: Concert Hall to Dance Club", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-194-401", "path": "/courses/16424/sections/401", "id": "16424-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-194-401", "MUSC-194-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/16424/sections/401/reviews/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "first_name": "STEPHEN R", "last_name": "AMICO", "id": "4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "name": "STEPHEN R AMICO"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "16424-401-4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "RUSS-194", "path": "/courses/16424", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16424/sections", "values": [{"name": "Russian Music: Concert Hall to Dance Club", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "RUSS-194-401", "path": "/courses/16424/sections/401", "id": "16424-401", "aliases": ["RUSS-194-401", "MUSC-194-401"]}]}, "id": 16424, "aliases": ["RUSS-194", "MUSC-194"]}
