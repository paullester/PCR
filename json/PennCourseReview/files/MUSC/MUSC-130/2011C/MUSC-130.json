{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2348"}, "description": "This course aims to introduce students to what it means to study the European musical tradition. Students will approach the divrese music that constitute the classical tradition from a variety of scholarly perspectives. The goal of this class is to listen deeply and think broadly. Students will consider questions such as: what sort of object is music? Where is it located? what does it mean to say a work is \"canonic\"? What is left out of the story? This class will be in dialog with other tier-one classes, and will consider what the historian can bring to the study and understanding of music. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24824/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.13", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.63", "rCourseQuality": "3.28", "rWorkRequired": "1.88", "rInstructorAccess": "3.94", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.56"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/24824/sections/001", "id": "24824-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/24824/sections/001/reviews/3395-PETER-A-MONDELLI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3395-PETER-A-MONDELLI", "first_name": "PETER A", "last_name": "MONDELLI", "id": "3395-PETER-A-MONDELLI", "name": "PETER A MONDELLI"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "24824-001-3395-PETER-A-MONDELLI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-130", "path": "/courses/24824", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24824/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/24824/sections/001", "id": "24824-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}]}, "id": 24824, "aliases": ["MUSC-130"]}
