{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2348"}, "description": "This course aims to introduce students to what it means to study the European musical tradition. Students will approach the divrese music that constitute the classical tradition from a variety of scholarly perspectives. The goal of this class is to listen deeply and think broadly. Students will consider questions such as: what sort of object is music? Where is it located? what does it mean to say a work is \"canonic\"? What is left out of the story? This class will be in dialog with other tier-one classes, and will consider what the historian can bring to the study and understanding of music. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13614/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.39", "rDifficulty": "2.72", "rStimulateInterest": "3.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.72", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.22", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.72", "rCommAbility": "3.72", "rInstructorQuality": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/13614/sections/001", "id": "13614-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/13614/sections/001/reviews/861-GARY-A-TOMLINSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/861-GARY-A-TOMLINSON", "first_name": "GARY A", "last_name": "TOMLINSON", "id": "861-GARY-A-TOMLINSON", "name": "GARY A TOMLINSON"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "13614-001-861-GARY-A-TOMLINSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-130", "path": "/courses/13614", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13614/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/13614/sections/001", "id": "13614-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}]}, "id": 13614, "aliases": ["MUSC-130"]}
