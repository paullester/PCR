{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2348"}, "description": "This course aims to introduce students to what it means to study the European musical tradition. Students will approach the divrese music that constitute the classical tradition from a variety of scholarly perspectives. The goal of this class is to listen deeply and think broadly. Students will consider questions such as: what sort of object is music? Where is it located? what does it mean to say a work is \"canonic\"? What is left out of the story? This class will be in dialog with other tier-one classes, and will consider what the historian can bring to the study and understanding of music. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "INTRO TO EURO ART MUSIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29351/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.00", "rTAQuality": "2.20", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "3.60", "rInstructorQuality": "3.29", "rCommAbility": "3.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO EURO ART MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/29351/sections/001", "id": "29351-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/29351/sections/001/reviews/4042-EMILY-IULIANO-DOLAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4042-EMILY-IULIANO-DOLAN", "first_name": "EMILY IULIANO", "last_name": "DOLAN", "id": "4042-EMILY-IULIANO-DOLAN", "name": "EMILY IULIANO DOLAN"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "29351-001-4042-EMILY-IULIANO-DOLAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-130", "path": "/courses/29351", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29351/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO EURO ART MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/29351/sections/001", "id": "29351-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}]}, "id": 29351, "aliases": ["MUSC-130"]}
