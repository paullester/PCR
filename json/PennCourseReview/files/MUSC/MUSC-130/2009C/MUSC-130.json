{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2348"}, "description": "This course aims to introduce students to what it means to study the European musical tradition. Students will approach the divrese music that constitute the classical tradition from a variety of scholarly perspectives. The goal of this class is to listen deeply and think broadly. Students will consider questions such as: what sort of object is music? Where is it located? what does it mean to say a work is \"canonic\"? What is left out of the story? This class will be in dialog with other tier-one classes, and will consider what the historian can bring to the study and understanding of music. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17769/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.93", "rStimulateInterest": "1.86", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.57", "rInstructorAccess": "2.86", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.14", "rCommAbility": "2.93", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/17769/sections/001", "id": "17769-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/17769/sections/001/reviews/844-JEFFREY-L-KALLBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/844-JEFFREY-L-KALLBERG", "first_name": "JEFFREY L", "last_name": "KALLBERG", "id": "844-JEFFREY-L-KALLBERG", "name": "JEFFREY L KALLBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 15, "id": "17769-001-844-JEFFREY-L-KALLBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-130", "path": "/courses/17769", "sections": {"path": "/courses/17769/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO-HIST WEST MUSC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-130-001", "path": "/courses/17769/sections/001", "id": "17769-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-130-001"]}]}, "id": 17769, "aliases": ["MUSC-130"]}
