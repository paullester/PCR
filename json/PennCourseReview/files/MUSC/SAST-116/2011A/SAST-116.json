{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5040"}, "description": "A great variety of song and instrumental genres have thrived in the Hindu and Muslim milieus of North India and Pakistan. In this course we examine a selection of urban and rural musics, such as instrumental music in Baluchistan, qawwali in Delhi, the garba of Gujarat, ballad singing of Rajasthan and the urban music of Calcutta. We will explore the sounds, poetry, historical, and social contexts of chosen genres and trace aspects of continuity and adaptation in the changing environment of contemporary South Asia. Readings are supplemented by audio-visual material and live performances. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "MUSIC CULT N INDIA & PAK", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22411/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "1.59", "rStimulateInterest": "2.78", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "1.61", "rInstructorAccess": "3.39", "rReadingsValue": "3.04", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.09", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.21"}, "section": {"name": "MUSIC CULT N INDIA & PAK", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-116-401", "path": "/courses/22411/sections/401", "id": "22411-401", "aliases": ["SAST-116-401", "MUSC-466-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 38, "path": "/courses/22411/sections/401/reviews/849-ALLYN-MINER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/849-ALLYN-MINER", "first_name": "ALLYN", "last_name": "MINER", "id": "849-ALLYN-MINER", "name": "ALLYN MINER"}, "num_reviewers": 36, "id": "22411-401-849-ALLYN-MINER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-116", "path": "/courses/22411", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22411/sections", "values": [{"name": "MUSIC CULT N INDIA & PAK", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-116-401", "path": "/courses/22411/sections/401", "id": "22411-401", "aliases": ["SAST-116-401", "MUSC-466-401"]}]}, "id": 22411, "aliases": ["SAST-116", "MUSC-466"]}
