Instruments to be learned include: surdo, caixa, repinique, tamborim, gaiza, and agogo, among others. In addition to weekly rehearsals, the group will participate in performances throughout the course of the semester. Undergraduate students have the option of receiving 0.5 CU if they choose, as it is an official Department Ensemble (MUSC 007-009). The ensemble is open to undergraduate as well as graduate students. No prior musical, sight-reading, or percussion experience is necessary, and all instruments are provided.\r\n\r\nThis Samba course not only teaches theory, but focuses on actually practicing and performing as an ensemble.  Students praised it as the \u201cmost enjoyable course at Penn\u201d and \u201cthe highlight of each week.\u201d  Students particularly appreciated the contrast Samba ensemble provided from other Penn courses.  The ensemble performs at Spring Fling, which was widely considered a highlight of the course.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stevens was described \u201ca wonderful man\u201d and a \u201creally helpful instructor.\u201d  He was further described as \u201creally pushing his students to succeed in Samba.\u201d  Comments about Professor Stevens were exclusively positive.\r\n\r\nGiven that the course is performance-based, students found it \u201cnot difficult at all to do well.\u201d  Students took the course for an array of reasons, although primarily as an elective.
