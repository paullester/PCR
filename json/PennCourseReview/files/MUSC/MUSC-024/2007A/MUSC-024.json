{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4081"}, "description": "This course examines medieval music from the perspective of its ritual, social and spatial contexts. Covering a wide range of musical repertories, from sacred chant, love songs of the troubadours, to the ceremonial motets of Dufay,the course asks how and where medieval men and women experienced their sounding world, and how they used musical experiences to define the sense of the self, the community and the sacred. We will consider a wide spectrum of contexts for peformance, including the church and monastery, court and castle, cities such as Paris and Florence, and the theatre of the book. Students will leave the course with a broad knowledge of medieval musical repertories, and with a deeper understanding of medieval culture. No prior musical background necessary. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "PERF IN MEDIEVAL MUSIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14850/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "PERF IN MEDIEVAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-024-001", "path": "/courses/14850/sections/001", "id": "14850-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-024-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/14850/sections/001/reviews/269-EMMA-DILLON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/269-EMMA-DILLON", "first_name": "EMMA", "last_name": "DILLON", "id": "269-EMMA-DILLON", "name": "EMMA DILLON"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "14850-001-269-EMMA-DILLON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-024", "path": "/courses/14850", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14850/sections", "values": [{"name": "PERF IN MEDIEVAL MUSIC", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-024-001", "path": "/courses/14850/sections/001", "id": "14850-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-024-001"]}]}, "id": 14850, "aliases": ["MUSC-024"]}
