Fundamentals of sitar technique, composition, and improvisation are presented and practiced in class. Class lectures and discussions, audio and video material, and reading and listening assignments on selected topics supplement practice, to provide an overview of the social and historical context and the formal structures of North Indian music in general. There are no prerequisites for the course, but some experience with instrumental or vocal music is suggested. Each student is expected to put in two hours of individual practice per week, and complete reading, audio, and written assignments. The class gives a group performance at the end of the semester. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "BEGINNING SITAR I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19280/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.58", "rDifficulty": "2.25", "rStimulateInterest": "3.83", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.42", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.92"}, "section": {"name": "BEGINNING SITAR I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-106-401", "path": "/courses/19280/sections/401", "id": "19280-401", "aliases": ["SAST-106-401", "MUSC-061-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/19280/sections/401/reviews/849-ALLYN-MINER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/849-ALLYN-MINER", "first_name": "ALLYN", "last_name": "MINER", "id": "849-ALLYN-MINER", "name": "ALLYN MINER"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "19280-401-849-ALLYN-MINER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-106", "path": "/courses/19280", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19280/sections", "values": [{"name": "BEGINNING SITAR I", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-106-401", "path": "/courses/19280/sections/401", "id": "19280-401", "aliases": ["SAST-106-401", "MUSC-061-401"]}]}, "id": 19280, "aliases": ["SAST-106", "MUSC-061"]}
