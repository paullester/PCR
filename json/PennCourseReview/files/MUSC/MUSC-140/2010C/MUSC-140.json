{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1414"}, "description": "This course surveys American musical life from the colonial period to the present. Beginning with the music of Native Americans, the European legacy, and the African Diaspora, the first part of the course treats the social and political milieu that shaped America's musical landscape. Working from this foundation, the course moves to 19th-century figures in musical composition, education, performance, and promotion. The establishment of apopular sphere, the development of concert music, and the subsequent cultural hierarchies that resulted from each realm form important threads of investigation. The course concludes with 20th-century topics, including the appearance of jazz, the trajectory of western art music in the United States, and the eventual dominance of American popular music. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "INTRO TO MUS LIFE-AMER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23494/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.90", "rDifficulty": "1.90", "rStimulateInterest": "2.76", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "2.29", "rWorkRequired": "1.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.10", "rReadingsValue": "2.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.29", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.57"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO MUS LIFE-AMER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-140-001", "path": "/courses/23494/sections/001", "id": "23494-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-140-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/23494/sections/001/reviews/1900-GUTHRIE-P--RAMSEY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1900-GUTHRIE-P--RAMSEY", "first_name": "GUTHRIE P.", "last_name": "RAMSEY", "id": "1900-GUTHRIE-P--RAMSEY", "name": "GUTHRIE P.
