{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5568"}, "description": "This course will focus on a specific repertoire of the classical tradition, and will introduce students to a broad range of music, analytical methods, and cultural context. HISTORY OF SYMPHONY (formerly Music 040) will also be offered under this number. A survey of representative symphonies by such composers as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Schumann, Brahms, Tchaikowsky, and Mahler. Historical developments will be considered, along with the effects upon symphonic literature of such major sociological changes as the emergence of the public concert hall. But the emphasis will be on the music itself--particularly on the ways we can sharpen our abilities to engage and comprehend the composers' musical rhetoric. Topics will alternate term to term. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "REPERTOIRES: HISTORY OF SYMPHONY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29346/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "1.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40"}, "section": {"name": "REPERTOIRES: HISTORY OF SYMPHONY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "MUSC-031-601", "path": "/courses/29346/sections/601", "id": "29346-601", "aliases": ["MUSC-031-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/29346/sections/601/reviews/4197-BRADLEY-R-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4197-BRADLEY-R-SMITH", "first_name": "BRADLEY R", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "4197-BRADLEY-R-SMITH", "name": "BRADLEY R SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "29346-601-4197-BRADLEY-R-SMITH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-031", "path": "/courses/29346", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29346/sections", "values": [{"name": "REPERTOIRES: HISTORY OF SYMPHONY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "MUSC-031-601", "path": "/courses/29346/sections/601", "id": "29346-601", "aliases": ["MUSC-031-601"]}]}, "id": 29346, "aliases": ["MUSC-031"]}
