{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5346"}, "description": "The relationship between music and the body may appear to be self-evident: bodies by themselves, or in consort with various technologies make and are affected by music. While this matter-of-fact schematization is certainly true,our goal in this course will be to explore with greater nuance specific instances of the complex and bidirectional interfacing between the auditory andthe somatic, critically examining the ways in which apparently natural relationships are, to greater or lesser extent, mediated. Via diverse theoretical and disciplinary vantage points, and engaging musics from a wide range of generic, geo-cultural, and historical locations, some of our broad areas of inquiry will include the ways in which bodies are situated and interact within musical environments; the connections between musical and bodily forms; music and the structuring of physical action; music and emotion; gendering and sexing of musical discourses; and the effect of modern technologyon the practices, products and conceptualizations of the (musical) body. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "MUSIC AND THE BODY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26468/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.09", "rStimulateInterest": "3.27", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.91", "rWorkRequired": "2.18", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "2.73", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.82", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18"}, "section": {"name": "MUSIC AND THE BODY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MUSC-251-301", "path": "/courses/26468/sections/301", "id": "26468-301", "aliases": ["MUSC-251-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/26468/sections/301/reviews/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "first_name": "STEPHEN R", "last_name": "AMICO", "id": "4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "name": "STEPHEN R AMICO"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "26468-301-4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-251", "path": "/courses/26468", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26468/sections", "values": [{"name": "MUSIC AND THE BODY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MUSC-251-301", "path": "/courses/26468/sections/301", "id": "26468-301", "aliases": ["MUSC-251-301"]}]}, "id": 26468, "aliases": ["MUSC-251"]}
