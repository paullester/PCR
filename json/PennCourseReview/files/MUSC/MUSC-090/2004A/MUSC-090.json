{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2877"}, "description": "This course brings together two seemingly very different subjects, the art of music and the science of psychology. Parallel theories, empirical evidence, and demonstrations of how fundamental psychological processes are used in the music repertory will explore common convergences between the two fields. Major subjects covered include psychophysics; perception and cognition of melody, rhythm, harmony, and timbre; musical structures; learning, memory, tonality, and musical style; development; emotion, affect, and aesthetics; performance, social psychology; neural processing; and the biological origins of music. \n\n", "semester": "2004A", "name": "PSYCHOLOGY OF MUSIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/6872/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.85", "rDifficulty": "2.92", "rStimulateInterest": "2.69", "rRecommendMajor": "3.15", "rCourseQuality": "2.54", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.23", "rReadingsValue": "2.23", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PSYCHOLOGY OF MUSIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-090-401", "path": "/courses/6872/sections/401", "id": "6872-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-090-401", "PSYC-413-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/6872/sections/401/reviews/1633-EUGENE-NARMOUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1633-EUGENE-NARMOUR", "first_name": "EUGENE", "last_name": "NARMOUR", "id": "1633-EUGENE-NARMOUR", "name": "EUGENE NARMOUR"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "6872-401-1633-EUGENE-NARMOUR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-090", "path": "/courses/6872", "sections": {"path": "/courses/6872/sections", "values": [{"name": "PSYCHOLOGY OF MUSIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "MUSC-090-401", "path": "/courses/6872/sections/401", "id": "6872-401", "aliases": ["MUSC-090-401", "PSYC-413-401"]}]}, "id": 6872, "aliases": ["MUSC-090", "PSYC-413"]}
