{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5692"}, "description": "Stage, Screen, Recording (formerly Music 30). Pure pleasure or pure torture: Opera is said to be both. Music 33 is an introduction to opera based on its 400-year history from 1600 to the end of the 20th century. The course is open to all students, and ability to read music is not necessary. Issues covered include the relationships between words, action, and music in opera; singers and their power; opera as spectacle; opera in film; and the experience of live performance. The course will focus on a specific repertoire of the classical tradition, and will introduce students to a broad range of music, analytical methods, and cultural context. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "HISTORY OF OPERA: STAGE, SCREEN, RECORDING", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30699/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.55", "rStimulateInterest": "3.73", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "1.91", "rInstructorQuality": "3.55", "rCommAbility": "3.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "HISTORY OF OPERA: STAGE, SCREEN, RECORDING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-033-001", "path": "/courses/30699/sections/001", "id": "30699-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-033-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/30699/sections/001/reviews/4916-BROOKE-H-MCCORKLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4916-BROOKE-H-MCCORKLE", "first_name": "BROOKE H", "last_name": "MCCORKLE", "id": "4916-BROOKE-H-MCCORKLE", "name": "BROOKE H MCCORKLE"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "30699-001-4916-BROOKE-H-MCCORKLE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-033", "path": "/courses/30699", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30699/sections", "values": [{"name": "HISTORY OF OPERA: STAGE, SCREEN, RECORDING", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-033-001", "path": "/courses/30699/sections/001", "id": "30699-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-033-001"]}]}, "id": 30699, "aliases": ["MUSC-033"]}
