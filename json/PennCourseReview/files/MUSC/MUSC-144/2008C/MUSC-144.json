{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4741"}, "description": "This course will introduce and examine the ways in which commercially-mediated, Western popular musics and popular music discourses are implicated in the constructions of genders and sexualities and, additionally, the lines between such constructions and specifically musical forms of expressive culture. These issues will be examined through theoretical (sometimes ethnographically or sociologically based) texts, as well as audio/visual materials, and will begin with representative readings on gender and sexuality, followed by those devoted to theorizing popular music and affect (broadly defined). Although the course is broken up into the general rubrics of \"femininity,\" \"masculinity,\" and \"sexuality,\" this segregation is purposely artificial, and indeed part of this course's goal will be to investigate how these dynamics work together in the production of gendered and sexed subjects in contemporary society. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "POPULAR MUSIC & GENDER", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19029/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.75", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "POPULAR MUSIC & GENDER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-144-001", "path": "/courses/19029/sections/001", "id": "19029-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-144-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/19029/sections/001/reviews/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "first_name": "STEPHEN R", "last_name": "AMICO", "id": "4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "name": "STEPHEN R AMICO"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "19029-001-4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-144", "path": "/courses/19029", "sections": {"path": "/courses/19029/sections", "values": [{"name": "POPULAR MUSIC & GENDER", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-144-001", "path": "/courses/19029/sections/001", "id": "19029-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-144-001"]}]}, "id": 19029, "aliases": ["MUSC-144"]}
