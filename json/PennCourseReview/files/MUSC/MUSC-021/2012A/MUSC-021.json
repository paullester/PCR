It aims to introduce students to a variety of music, and a range of ways of thinking, talking and writing about music.  The majority of music dealt with is drawn from the so-called \"Classical\" repertory, from the medieval period to the present day, including some of the 'greats' such as Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Berlioz, and Verdi, but also introduces a student to unfamiliar music. This course explores the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon, considering what music has meant for different people, from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. Students listen to music and also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. \r\n\r\nStudents describe this course as interesting, enjoyable, and engaging. All students reviewed reported learning a lot and enjoying the course. One student felt that the course helped all students to \u201cdevelo[p] as experience music listeners, all while having an entertaining time in class.\u201d One student felt enlightened by the course\u2014others agreed, noting that they learned significant amounts about music from the last century\u2014although some students offered a critique that the course did not focus on technical aspects as much as it could have. \r\n\r\nAll students reported that Professor Dolan is an engaging and good teacher. According to one student, Professor Dolan is \u201cwonderful instructor, who is not only an engaging lecturer, but is totally willing to discuss music anytime, anywhere. Her passion for music shows in every aspect of the course.\u201d Students agreed that Professor Dolan was interesting, enthusiastic, passionate, and knowledgeable. \u201cI strongly believe that Professor Dolan is one of the finest at Penn,\u201d another student wrote. As another student explained, \u201cProfessor Dolan is great at presenting the information to students who have little musical background, and she excels at presenting it in a compelling way. I have little interest in music, but Professor Dolan was able to hold my interest the majority of the time. She is a great professor.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the course requires listening quizzes, listening responses, concert review, exams, and reading, many students felt the work could be significant, but worth it. As one student described it, \u201cThere are a lot of assignments, but I found most of them useful in terms of increasing the overall amount of learning I took away from the class.\u201d Students also agreed that the grading was extremely fair, one noting that the grading was distributed across the assignments so that no one assignment is worth more than 20-25%. Many students would recommend the course, even to students not interested in music.
