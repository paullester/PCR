{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2013"}, "description": "Participation in the course is contingent upon a successful audition. This course must be taken for a letter grade (pass/fail option may not be utilized for this course). This weekly seminar will explore music from the past and present through class discussions of performance and analytical aspects of the music led by a professor and/or performer. Compared to Music 236, this class will have a more analytical focus. Students will prepare for a final performance at the end of the semester as well as a paper/presentation. Students interested in this applied approach to music may also wish to take 236 and 256. \n\n", "semester": "2002C", "name": "INTRO TO ELECTRONIC MUS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/3281/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.69", "rDifficulty": "1.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "1.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.19", "rReadingsValue": "1.77", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.81", "rCommAbility": "2.56", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO ELECTRONIC MUS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MUSC-276-301", "path": "/courses/3281/sections/301", "id": "3281-301", "aliases": ["MUSC-276-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/3281/sections/301/reviews/855-JAMES-T-PRIMOSCH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/855-JAMES-T-PRIMOSCH", "first_name": "JAMES T", "last_name": "PRIMOSCH", "id": "855-JAMES-T-PRIMOSCH", "name": "JAMES T PRIMOSCH"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "3281-301-855-JAMES-T-PRIMOSCH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-276", "path": "/courses/3281", "sections": {"path": "/courses/3281/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO ELECTRONIC MUS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "MUSC-276-301", "path": "/courses/3281/sections/301", "id": "3281-301", "aliases": ["MUSC-276-301"]}]}, "id": 3281, "aliases": ["MUSC-276"]}
