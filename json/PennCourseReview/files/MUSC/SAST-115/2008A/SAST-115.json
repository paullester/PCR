{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4122"}, "description": "Hindustani and Karnatak music are among the great classical music systems of the world. Developed in temple, shrine, court, and concert stage environments in North and South India, they have a strong contemporary following in urban South Asia and a significant international presence. This course is an introduction to theory, structures, instruments, and aesthetics. We will work with primary and secondary texts, recordings, videos, and live performances. Topics will cover selected aspects of raga, tala, composition, improvisation and social contexts. The course aims to give students analytical and listening skills with which to approach and appreciate India's classical music. No prior music training is required. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "INDIA'S CLASSICAL MUSICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20815/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.94", "rDifficulty": "1.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "1.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.86", "rReadingsValue": "2.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.19", "rCommAbility": "3.69", "rInstructorQuality": "3.69"}, "section": {"name": "INDIA'S CLASSICAL MUSICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-115-401", "path": "/courses/20815/sections/401", "id": "20815-401", "aliases": ["SAST-115-401", "MUSC-164-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/20815/sections/401/reviews/849-ALLYN-MINER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/849-ALLYN-MINER", "first_name": "ALLYN", "last_name": "MINER", "id": "849-ALLYN-MINER", "name": "ALLYN MINER"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "20815-401-849-ALLYN-MINER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-115", "path": "/courses/20815", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20815/sections", "values": [{"name": "INDIA'S CLASSICAL MUSICS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-115-401", "path": "/courses/20815/sections/401", "id": "20815-401", "aliases": ["SAST-115-401", "MUSC-164-401"]}]}, "id": 20815, "aliases": ["SAST-115", "MUSC-164"]}
