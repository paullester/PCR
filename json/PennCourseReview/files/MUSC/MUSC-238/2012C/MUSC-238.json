{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5572"}, "description": "This course is designed to facilitate the sort of in-depth consideration of a musical work that can arise when the better part of a semester is given over essentially to the study of a single composition, in this case, Mahler's Second Symphony. The work will be studied from a variety of perspectives, including: the composer's approach to monumentality; his experiments with orchestral sonority; the influence on this symphony of Beethoven's Fifth and Ninth Symphonies; the relationship to the Second Symphony of Mahler's Lieder aus Des Knaben Wunderhorn and his own First Symphony; and the impact of events in Mahler's early life on the genesis and nature of the Resurrection Symphony. The course is open to Music Majors and Minors. Other students who believe they are adequately prepared for this course should consult with the instructor (Lawrence Bernstein) before registering. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "MAHLER'S  RESSURECTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29355/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.30", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rCourseQuality": "3.90", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "MAHLER'S  RESSURECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-238-001", "path": "/courses/29355/sections/001", "id": "29355-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-238-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/29355/sections/001/reviews/1632-LAWRENCE-F-BERNSTEIN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1632-LAWRENCE-F-BERNSTEIN", "first_name": "LAWRENCE F", "last_name": "BERNSTEIN", "id": "1632-LAWRENCE-F-BERNSTEIN", "name": "LAWRENCE F BERNSTEIN"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "29355-001-1632-LAWRENCE-F-BERNSTEIN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "MUSC-238", "path": "/courses/29355", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29355/sections", "values": [{"name": "MAHLER'S  RESSURECTION", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "MUSC-238-001", "path": "/courses/29355/sections/001", "id": "29355-001", "aliases": ["MUSC-238-001"]}]}, "id": 29355, "aliases": ["MUSC-238"]}
