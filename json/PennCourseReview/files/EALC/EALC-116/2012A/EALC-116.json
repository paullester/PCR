{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4218"}, "description": "Explore the beauty of gardens (and associated buildings) in Japan, China, and Korea from ancient times to the present. Lectures will be illustrated by photographs from dozens of sites in East Asia, and by a field trip to the Japanese House and Garden in Fairmount Park. The main body of the course will be a historical survey of the evolution of East Asian garden art forms from the sixth century to the present. Discussion will touch on geographic and climatic parameters, spiritual and aesthetic principles, practical limitations and creative innovations of East Asian gardens. There will be an additional fee for the Japanese House visit, and possibly for other field trips. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "EAST ASIAN GARDENS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27235/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "1.47", "rStimulateInterest": "2.35", "rRecommendMajor": "2.82", "rCourseQuality": "2.42", "rWorkRequired": "1.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "2.12", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.44", "rCommAbility": "2.76", "rInstructorQuality": "2.92"}, "section": {"name": "EAST ASIAN GARDENS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-116-401", "path": "/courses/27235/sections/401", "id": "27235-401", "aliases": ["EALC-116-401", "EALC-516-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 29, "path": "/courses/27235/sections/401/reviews/1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "first_name": "FRANK L.", "last_name": "CHANCE", "id": "1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "name": "FRANK L.
