{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3035"}, "description": "What does it mean to be a poet and a painter? How does being a visual artist link to being a literary person? Americans know the cultures of Asia through such romantic images as The Last Samurai, but few are familiar with the history of calligraphy, painting, prose and poetry which have dominated the cultural history of Asia. Using primary texts in translation, this course explores the complex relationship between poets and painters, intellectual creators and visual artists, over the history of China, Japan, and Korea, from the beginnings of the civil bureaucracy in China in the first century through the rise of women as literati artists in Japan. Students will develop analytic skills through discussion of written texts and painted representations; they will become familiar with a variety of visual artists and forms as well as with the broad sweep of East Asian history. Background inAsian language and culture is not required. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "LITERATI ARTS EAST ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17191/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.67", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.20", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "LITERATI ARTS EAST ASIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-114-401", "path": "/courses/17191/sections/401", "id": "17191-401", "aliases": ["EALC-114-401", "EALC-514-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/17191/sections/401/reviews/1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "first_name": "FRANK L.", "last_name": "CHANCE", "id": "1779-FRANK-L--CHANCE", "name": "FRANK L.
