Students will study various literary forms that emerged from this period as well as read several important works from that era. Novels include Journey to the West, Dream of the Red Chamber and The Plum in the Golden Vase.\r\nStudents found the course stimulating and for one student it even became a \u201cconstant topic of conversation\u201d with peers and family. The class was described as an \u201cacademic journey from ancient to present.\u201d Students warned that a lot of work was required for the class, including readings, several papers, oral reports, and two exams.\r\nStudents found Professor Mair to be one of the \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cmost interesting\u201d professors they have had at Penn. He was described as very knowledgeable about not only Chinese literature but also cultural and contemporary issues.\r\nThe course was highly recommended for even those who have no prior Chinese language skills or background. Students believed that they gained a greater interest in East Asian literature.", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/15562/sections/401/reviews/77-VICTOR-H--MAIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/77-VICTOR-H--MAIR", "first_name": "VICTOR H.", "last_name": "MAIR", "id": "77-VICTOR-H--MAIR", "name": "VICTOR H.
