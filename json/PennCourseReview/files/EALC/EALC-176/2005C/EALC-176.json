The course will conclude with a discussion of the legacy of the samurai in modern Japanese culture and the image of the samurai in foreign perceptions of Japan. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11640/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.22", "rDifficulty": "1.91", "rStimulateInterest": "2.47", "rRecommendMajor": "2.66", "rCourseQuality": "2.55", "rWorkRequired": "2.16", "rInstructorAccess": "2.69", "rReadingsValue": "2.10", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.31", "rCommAbility": "2.94", "rInstructorQuality": "2.97"}, "section": {"name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "EALC-176-601", "path": "/courses/11640/sections/601", "id": "11640-601", "aliases": ["EALC-176-601", "EALC-576-601", "HIST-276-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 47, "path": "/courses/11640/sections/601/reviews/70-G--CAMERON-HURST", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/70-G--CAMERON-HURST", "first_name": "G.
