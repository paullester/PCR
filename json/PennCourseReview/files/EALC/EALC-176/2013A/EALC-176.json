The course will conclude with a discussion of the legacy of the samurai in modern Japanese culture and the image of the samurai in foreign perceptions of Japan. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30133/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.29", "rTAQuality": "2.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rCourseQuality": "2.59", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.18", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorAccess": "2.82"}, "section": {"name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-176-401", "path": "/courses/30133/sections/401", "id": "30133-401", "aliases": ["EALC-176-401", "HIST-276-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 33, "path": "/courses/30133/sections/401/reviews/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "SPAFFORD", "id": "5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "name": "DAVID SPAFFORD"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "30133-401-5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-176", "path": "/courses/30133", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30133/sections", "values": [{"name": "JAPAN:AGE OF THE SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-176-401", "path": "/courses/30133/sections/401", "id": "30133-401", "aliases": ["EALC-176-401", "HIST-276-401"]}]}, "id": 30133, "aliases": ["EALC-176", "HIST-276"]}
