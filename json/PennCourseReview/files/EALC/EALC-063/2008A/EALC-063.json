{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4798"}, "description": "This seminar is in many ways an exercise in comparison-by looking at how the practice of medicine in Japan differs from that in America. Japan, where people enjoy good health and live very long lives, not only combines \"Western\" with \"Eastern\" medical practices but also is a place where questions of medical ethics and bio-technology are often faced differently than they are in America. The fact that in modern times many Japanese writers had medical educations makes Japanese literature, studied here in translation, a rich context for exploring a wide range of such questions. Film too will be a tool for our studies. A comparative look at what we might think about the body, the mind, and healing or dying processes will be the central focus of this seminar. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "MED,CULTR,BIOETHICS-JAPN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19991/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.38", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorAccess": "3.38", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.63", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "MED,CULTR,BIOETHICS-JAPN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "EALC-063-301", "path": "/courses/19991/sections/301", "id": "19991-301", "aliases": ["EALC-063-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/19991/sections/301/reviews/258-WILLIAM-R--LAFLEUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/258-WILLIAM-R--LAFLEUR", "first_name": "WILLIAM R.", "last_name": "LAFLEUR", "id": "258-WILLIAM-R--LAFLEUR", "name": "WILLIAM R.
