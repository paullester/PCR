By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times, students are able to explore in detail the religious institutions, artistic, architectural, and musical traditions, textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context.  Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions students are able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture.  The course concentrates first on the person of the Budda, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand.  From there the course touches on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time.  Finally, the course focuses on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West.  This section confronts the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as \"Just-War,\" Women's Rights and Abortion. While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, the course allows students to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara, Japan or Vientianne, Laos.\r\n\r\n\tStudents generally loved this class, with many calling it \u201cone of [their] favorite classes at Penn.\u201d Many found the subject matter \u201cextremely engaging and intellectually challenging,\u201d and called the course \u201cone of a kind.\u201d Though some didn\u2019t like how lectures were \u201clargely unstructured,\u201d most students \u201cthoroughly enjoyed every lecture\u201d and actively looked forward to coming to class.\r\n\r\n\tMuch of this stemmed from the teaching style of Professor McDaniel, who was called \u201coutstanding\u201d by his students.
