{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3044"}, "description": "The course will cover a number of social issues in Japan today. Since so much of postwar Japanese development has been based upon the nature of the relationship between the United States and Japan, we will begin with a consideration of the occupation of Japan as the crucible in which the partnership was formed and basic agreements reached. We will examine the nature of the Japanese political economy, both the extraordinary growth of the economy until the late 1980s and its post-cold war stagnation. Among the social issues we will examine are ethnic consciousness, marriage and the family, work and gender roles, school and education. We will conclude with a consideration of Japan's imperialist role in the prewar and wartime era. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "CONTEMP JAPANESE SOCIETY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/20004/reviews", "values": []}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-279", "path": "/courses/20004", "sections": {"path": "/courses/20004/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONTEMP JAPANESE SOCIETY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-279-401", "path": "/courses/20004/sections/401", "id": "20004-401", "aliases": ["EALC-279-401", "EALC-679-401"]}]}, "id": 20004, "aliases": ["EALC-279", "EALC-679"]}
