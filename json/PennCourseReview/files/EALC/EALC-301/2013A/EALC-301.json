Topic for spring 2013 Chinese Archaeology This course examines the foundations of Chinese civilization from an archaeological perspective. Excavation and research over the last 100 years has produced a revolution in understanding of the Chinese past, one which has both affirmed and unsettled traditional views. Topics covered include the emergence of early states, cities and economies; technology; the beginnings of writing; ritual and religions; death and burial; and the production and consumption of art objects and luxury goods among the elite. The course readings will be in English. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "MAJOR SEMINAR ON CHINA: CHINESE ARCHAEOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30138/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rCourseQuality": "2.78", "rWorkRequired": "2.44", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "MAJOR SEMINAR ON CHINA: CHINESE ARCHAEOLOGY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "EALC-301-301", "path": "/courses/30138/sections/301", "id": "30138-301", "aliases": ["EALC-301-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/30138/sections/301/reviews/6479-ADAM-D--SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6479-ADAM-D--SMITH", "first_name": "ADAM D.", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "6479-ADAM-D--SMITH", "name": "ADAM D.
