It is an introductory course on Japanese civilization, usually required or recommended for such higher-level courses as EALC263, \u2018Topics in Japanese Thought.\u2019\r\nStudents described the course to be \u201cvery well planned out and balanced in terms of time periods and notable figures.\u201d However, covering such a vast period in only one semester actually limited the course, causing students to feel like they were just \u201cskimming the surface\u201d rather than truly understanding the topics in greater depth. Students commented that the lectures did not contain enough material and that the professor relied more on the readings.\r\nProfessor Kano was described as the \u201cgreatest\u201d at making Japanese culture and history very comprehensive. Students stated that they enjoyed Professor Kano\u2019s stories for these helped them understand what was going on during each period.\r\nBecause the course does not greatly analyze the history of each period, it was recommended for students who have little to no knowledge of Japanese culture. Students further commented that the readings were not too difficult or overwhelming, and allowed them to read and think more about the topics discussed.", "num_students": 66, "path": "/courses/15560/sections/001/reviews/51-AYAKO-KANO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/51-AYAKO-KANO", "first_name": "AYAKO", "last_name": "KANO", "id": "51-AYAKO-KANO", "name": "AYAKO KANO"}, "num_reviewers": 60, "id": "15560-001-51-AYAKO-KANO"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-002", "path": "/courses/15560", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15560/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO TO JAPANESE CIVIL", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EALC-002-001", "path": "/courses/15560/sections/001", "id": "15560-001", "aliases": ["EALC-002-001"]}]}, "id": 15560, "aliases": ["EALC-002"]}
