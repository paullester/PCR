A lot of students reported learning a lot from the course, although some expressed discontent with the material learned. For example, one student said the course focused too much on \u201clearning about differing approaches of studying the history\u201d rather that studying the history itself. \r\n\r\nStudents were overall unhappy with the quality of Professor Horiguchi\u2019s lecturing. Although many noted that he was undoubtedly \u201cvery qualified,\u201d they also said that he needed to work on making the lectures more comprehensible. \r\n\r\nStudents also noted that the recitation for this class was very helpful. Many also said that there was a lot of reading required for the course.
