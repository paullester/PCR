{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5319"}, "description": "In this course we will examine the historical construction of samurai identity i.e., the ways in which the identity of samurai as warriors-turned-bureaucrats was created during the peaceful Tokugawa years (1600-1868) by samurai themselves, as well as how that identity was crafted subsequently by others in Japan and abroad. Our texts will include autobiography, warrior codes, writings on the way of the warrior (bushido), short stories and film as well as ritual remembrances. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "CONSTRUCTING THE SAMURAI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25865/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "2.60", "rStimulateInterest": "2.30", "rRecommendMajor": "2.80", "rCourseQuality": "2.36", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "2.90", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.30", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.64"}, "section": {"name": "CONSTRUCTING THE SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-177-401", "path": "/courses/25865/sections/401", "id": "25865-401", "aliases": ["EALC-177-401", "EALC-577-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/25865/sections/401/reviews/5985-CONSTANTINE-VAPORIS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5985-CONSTANTINE-VAPORIS", "first_name": "CONSTANTINE", "last_name": "VAPORIS", "id": "5985-CONSTANTINE-VAPORIS", "name": "CONSTANTINE VAPORIS"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "25865-401-5985-CONSTANTINE-VAPORIS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-177", "path": "/courses/25865", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25865/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONSTRUCTING THE SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-177-401", "path": "/courses/25865/sections/401", "id": "25865-401", "aliases": ["EALC-177-401", "EALC-577-401"]}]}, "id": 25865, "aliases": ["EALC-177", "EALC-577"]}
