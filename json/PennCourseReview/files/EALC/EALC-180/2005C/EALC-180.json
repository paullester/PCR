{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3730"}, "description": "This course surveys the history of Korean literature from the warring periods when the three kingdoms were each vying for dominance on the peninsula to the end of the long Choson dynasty in the 19th century. Students will be introduced to the major authors, works and genres, as well as important historical figures and events in order to examine the development of Korean literature and culture during these periods of turbulence and peace. Some of the topics we will explore are: literati versus folk culture; identity and language; gender and class relations; and the intersection between history and literature. We will explore these issues through various texts and other media representations, such as film and historical television dramas. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "PRE-MODERN KOREAN LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11641/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "PRE-MODERN KOREAN LIT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EALC-180-001", "path": "/courses/11641/sections/001", "id": "11641-001", "aliases": ["EALC-180-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/11641/sections/001/reviews/2396-JINA-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2396-JINA-KIM", "first_name": "JINA", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "2396-JINA-KIM", "name": "JINA KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "11641-001-2396-JINA-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-180", "path": "/courses/11641", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11641/sections", "values": [{"name": "PRE-MODERN KOREAN LIT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "EALC-180-001", "path": "/courses/11641/sections/001", "id": "11641-001", "aliases": ["EALC-180-001"]}]}, "id": 11641, "aliases": ["EALC-180"]}
