{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5207"}, "description": "In popular imagination, premodern Japan has long been associated with its hereditary warrior class, the samurai. Countless movies (recently the appalling Last Samurai ) have explored the character and martial prowess of these men. Yet warriors constituted but a tiny portion of the societies they inhabited and ruled, and historians researching medieval Japan have turned their attentions to a great range of subjects and to other classes (elite and commoner alike). This seminar is designed to acquaint students with the challenge of researching the broader world of medieval Japan (ca. 1110-1600). In the course of the semester, through a broad range of readings of primary sources (in translation) and modern English-language scholarship, students will be introduced to the peculiarities (limitations and opportunities) of research in premodern history. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "SAMURAI MEDIEVAL JAPAN: Samurai, Peasants, & Monks in Medieval Japan", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24247/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SAMURAI MEDIEVAL JAPAN: Samurai, Peasants, & Monks in Medieval Japan", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-276-401", "path": "/courses/24247/sections/401", "id": "24247-401", "aliases": ["EALC-276-401", "EALC-676-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/24247/sections/401/reviews/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "SPAFFORD", "id": "5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "name": "DAVID SPAFFORD"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "24247-401-5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-276", "path": "/courses/24247", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24247/sections", "values": [{"name": "SAMURAI MEDIEVAL JAPAN: Samurai, Peasants, & Monks in Medieval Japan", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-276-401", "path": "/courses/24247/sections/401", "id": "24247-401", "aliases": ["EALC-276-401", "EALC-676-401"]}]}, "id": 24247, "aliases": ["EALC-276", "EALC-676"]}
