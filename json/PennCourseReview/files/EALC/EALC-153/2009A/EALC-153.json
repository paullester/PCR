{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4221"}, "description": "From the earliest literature to the latest think piece on Japanese society, the roles of the \"warrior\" and of \"loyalty\" in Japanese culture have fascinated those both inside and outside of Japan. In this course we will trace the development of paragons of loyalty and warrior prowess from the earliest literary works, through the epic Tales of the Heike, and on to the \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers,\" theater, and film. We will read in the philosophy of fidelity and samurai codes to track the growing dedication to ideals of loyalty, exploring evidence of behavior less than loyal as we seek the real influence of these notions. Related topics include the extremes of vengeance and fanaticism. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "LOYAL WARRIORS JAPAN LIT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15566/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.65", "rDifficulty": "2.24", "rStimulateInterest": "3.24", "rRecommendMajor": "3.12", "rCourseQuality": "2.79", "rWorkRequired": "2.47", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.94", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.65", "rCommAbility": "3.53", "rInstructorQuality": "3.37"}, "section": {"name": "LOYAL WARRIORS JAPAN LIT", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-153-401", "path": "/courses/15566/sections/401", "id": "15566-401", "aliases": ["EALC-153-401", "EALC-553-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/15566/sections/401/reviews/1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "first_name": "LINDA H.", "last_name": "CHANCE", "id": "1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "name": "LINDA H.
