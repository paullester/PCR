{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5410"}, "description": "This course tackles about a millennium of pre-modern Japanese political, social, and cultural history (roughly, 700-1700). Instead of attempting to cover the period chronologically, as an introductory survey might, this class is structured as a series of case studies. Each of these will take a primary source as its point of departure and explore one or more facets of Japanese history and writing. In the course of each case study, lectures and discussions will branch out from the main source to examine its historical context as well as the (political, cultural, textual) traditions that informed that source s composition. In general, students will read the entire texts of the main sources (or significant portions of them), along with scholarly articles and shorter excerpts from other sources, composed at the same time or in the same vein/genre. During lectures and discussions alike, students will be asked to engage the readings, so as to grasp the specifics of Japanese history and practice the analytical skills required of historical discourse. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SHAMANS TO SAMURAI", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27241/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.13", "rCourseQuality": "2.44", "rWorkRequired": "2.53", "rInstructorAccess": "3.07", "rReadingsValue": "3.07", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.93", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "2.89"}, "section": {"name": "SHAMANS TO SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-270-401", "path": "/courses/27241/sections/401", "id": "27241-401", "aliases": ["EALC-270-401", "HIST-277-401", "EALC-670-401"]}, "comments": "This course tackles about a millennium of pre-modern Japanese political, social, and cultural history (roughly, 700-1700).

Students considered the class a success \u201cthematically,\u201d but less so in providing an \u201cauthoritative history.\u201d  In particular, the emphasis on primary texts left many students feeling uncertain about \u201cfactual historical details.\u201d  Nonetheless, students found class discussions and readings \u201cinteresting.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents greatly appreciated Professor Spafford\u2019s passion for his subject matter.  He was described as a \u201cthoughtful professor\u201d and his knowledge of the material was praised as \u201cencyclopedic.\u201d  Participants particularly valued his \u201cgenuine desire to convey his knowledge\u201d on Japanese history, rather than forcing students to memorize the material.  He was also perceived as approachable and \u201cfriendly.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe course workload was generally reviewed as \u201cfair,\u201d however students noted that the readings were \u201cconsiderably too long to complete.\u201d  Assignments were manageable, especially because Professor Spafford was \u201ceasygoing and flexible with deadlines.\u201d  Most students enrolled in the course because it related to their broader course of study, although a few noted that it \u201cturned them on to the topic of Japanese history.\u201d", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/27241/sections/401/reviews/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "SPAFFORD", "id": "5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "name": "DAVID SPAFFORD"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "27241-401-5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-270", "path": "/courses/27241", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27241/sections", "values": [{"name": "SHAMANS TO SAMURAI", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-270-401", "path": "/courses/27241/sections/401", "id": "27241-401", "aliases": ["EALC-270-401", "HIST-277-401", "EALC-670-401"]}]}, "id": 27241, "aliases": ["EALC-270", "HIST-277", "EALC-670"]}
