{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3038"}, "description": "This course explores literature's relationship to both domestic and international politics. We will examine this relationship through the various cultural institutions that have been set up to facilitate the creation of \"National Literature.\" What doe sit mean to win a literary award, especially the Nobel Prize in Literature? What is the significance of literary awards to writers, readers, and publishers? And in the case of the Nobel, what does it mean for the country of the author's origin? We will attempt to understand the institutionalization and internationalization of Korean literature in the postwar (post 1945) era where much efforts have been put into producing a Korean Nobel Laureate in literature. Through our critical reading of contemporary Korean novels and poetry, we will examine the various ways in which certain literature becomes established as part of a nation's identity to be presented to the international community. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "POLITICS OF KOREAN LIT: Politics of Literature: Postwar Korean Literature", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7542/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "4.00", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "4.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "POLITICS OF KOREAN LIT: Politics of Literature: Postwar Korean Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-196-401", "path": "/courses/7542/sections/401", "id": "7542-401", "aliases": ["EALC-196-401", "EALC-596-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 2, "path": "/courses/7542/sections/401/reviews/2396-JINA-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2396-JINA-KIM", "first_name": "JINA", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "2396-JINA-KIM", "name": "JINA KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 1, "id": "7542-401-2396-JINA-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-196", "path": "/courses/7542", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7542/sections", "values": [{"name": "POLITICS OF KOREAN LIT: Politics of Literature: Postwar Korean Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-196-401", "path": "/courses/7542/sections/401", "id": "7542-401", "aliases": ["EALC-196-401", "EALC-596-401"]}]}, "id": 7542, "aliases": ["EALC-196", "EALC-596"]}
