{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3342"}, "description": "This course examines representations of sexuality and sexual experience in the confines of Japanese urban space as it transforms from the late 19th century through the 1930s. Students will explore the creation of modern Japanese subjects in literature and visual culture as these confront a complex and conflicted modernity and new political, social, and cultural demands on sex. From the vestiges of licensed prostitution to the transgressive behavior known as \"erotic, grotesque, nonsense,\" sexual encounter takes on different meaning. All the readings will be in English translation, but Japanese originals can be made available on request. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "SEX & TERROR MOD JAPAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27237/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.75", "rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.20", "rWorkRequired": "2.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.80"}, "section": {"name": "SEX & TERROR MOD JAPAN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-154-401", "path": "/courses/27237/sections/401", "id": "27237-401", "aliases": ["EALC-154-401", "EALC-554-401", "GSWS-554-401", "GSWS-154-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/27237/sections/401/reviews/6081-LESLIE-WINSTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6081-LESLIE-WINSTON", "first_name": "LESLIE", "last_name": "WINSTON", "id": "6081-LESLIE-WINSTON", "name": "LESLIE WINSTON"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "27237-401-6081-LESLIE-WINSTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-154", "path": "/courses/27237", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27237/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEX & TERROR MOD JAPAN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-154-401", "path": "/courses/27237/sections/401", "id": "27237-401", "aliases": ["EALC-154-401", "EALC-554-401", "GSWS-554-401", "GSWS-154-401"]}]}, "id": 27237, "aliases": ["EALC-154", "EALC-554", "GSWS-554", "GSWS-154"]}
