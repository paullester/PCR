{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4220"}, "description": "The Song Dynasty (960-1279) witnessed social, economic, technological, cultural, and intellectual transformations that shaped the contours of Chinese society for centuries to come. At the same time, however, an equally dramatic process of change and state-formation among the once-nomadic polities of the steppe pressed Song China ever-more tightly, finally burying it under the force of the world-conquering empire of the Mongol Yuan. After surveying the rise and fall of the Song Dynasty in the context of the multi-state system of the mid-imperial era, we will focus in more detail on selected aspects of Chinese society during the Song, including the emergence of an exuberant urban culture, the rise to dominance of the examination-based literatus-gentry class, the contested ascent of Neo-Confucianism, the emergence of the patrilineal lineage system, and the consequences of all of these developments for the mid- and late-imperial gender order. Readings in the scholarly literature will be supplemented by primary sources in translation and, for graduate students, in the original Chinese. \n\n", "semester": "2009A", "name": "SONG DYNASTY HISTORY: Transformations of Mid-Imperial China: Topics & Sources Song Dynasty Hist", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/15565/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "2.88", "rStimulateInterest": "2.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.13", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.75", "rCommAbility": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "SONG DYNASTY HISTORY: Transformations of Mid-Imperial China: Topics & Sources Song Dynasty Hist", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-143-401", "path": "/courses/15565/sections/401", "id": "15565-401", "aliases": ["EALC-143-401", "EALC-543-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 13, "path": "/courses/15565/sections/401/reviews/4293-PAUL-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4293-PAUL-SMITH", "first_name": "PAUL", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "4293-PAUL-SMITH", "name": "PAUL SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "15565-401-4293-PAUL-SMITH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-143", "path": "/courses/15565", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15565/sections", "values": [{"name": "SONG DYNASTY HISTORY: Transformations of Mid-Imperial China: Topics & Sources Song Dynasty Hist", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-143-401", "path": "/courses/15565/sections/401", "id": "15565-401", "aliases": ["EALC-143-401", "EALC-543-401"]}]}, "id": 15565, "aliases": ["EALC-143", "EALC-543"]}
