How to define the age of the modern in China? From the May Fourth New Cultural Movement to the 1949 great divide, what shaped the topography of modern Chinese literature? This course reconsiders the project of Chinese literary modernization from the vantage point of the 1949 Cold War division. Key issues examined include revolution and involution, enlightenment and decadence, poetics and politics, migration and dislocation, loyalism, betrayal and the captive mind, the aesthetics of desolation and erotica, death and transformation, gender and violence, etc. Great importance is placed on class discussion and on creating a dialogue of interpretations of the texts being studied. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "ENLIGHT/DECAD CHIN LIT: Enlightenment/Decadence in Modern Chinese Literature", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/18512/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.09", "rDifficulty": "2.55", "rStimulateInterest": "3.18", "rRecommendMajor": "3.10", "rCourseQuality": "3.45", "rWorkRequired": "2.73", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "3.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.27", "rCommAbility": "3.55", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "ENLIGHT/DECAD CHIN LIT: Enlightenment/Decadence in Modern Chinese Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-231-401", "path": "/courses/18512/sections/401", "id": "18512-401", "aliases": ["EALC-231-401", "EALC-631-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/18512/sections/401/reviews/3929-XIAOJUE-WANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3929-XIAOJUE-WANG", "first_name": "XIAOJUE", "last_name": "WANG", "id": "3929-XIAOJUE-WANG", "name": "XIAOJUE WANG"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "18512-401-3929-XIAOJUE-WANG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-231", "path": "/courses/18512", "sections": {"path": "/courses/18512/sections", "values": [{"name": "ENLIGHT/DECAD CHIN LIT: Enlightenment/Decadence in Modern Chinese Literature", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-231-401", "path": "/courses/18512/sections/401", "id": "18512-401", "aliases": ["EALC-231-401", "EALC-631-401"]}]}, "id": 18512, "aliases": ["EALC-231", "EALC-631"]}
