{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3036"}, "description": "In this course we will examine the socio-economic and cultural factors which gave rise to a rich diversity of religions in Inner Asia, specifically along what has come to be known as the Silk Road. From the late Bronze age to the rise and fall of the Mongol Empire, an axis of regular trade and communication existed between western and eastern Asia allowing for a number of religious traditions to flourish and interact: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Manichaeismm, Nestorian Christianity, and Islam. Although focusing on Buddhism, we will approach all these traditions and their development through reading a variety of their classic and/or sacred texts, supplementing these with lectures and secondary studies. To broaden our understanding of the role of non-textual material in the development of religions along the Silk Road, we will also focus on the wealth of non-literate religious expression, such as art, ritual, and iconography. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "RELIGION ON SILK ROAD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7540/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.38", "rDifficulty": "3.38", "rStimulateInterest": "3.13", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.38", "rCommAbility": "3.13", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "RELIGION ON SILK ROAD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-137-401", "path": "/courses/7540/sections/401", "id": "7540-401", "aliases": ["EALC-137-401", "RELS-187-401", "EALC-537-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/7540/sections/401/reviews/2915-DAVID-N--SCHMID", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2915-DAVID-N--SCHMID", "first_name": "DAVID N.", "last_name": "SCHMID", "id": "2915-DAVID-N--SCHMID", "name": "DAVID N.
