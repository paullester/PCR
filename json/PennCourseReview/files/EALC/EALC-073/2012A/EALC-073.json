{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5409"}, "description": "How do we study a pre-modern, non-European society? This course is designed to introduce students to the challenges and rewards of conducting historical research in contexts far removed from our own, where sources can be endlessly fascinating but can also seem forbidding at first. We shall focus in particular on Japan's \"Long Sixteenth Century\" (circa 1467-1615), a time of great military turmoil but also of extraordinary social ferment and cultural innovation. In order to consider the many facets of the period, the seminar will be strongly interdisciplinary and will alternate between discussion of important historiographical and methodological concerns, as revealed in the work of modern scholars, and hands-on analysis and interpretation of a wide range of primary sources, both published and unpublished. (All primary sources will be read in translation; all written assignments will be based on material discussed in class.) \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "CULTURE/CONFLICT JAPAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27234/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.50", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.50", "rRecommendMajor": "2.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.17", "rReadingsValue": "2.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.17"}, "section": {"name": "CULTURE/CONFLICT JAPAN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-073-401", "path": "/courses/27234/sections/401", "id": "27234-401", "aliases": ["EALC-073-401", "HIST-105-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/27234/sections/401/reviews/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "first_name": "DAVID", "last_name": "SPAFFORD", "id": "5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD", "name": "DAVID SPAFFORD"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "27234-401-5733-DAVID-SPAFFORD"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-073", "path": "/courses/27234", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27234/sections", "values": [{"name": "CULTURE/CONFLICT JAPAN", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-073-401", "path": "/courses/27234/sections/401", "id": "27234-401", "aliases": ["EALC-073-401", "HIST-105-401"]}]}, "id": 27234, "aliases": ["EALC-073", "HIST-105"]}
