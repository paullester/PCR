{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/928"}, "description": "This course examines the politics and policies of contemporary Japan, applying a range of theoretical perspectives to analyze both recent history and current events. We will survey the core political institutions of the postwar era, examine patterns of political interaction, and investigate current debates over policy. The 1990s have been marked by political change at many different levels in Japan and the course will investigate the significance of these changes, as well as enduring continuities. Recent changes have included the introduction of a new electoral system, shift from one party rule to coalition government rule, breaking the bureaucracy, a financial crisis and prolonged economic stagnation. In the latter part of the course, we will focus in particular on the puzzle of how Japan's political economic structures and policies could have proven so successful for so long and yest so distastrous of late. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think about Japanese politics in a comparative context and to consider the functioning of the Japanese political system in the context of more theoretical debates in political science. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "JAPANESE POLITICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/928/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.22", "rDifficulty": "2.89", "rStimulateInterest": "2.56", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "3.18", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.06", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.28", "rCommAbility": "3.24", "rInstructorQuality": "3.22"}, "section": {"name": "JAPANESE POLITICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "PSCI-212-001", "path": "/courses/928/sections/001", "id": "928-001", "aliases": ["PSCI-212-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 22, "path": "/courses/928/sections/001/reviews/1001-JENNIFER-A--AMYX", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1001-JENNIFER-A--AMYX", "first_name": "JENNIFER A.", "last_name": "AMYX", "id": "1001-JENNIFER-A--AMYX", "name": "JENNIFER A.
