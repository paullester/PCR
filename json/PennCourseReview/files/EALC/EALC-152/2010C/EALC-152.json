{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3341"}, "description": "How do people make sense of the multiple experiences that the simple words \"love\" and \"loss imply? How do they express their thoughts and feelings to one another? In this course, we will explore some means Japanese culture has found to grapple with these events and sensations. We will also see how these culturally sanctioned frameworks have shaped the ways Japanese view love and loss. Our materials will sample the literary tradition of Japan from earliest times to the early modern periods. Close readings of a diverse group of texts, including poetry, narrative, theater, and the related arts of calligraphy, painting, and music will structure our inquiry. By the end of the course, you should be able to appreciate texts that differ significantly in their value systems, linguistic expressions, and aesthetic sensibilities from those that you may already know. All material is in English translation. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "LOVE&LOSS:JPNS LIT TRAD", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22896/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.64", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.14", "rRecommendMajor": "3.43", "rCourseQuality": "2.88", "rWorkRequired": "2.23", "rInstructorAccess": "3.64", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.92", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "LOVE&LOSS:JPNS LIT TRAD", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-152-401", "path": "/courses/22896/sections/401", "id": "22896-401", "aliases": ["EALC-152-401", "EALC-552-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/22896/sections/401/reviews/1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "first_name": "LINDA H.", "last_name": "CHANCE", "id": "1234-LINDA-H--CHANCE", "name": "LINDA H.
