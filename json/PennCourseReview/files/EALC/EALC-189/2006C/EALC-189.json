{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3343"}, "description": "This course will focus on the reading of Korean literature and criticism in translation. We will investigate the \"materialization\" of modern urban literature in Colonial Korea and ask what kinds of historical, cultural and gender shifts occurred as a result of modern material objects and spatial practices. How did the new urban geographical spatial practices shape the space of language and literature and vice versa? How can we start to theorize about the burgeoning genre of \"urban\" literature in colonial Korea and what does this mean for the development of literary modernity/modernism in Korea? It is recommended that graduate students have reading knowledge of Korean and may benefit from reading some of the texts in the original Korean and engage in a more substantial research project using primary sources. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "URBN NARR COLONIAL KOREA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/8744/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.33", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "URBN NARR COLONIAL KOREA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-189-401", "path": "/courses/8744/sections/401", "id": "8744-401", "aliases": ["EALC-189-401", "URBS-289-401", "EALC-589-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/8744/sections/401/reviews/2396-JINA-KIM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2396-JINA-KIM", "first_name": "JINA", "last_name": "KIM", "id": "2396-JINA-KIM", "name": "JINA KIM"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "8744-401-2396-JINA-KIM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "EALC-189", "path": "/courses/8744", "sections": {"path": "/courses/8744/sections", "values": [{"name": "URBN NARR COLONIAL KOREA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-189-401", "path": "/courses/8744/sections/401", "id": "8744-401", "aliases": ["EALC-189-401", "URBS-289-401", "EALC-589-401"]}]}, "id": 8744, "aliases": ["EALC-189", "URBS-289", "EALC-589"]}
