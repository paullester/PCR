Students analyze the poetics and aesthetics of the Japanese popular music used as opening and ending theme songs for anime and live-action dramas. The curriculum considers the distinct features of each genre and medium of stories such as \u201cMoribito: Guardian of the Spirit\u201d and \u201cFullmetal Alchemist.\u201d\r\nStudents commented that this course was \u201cone of the most provoking classes\u201d at Penn. The students enjoyed the fact that the material related to not only Japanese culture but also music, literature, anthropology, and even marketing. Readings were valuable and insightful, but some students found that not enough class time was spent discussing the readings. However, the class was thought to be \u201cacademically rigorous and intellectually stimulating.\u201d\r\nAccording to students, Professor Harrington\u2019s willingness to discuss contents out of the class was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Students claiming that Professor Harrington was their \u201cfavorite teacher at Penn\u201d stated that he was \u201ctruly passionate about his subject matter.\u201d\r\nThe pre-requisites for this class include either EALC 002 or EALC 069. Students may also seek permission from the instructor. Because the course covers such a wide variety of topics, students recommended this class to anyone interested in Japanese culture.", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/15568/sections/401/reviews/2043-LEWIS-E-HARRINGTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2043-LEWIS-E-HARRINGTON", "first_name": "LEWIS E", "last_name": "HARRINGTON", "id": "2043-LEWIS-E-HARRINGTON", "name": "LEWIS E HARRINGTON"}, "num_reviewers": 25, "id": "15568-401-2043-LEWIS-E-HARRINGTON"}]
