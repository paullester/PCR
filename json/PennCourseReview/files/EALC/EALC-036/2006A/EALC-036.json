{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3034"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to Chinese religions from antiquity to the present. Paying particular attention to both the distinction and interaction between popular and elite religious traditions, we will examine the chronological development of dominant themes and tropes such as: Shamanism; Death and the afterlife; Family and ancestor worship; Personal welfare and its relation to mantic knowledge; Religious aspects of imperial authority and bureaucracy. Moving beyond textual representations of belief and practice, the course will, in addition, examine in-depth a variety of ritual objects and artistic expressions of these thematic elements of each tradition. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "POPULAR RELIGION/CHINA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7538/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.67", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "POPULAR RELIGION/CHINA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "EALC-036-401", "path": "/courses/7538/sections/401", "id": "7538-401", "aliases": ["EALC-036-401", "RELS-086-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/7538/sections/401/reviews/2915-DAVID-N--SCHMID", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2915-DAVID-N--SCHMID", "first_name": "DAVID N.", "last_name": "SCHMID", "id": "2915-DAVID-N--SCHMID", "name": "DAVID N.
