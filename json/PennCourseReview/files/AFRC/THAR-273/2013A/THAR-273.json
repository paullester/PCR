{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3252"}, "description": "From Plautus to Ionesco, dark comedies explore concepts and ideas seemingly at odds with comic traditions and structures they employ. This class uses the the study of theory, history, plays and theatrical technique to explore the significance and effect of tragicomedies. Students will acquire an understanding of the genre's unique characteristics through textual and practical work and through viewing pertinent films. In addition to reading and discussing plays and critcism, students will be required to perform a scene from a tragicomic play, experimenting with and creating tragicomic effect through performance. This course will be roughly organized into three sections: historic precedents (Plautus, Shakespeare, Moliere), 19th century transitional dramas (Chekhov, Isben) and 20th century tragicomedies, in which the bulk of the course readings will be done (Beckett, Ionesco, Pinter, Stoppard, Henley, etc.). \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "DARK COMEDY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31086/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.13", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.81", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "2.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.12", "rCommAbility": "3.31", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "DARK COMEDY", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-273-402", "path": "/courses/31086/sections/402", "id": "31086-402", "aliases": ["THAR-273-402", "CINE-225-402", "ENGL-292-402"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 20, "path": "/courses/31086/sections/402/reviews/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "first_name": "MARCIA", "last_name": "FERGUSON", "id": "1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON", "name": "MARCIA FERGUSON"}, "num_reviewers": 19, "id": "31086-402-1187-MARCIA-FERGUSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "THAR-273", "path": "/courses/31086", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31086/sections", "values": [{"name": "DARK COMEDY", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "THAR-273-402", "path": "/courses/31086/sections/402", "id": "31086-402", "aliases": ["THAR-273-402", "CINE-225-402", "ENGL-292-402"]}]}, "id": 31086, "aliases": ["THAR-273", "CINE-225", "ENGL-292"]}
