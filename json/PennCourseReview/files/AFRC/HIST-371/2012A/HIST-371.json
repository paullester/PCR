{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4819"}, "description": "This seminar will explore the historical relationship between these two regions from the early modern age to the present. We will examine the history of trade, particularly the slave trade, and its cultural and political legacy. We will compare the experiences of European imperalism--how the scramble for Africa dovetailed with the last decades of the Ottoman Empire--with an eye to how this shaped nationalist movements in both regions. The course will also explore the decades of independence with a special eye towards pan-Africanism and pan-Arabism. We will also study the ramifications of the Arab-Israeli conflict on the relationship between African and Middle-Eastern countries, from Uganda to Ethiopia, from OPEC to Darfur. The course will pay close attention to migrations through the regions, whether forced or economic or religious. Whenever possible we will explore, through film and literature, how people in Africa and the Middle East see their connections, and their differences. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "AFRICA & THE MID-EAST", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27587/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.73", "rDifficulty": "2.73", "rStimulateInterest": "3.09", "rRecommendMajor": "2.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.27", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.82", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.91", "rCommAbility": "3.27", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "AFRICA & THE MID-EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-371-401", "path": "/courses/27587/sections/401", "id": "27587-401", "aliases": ["HIST-371-401", "NELC-334-401", "AFST-373-401", "AFRC-372-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/27587/sections/401/reviews/3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL", "first_name": "EVE", "last_name": "TROUTT POWELL", "id": "3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL", "name": "EVE TROUTT POWELL"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "27587-401-3326-EVE-TROUTT-POWELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-371", "path": "/courses/27587", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27587/sections", "values": [{"name": "AFRICA & THE MID-EAST", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-371-401", "path": "/courses/27587/sections/401", "id": "27587-401", "aliases": ["HIST-371-401", "NELC-334-401", "AFST-373-401", "AFRC-372-401"]}]}, "id": 27587, "aliases": ["HIST-371", "NELC-334", "AFST-373", "AFRC-372"]}
