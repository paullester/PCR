{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/1058"}, "description": "The purpose of this course is to guide senior sociology majors in writing a research proposal for a senior honors thesis. Students will learn about various research approaches, how to write a focused literature review, and kinds of data necessary to answer a wide variety of research questions, including their own. Throughout the course, students will work on designing a research question, generation researchable hypotheses, and coming up with a design for their proposed study. The final paper for this course will be a research proposal that is the basis for students' independent research project. This course satisfies the research requirement for sociology majors and is designed primarily for seniors who are planning to write an honors thesis. \n\n", "semester": "2005C", "name": "SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINAR: THESIS WORKSHOP", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12441/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.91", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "2.91", "rRecommendMajor": "3.18", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.73", "rReadingsValue": "1.91", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.45", "rCommAbility": "3.09", "rInstructorQuality": "3.27"}, "section": {"name": "SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINAR: THESIS WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SOCI-300-301", "path": "/courses/12441/sections/301", "id": "12441-301", "aliases": ["SOCI-300-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 11, "path": "/courses/12441/sections/301/reviews/1094-ROBIN-LISA-LEIDNER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1094-ROBIN-LISA-LEIDNER", "first_name": "ROBIN LISA", "last_name": "LEIDNER", "id": "1094-ROBIN-LISA-LEIDNER", "name": "ROBIN LISA LEIDNER"}, "num_reviewers": 11, "id": "12441-301-1094-ROBIN-LISA-LEIDNER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rRecommendMajor": "3.75", "rCourseQuality": "3.08", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.58", "rReadingsValue": "2.67", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.80", "rCommAbility": "3.25", "rInstructorQuality": "3.42"}, "section": {"name": "SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINAR: Concept-Driven Workshop", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "SOCI-300-302", "path": "/courses/12441/sections/302", "id": "12441-302", "aliases": ["SOCI-300-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/12441/sections/302/reviews/2689-TIMOTHY-J-NELSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2689-TIMOTHY-J-NELSON", "first_name": "TIMOTHY J", "last_name": "NELSON", "id": "2689-TIMOTHY-J-NELSON", "name": "TIMOTHY J NELSON"}, "num_reviewers": 12, "id": "12441-302-2689-TIMOTHY-J-NELSON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-300", "path": "/courses/12441", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12441/sections", "values": [{"name": "SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINAR: THESIS WORKSHOP", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SOCI-300-301", "path": "/courses/12441/sections/301", "id": "12441-301", "aliases": ["SOCI-300-301"]}, {"name": "SENIOR RESEARCH SEMINAR: Concept-Driven Workshop", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "SOCI-300-302", "path": "/courses/12441/sections/302", "id": "12441-302", "aliases": ["SOCI-300-302"]}]}, "id": 12441, "aliases": ["SOCI-300"]}
