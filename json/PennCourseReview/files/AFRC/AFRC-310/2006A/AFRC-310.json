{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2939"}, "description": "Knowledge of self is the key to understanding, and ultimately wisdom. But what is self? An African-centered perspective defines self as the collective, for \"I Am Because We Are.\" However, America has historically promoted the individualistic \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, thus we are left with the question of what Africans in America are supposed to believe, and how does this quandry influence our individual and collective identities. Part 1 of the course will focus on identity issues, from how we view ourselves to how our identities change in relationships (family, social). A heavy emphasis will be placed on an African-centered paradigm. The principle objectives of this portion of the course are to have students go through a process of self-analysis and exploration in hopes that they can better understand their powers and weaknesses, their belief systems, and the various roles that they play, while at the same time learning about their peers. The initial phase of the course is key to the second phase which will look at various community issues and research topics. The overall objective of the course will be to have students engage in critical thought on several levels (self, inter-personal, House, community, worldview) and merge this thought into a relevant research topic. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "WITHOUT STRUGGLE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7253/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.83", "rDifficulty": "1.83", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rWorkRequired": "2.17", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.83", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "WITHOUT STRUGGLE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "AFRC-310-301", "path": "/courses/7253/sections/301", "id": "7253-301", "aliases": ["AFRC-310-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/7253/sections/301/reviews/15-HOWARD-C--STEVENSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/15-HOWARD-C--STEVENSON", "first_name": "HOWARD C.", "last_name": "STEVENSON", "id": "15-HOWARD-C--STEVENSON", "name": "HOWARD C.
