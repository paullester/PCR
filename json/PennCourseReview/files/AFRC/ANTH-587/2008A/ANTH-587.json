{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4513"}, "description": "This graduate seminar examines the dynamic relationships among empires, nations and states; colonial and post-colonial policies; and anti-colonial strategies within a changing global context. Using the rubrics of anthropology, history, cultural studies, and social theory, we will explore the intimacies of subject formation within imperial contexts- past and present- especially in relation to ideas about race and belonging. We will focus on how belonging and participation have been defined in particular locales, as well as how these notions have been socialized through a variety of institutional contexts. Finally, we will consider the relationships between popular culture and state formation, examining these as dialectical struggles for hegemony. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "RACE, NATION, EMPIRE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19760/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.11", "rStimulateInterest": "3.22", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.44", "rWorkRequired": "3.22", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.44", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.89", "rCommAbility": "3.78", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "RACE, NATION, EMPIRE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-587-401", "path": "/courses/19760/sections/401", "id": "19760-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-587-401", "AFRC-587-401", "LALS-588-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/19760/sections/401/reviews/3889-DEBORAH-A--THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3889-DEBORAH-A--THOMAS", "first_name": "DEBORAH A.", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "3889-DEBORAH-A--THOMAS", "name": "DEBORAH A.
