Some students thought the information presented in the course \"was intellectually stimulating\" and found the personal stories that the professor encouraged students \"enjoyable.\" Others believed that the discussions were overly focused on sharing personal anecdotes, rather than thinking critically and sharing insightful thoughts.&#8232;\r\n\r\n&#8232;Students agreed that Professor Beavers taught \"with a breadth and depth that allowed for engagement with the material on a wide spectrum of levels.\u201d However, the professor could be \"a bit pompous,\u201d and many students had difficulty approaching him or discussing concerns about class structure. His \"disorganized style of teaching\" failed to generate quality discussions in class. Nevertheless, a few students commented that, \"as long as [students] are willing to put in work, he's willing to help.\"&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents commented that this class is perfect for an introductory class and that it is likely to have a strong mix of underclassmen and upperclassmen. Students thought that there were too many assigned readings and that they were often unrelated. The assignments such as papers were \"not easily graded.\"\r\n", "num_students": 39, "path": "/courses/22579/sections/401/reviews/1408-HERMAN-BEAVERS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1408-HERMAN-BEAVERS", "first_name": "HERMAN", "last_name": "BEAVERS", "id": "1408-HERMAN-BEAVERS", "name": "HERMAN BEAVERS"}, "num_reviewers": 35, "id": "22579-401-1408-HERMAN-BEAVERS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFRC-001", "path": "/courses/22579", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22579/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTRO AFRICANA STUDIES", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFRC-001-401", "path": "/courses/22579/sections/401", "id": "22579-401", "aliases": ["AFRC-001-401", "ENGL-071-401"]}]}, "id": 22579, "aliases": ["AFRC-001", "ENGL-071"]}
