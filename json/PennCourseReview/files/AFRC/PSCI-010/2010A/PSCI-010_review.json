The seminar analyzes the differences between markets and ownership, the mechanisms by which business and politics influence each other, and the implications for economic growth and equity. Finally, the class will examine the effects of globalization of markets on domestic politics in developing countries. The seminar readings draw upon both conceptual and historical material from a wide range of disciplines and geographical settings.\r\n\r\nStudents raved about this course. More than one student described it as \u201cthe best course I have ever taken at Penn.\u201d Students universally agreed that the class was engaging, saying that it often led to vibrant discussion. The readings were generally regarded as relevant and interesting. Students reported that they gained a great deal of knowledge from the course, with one saying, \u201cI have learned more than I thought possible from a seminar class.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents had even better things to say about Professor Kapur, describing him as a \u201cdynamic teacher\u201d with \u201cseemingly endless knowledge.\u201d He reportedly was kind and understanding, willing to offer feedback at any time, and \u201cmore of a friend than a professor.\u201d More than one student said Professor Kapur was his/her favorite teacher thus far at Penn.\r\n\r\nA student reports that, \u201cWe had about 60-80 pages of reading but it was all relevant and made for amazing discussion in class.\u201d Another student recommended the seminar to all freshmen, regardless of prospective major. The workload in the course appeared to be relatively light. The class is designed for freshmen and has no prerequisites. \r\n\r\n*This review is based on the 6 student comments that were submitted.", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/26650/sections/302/reviews/4081-DEVESH-KAPUR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4081-DEVESH-KAPUR", "first_name": "DEVESH", "last_name": "KAPUR", "id": "4081-DEVESH-KAPUR", "name": "DEVESH KAPUR"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "26650-302-4081-DEVESH-KAPUR"}]
