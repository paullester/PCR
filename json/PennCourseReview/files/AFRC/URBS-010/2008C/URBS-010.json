{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4688"}, "description": "This freshman seminar examines the homelessness problem from a variety of scientific and policy perspectives. Contemporary homelessness differs significantly from related conditions of destitute poverty during other eras of our nation's history. Advocates, researchers and policymakers have all played key roles in defining the current problem, measuring its prevalence, and designing interventions to reduce it. The first section of this course examines the definitional and measurement issues, and how they affect our understanding of the scale and composition of the problem. Explanations for homelessness have also been varied, and the second part of the course focuses on examining the merits of some of those explanations, and in particular, the role of the affordable housing crisis. The third section of the course focuses on the dynamics of homelessness, combining evidence from ethnographic studies of how people become homeless and experience homelessness, with quantitative research on the patterns of entry and exit from the condition. The final section of the course turns to the approaches taken by policymakers and advocates to address the problem, and considers the efficacy and quandaries associated with various policy strategies. The course concludes by contemplating the future of homelessness research and public policy. \n\n", "semester": "2008C", "name": "HOMELSSNSS & URB INEQUAL", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19396/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.05", "rDifficulty": "2.89", "rStimulateInterest": "3.11", "rRecommendMajor": "3.47", "rCourseQuality": "3.05", "rWorkRequired": "3.16", "rInstructorAccess": "3.47", "rReadingsValue": "2.74", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.42", "rCommAbility": "3.58", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "HOMELSSNSS & URB INEQUAL", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-010-401", "path": "/courses/19396/sections/401", "id": "19396-401", "aliases": ["URBS-010-401", "AFRC-041-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/19396/sections/401/reviews/1761-DENNIS-P--CULHANE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1761-DENNIS-P--CULHANE", "first_name": "DENNIS P.", "last_name": "CULHANE", "id": "1761-DENNIS-P--CULHANE", "name": "DENNIS P.
