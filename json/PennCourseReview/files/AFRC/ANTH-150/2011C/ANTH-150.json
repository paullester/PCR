{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5175"}, "description": "This interdisciplinary course explores over two decades of work produced by and about black queer subjects throughout the circum-Atlantic world. While providing an introduction to various artists and intellectuals of the black queer diaspora, this seminar examines the distinct socio-cultural, historical and geographical contexts in which \"black queerness\" as a concept is embraced or contested. We will interrogate the transnational and transcultural mobility of specific aesthetics as well as racial and sexual identity categories more broadly using ethnography, poetry, painting, film, photography and literature. Our aim is to use the prism of artistry to highlight the dynamic relationship between African Diaspora Studies and Queer Studies. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "BLACK QUEER STUDIES: BLACK QUEER STUDIES: A Diasporic Approach", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23965/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.43", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rRecommendMajor": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.57", "rWorkRequired": "3.14", "rInstructorAccess": "3.57", "rReadingsValue": "3.43", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.86", "rCommAbility": "3.57", "rInstructorQuality": "3.57"}, "section": {"name": "BLACK QUEER STUDIES: BLACK QUEER STUDIES: A Diasporic Approach", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-150-401", "path": "/courses/23965/sections/401", "id": "23965-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-150-401", "AFRC-153-401", "GSWS-150-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/23965/sections/401/reviews/5704-LYNDON-K-GILL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5704-LYNDON-K-GILL", "first_name": "LYNDON K", "last_name": "GILL", "id": "5704-LYNDON-K-GILL", "name": "LYNDON K GILL"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "23965-401-5704-LYNDON-K-GILL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-150", "path": "/courses/23965", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23965/sections", "values": [{"name": "BLACK QUEER STUDIES: BLACK QUEER STUDIES: A Diasporic Approach", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-150-401", "path": "/courses/23965/sections/401", "id": "23965-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-150-401", "AFRC-153-401", "GSWS-150-401"]}]}, "id": 23965, "aliases": ["ANTH-150", "AFRC-153", "GSWS-150"]}
