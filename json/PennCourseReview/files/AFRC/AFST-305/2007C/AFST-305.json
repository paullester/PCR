{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3268"}, "description": "This course critically examines the process of constructing and interpreting personal experience/life history narratives told by African women. Urban and rural women's narrative texts are considered as they inform our understanding of the nature of personal experience narrative, the role of collaborating researchers in life history production, and the significance of enabling African women to \"speak for themselves\". Further, these narratives will be studied for the insights they provide into African women's perspectives on family and work, cultural values, personal motivations, and social change. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "AFR WOMEN VCS-PC LIF NAR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12821/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.60", "rDifficulty": "1.40", "rStimulateInterest": "2.40", "rRecommendMajor": "3.40", "rCourseQuality": "2.60", "rWorkRequired": "1.40", "rInstructorAccess": "3.20", "rReadingsValue": "3.40", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.40", "rCommAbility": "2.60", "rInstructorQuality": "2.60"}, "section": {"name": "AFR WOMEN VCS-PC LIF NAR", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-305-601", "path": "/courses/12821/sections/601", "id": "12821-601", "aliases": ["AFST-305-601", "AFRC-305-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/12821/sections/601/reviews/2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "first_name": "PAMELA", "last_name": "BLAKELY", "id": "2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY", "name": "PAMELA BLAKELY"}, "num_reviewers": 5, "id": "12821-601-2033-PAMELA-BLAKELY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFST-305", "path": "/courses/12821", "sections": {"path": "/courses/12821/sections", "values": [{"name": "AFR WOMEN VCS-PC LIF NAR", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "AFST-305-601", "path": "/courses/12821/sections/601", "id": "12821-601", "aliases": ["AFST-305-601", "AFRC-305-601"]}]}, "id": 12821, "aliases": ["AFST-305", "AFRC-305"]}
