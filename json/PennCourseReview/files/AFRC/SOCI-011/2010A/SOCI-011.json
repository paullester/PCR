However, others complained about how too much information was jam-packed into each once-a-week class, while another said \u201cit would be better if it was less lecture-based and more interactive.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Flippen seemed to be relatively well-liked; a student commended her for making the material \u201cunderstandable and coherent.\u201d Students did not have any complaints to register about her or her teaching.\r\n\r\nThe workload and difficulty of the class both appeared reasonable. However, students did seem to think that there was almost too much material delivered in too short of a time. One student reports: \u201cthis class requires a considerable amount of reading, about 100 pages a week.\u201d Another student said they enjoyed the course, but went on to recommend that people that don\u2019t have great interest in cities or sociology should avoid the course. This course is open to all class levels and has no prerequisites. This course fulfills the Cultural Diversity in the U.S. requirement.
