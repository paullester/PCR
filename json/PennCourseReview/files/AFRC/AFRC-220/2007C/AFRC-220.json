{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3814"}, "description": "The goal of Out/Side Blackness is to explore the origins and effects of contemporary constructions of black queerness in America. Central to the course is an understanding of black queer bodies as targets of multiple systems of domination, thus producing black queerness as a consequential form of difference in contemporary American culture; and a recognition of black queer subjectively as the confluence of myriad identities and experiences, thus precluding any single master narrative of black queer life, black queer consciousness, or black queer progress. Presented as an introduction to the burgeoning field of Black Queer Studies, Out/Side Blackness employs the theorectical frameworks of this intellectual discourse to shed new light on, and raise new questions about, the presence of black queers in America. \"Topics include the tensions within black queer identity politics, and the down low and reinterpretations of the closet, black lesbian representations in film, the ballroom scene, black queer spirituality, and the construction of black queer families and communities.\" \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "OUT/SIDE BLACKNESS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/12809/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.33", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.67", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33"}, "section": {"name": "OUT/SIDE BLACKNESS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFRC-220-401", "path": "/courses/12809/sections/401", "id": "12809-401", "aliases": ["AFRC-220-401", "GSOC-220-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/12809/sections/401/reviews/3887-EDWARD-A--BROCKENBROUGH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3887-EDWARD-A--BROCKENBROUGH", "first_name": "EDWARD A.", "last_name": "BROCKENBROUGH", "id": "3887-EDWARD-A--BROCKENBROUGH", "name": "EDWARD A.
