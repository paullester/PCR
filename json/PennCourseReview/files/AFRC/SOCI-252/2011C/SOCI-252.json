{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5268"}, "description": "Sociology provides a unique way to look at human behavior and the world. We live in a world of diverse and conflicting values in which human rights and respect for human dignity have provided a platform for convergence. One important instance of such convergence has been the development of international norms prohibiting genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing. While there is agreement on fundeamental pricinples as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, differences in interpretation remain. A platform for convergence requires the engagement of a number of constituencies, in particular, state and inter-state entities, corporations, civil society and individuals, as well as the mutual reinforcement of their rights and duties. This course will critically cover the history, practice and social significance of human rights. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "HUMAN RIGHTS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25122/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.55", "rDifficulty": "2.27", "rStimulateInterest": "2.73", "rRecommendMajor": "3.27", "rCourseQuality": "2.69", "rWorkRequired": "2.10", "rInstructorAccess": "2.09", "rReadingsValue": "2.55", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.18", "rCommAbility": "2.73", "rInstructorQuality": "2.85"}, "section": {"name": "HUMAN RIGHTS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-252-401", "path": "/courses/25122/sections/401", "id": "25122-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-252-401", "AFRC-252-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/25122/sections/401/reviews/13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI", "first_name": "TUKUFU", "last_name": "ZUBERI", "id": "13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI", "name": "TUKUFU ZUBERI"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "25122-401-13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-252", "path": "/courses/25122", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25122/sections", "values": [{"name": "HUMAN RIGHTS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SOCI-252-401", "path": "/courses/25122/sections/401", "id": "25122-401", "aliases": ["SOCI-252-401", "AFRC-252-401"]}]}, "id": 25122, "aliases": ["SOCI-252", "AFRC-252"]}
