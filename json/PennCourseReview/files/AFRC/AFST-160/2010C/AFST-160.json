The course emphasizes communicative competence to enable the students to acquire linguistic and extra-linguistic skills in Twi. The content of the course is selected from various everyday life situations to enable the students to communicate in predictable common daily settings. Culture, as it relates to language use, is also a part of the course content. \n\nStudents will acquire the speaking, listening, reading and writing skills at the mid-high novice level, based on the ACTFL scale. The mid-high novice level proficiency skills that the students will acquire constitute threshold capabilities of the second semester range of proficiency to prepare students for Elementary Twi II course materials. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "ELEMENTARY TWI I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22582/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rInstructorRapport": "4.00", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rAbilitiesChallenged": "3.50", "rInstructorAttitude": "4.00", "rHomeworkValuable": "3.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.83", "rInstructorConcern": "3.83", "rCourseQuality": "3.83", "rClassPace": "2.00", "rExamsConsistent": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rGradeFairness": "4.00", "rArticulateGoals": "4.00", "rOralSkills": "3.67", "rNativeAbility": "3.83", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "0.50", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rInstructorEffective": "3.83", "rSkillEmphasis": "3.83"}, "section": {"name": "ELEMENTARY TWI I", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "AFST-160-680", "path": "/courses/22582/sections/680", "id": "22582-680", "aliases": ["AFST-160-680", "AFST-562-680", "AFRC-162-680"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/22582/sections/680/reviews/20-KOBINA-OFOSU-DONKOH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/20-KOBINA-OFOSU-DONKOH", "first_name": "KOBINA", "last_name": "OFOSU-DONKOH", "id": "20-KOBINA-OFOSU-DONKOH", "name": "KOBINA OFOSU-DONKOH"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "22582-680-20-KOBINA-OFOSU-DONKOH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFST-160", "path": "/courses/22582", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22582/sections", "values": [{"name": "ELEMENTARY TWI I", "sectionnum": "680", "primary_alias": "AFST-160-680", "path": "/courses/22582/sections/680", "id": "22582-680", "aliases": ["AFST-160-680", "AFST-562-680", "AFRC-162-680"]}]}, "id": 22582, "aliases": ["AFST-160", "AFST-562", "AFRC-162"]}
