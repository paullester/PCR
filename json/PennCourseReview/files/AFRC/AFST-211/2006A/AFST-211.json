It explores the basic cosmological, psychological, and sacred teachings, conveyed, either through arts, architecture, or through rituals. It also gives a vision of the world as such. African philosophy is a tool of national construction, and contributes ultimately to achieving human happiness. This philosophy plays an important role in solving problems of every day life, as well as problems of other intellectural discipline. Knowledge of philosophy enhances our power. It contributes precisely to the articulation of intellectual heritage of humanity, as the envisioned multiculturalism is yet to be built. \n\nThe objectives of the course include: 1. Introduce students to globality of the African experience 2. To compare, contrast, and parallel this experience with others such as the Chinese, the Mayas, the Europeans 3.
