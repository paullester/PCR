{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3262"}, "description": "This course is an examination and analysis of the changing images and achievements of African Americans in motion pictures and television. The first half of the course focuses on African-American film images from the early years of D.W. Griffith's \"renegade bucks\" in The Birth of a Nation (1915); to the comic servants played by Steppin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, and others during the Depression era; to the post-World War II New Negro heroes and heroines of Pinky (1949) and The Defiant Ones (1958); to the rise of the new movement of African American directors such as Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing), Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust), Charles Burnett, (To Sleep With Anger) and John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood). The second half explores television images from the early sitcoms \"Amos 'n Andy\" and \"Beulah\" to the \"Cosby Show,\" \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" and \"Martin.\" Foremost this course will examine Black stereotypes in American films and television--and the manner in which those stereotypes have reflected national attitudes and outlooks during various historical periods. The in-class screenings and discussions will include such films as Show Boat (1936), the independently produced \"race movies\" of the 1930s and 1940s, Cabin in the Sky (1943), The Defiant Ones (1958), Imitation of Life (the 1959 remake) & Super Fly (1972). \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "SEMINAR IN AFAMS: BLACKS IN AMER FILM/TV", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28482/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "3.86", "rCourseQuality": "3.31", "rWorkRequired": "2.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "3.69", "rInstructorAccess": "2.64"}, "section": {"name": "SEMINAR IN AFAMS: BLACKS IN AMER FILM/TV", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFRC-400-401", "path": "/courses/28482/sections/401", "id": "28482-401", "aliases": ["AFRC-400-401", "CINE-370-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/28482/sections/401/reviews/1220-DONALD-E-BOGLE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1220-DONALD-E-BOGLE", "first_name": "DONALD E", "last_name": "BOGLE", "id": "1220-DONALD-E-BOGLE", "name": "DONALD E BOGLE"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "28482-401-1220-DONALD-E-BOGLE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFRC-400", "path": "/courses/28482", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28482/sections", "values": [{"name": "SEMINAR IN AFAMS: BLACKS IN AMER FILM/TV", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFRC-400-401", "path": "/courses/28482/sections/401", "id": "28482-401", "aliases": ["AFRC-400-401", "CINE-370-401"]}]}, "id": 28482, "aliases": ["AFRC-400", "CINE-370"]}
