The course examines music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. \r\n\r\nThis course was taught in many sessions by different instructors, but Professor Holtzman\u2019s classes were \u201cnot solely based on lectures.\u201d According to students, this course was \u201ctaught the right way,\u201d meaning that the course focused more on letting the students learn more rather than merely preparing the students for an exam. The course introduced a lot of different genres of music that students \u201cwould not have had experience with otherwise.\u201d The course also enabled students to \u201cthink differently \u2013 or at least just to think \u2013 about music,\u201d \u201cquestioning things [they] would not normally question.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents stated that Professor Holtzman \u201creally cared about students understanding the material and thinking about it.\u201d He was \u201cexceptional at facilitating course-related discussions and allowing all students to involve themselves.\u201d He was able to create a comfortable environment for students to participate and contribute to the class. According to many, \u201chis passion for the material really came through to students.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents described the course as a \u201cgreat and painless way to fulfill a bunch of general requirements.\u201d The course fulfills the Cross Cultural Analysis and Cultural Diversity in US general requirements, and the Arts & Letters sector. This course was highly recommended for \u201cnon-majors wanting a good introduction to international music and the phenomenon of the world music genre.\u201d\r\n", "num_students": 40, "path": "/courses/26459/sections/404/reviews/4467-GLENN-G-HOLTZMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4467-GLENN-G-HOLTZMAN", "first_name": "GLENN G", "last_name": "HOLTZMAN", "id": "4467-GLENN-G-HOLTZMAN", "name": "GLENN G HOLTZMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 40, "id": "26459-404-4467-GLENN-G-HOLTZMAN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.21", "rDifficulty": "2.21", "rStimulateInterest": "3.63", "rRecommendMajor": "3.46", "rCourseQuality": "3.32", "rWorkRequired": "2.25", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.21", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.54", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD MUSICS & CULTURES", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "MUSC-050-601", "path": "/courses/26459/sections/601", "id": "26459-601", "aliases": ["MUSC-050-601", "FOLK-022-601", "AFST-050-601", "AFRC-050-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/26459/sections/601/reviews/1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "first_name": "TIMOTHY", "last_name": "ROMMEN", "id": "1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN", "name": "TIMOTHY ROMMEN"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "26459-601-1625-TIMOTHY-ROMMEN"}]
