Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to- person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of \"World Music\" by telling a series of stories about recordings made by people culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. Students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.&#8232;\r\n&#8232;Most students found this course to be very interesting and fulfilling. One student explained, \u201cthe course was very organized and the topics chosen were varied.\u201d Another felt the course was \u201ca blend of enjoyment and intellectual stimulation.\u201d However, some students complained that the readings were a bit overwhelming and, at times, felt the lecture was \u201cvery jargony.\u201d&#8232;&#8232;\r\nGenerally, students praised Professor Amico and several declared him to be \u201cone of the best professors\u201d at Penn. Students also found Professor Amico to be knowledgeable, engaging, and approachable. &#8232;\r\n&#8232;The class fulfills the Arts and Letters sector requirements and there are no prerequisites for this course. Students recommended this class to both majors and non-majors and did not find the course to be very difficult.\r\n", "num_students": 64, "path": "/courses/17765/sections/403/reviews/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "first_name": "STEPHEN R", "last_name": "AMICO", "id": "4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO", "name": "STEPHEN R AMICO"}, "num_reviewers": 61, "id": "17765-403-4555-STEPHEN-R-AMICO"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "1.96", "rDifficulty": "2.16", "rStimulateInterest": "1.52", "rRecommendMajor": "2.60", "rCourseQuality": "1.93", "rWorkRequired": "1.84", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "1.88", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.20", "rCommAbility": "2.04", "rInstructorQuality": "1.96"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD MUSICS & CULTURES", "sectionnum": "404", "primary_alias": "MUSC-050-404", "path": "/courses/17765/sections/404", "id": "17765-404", "aliases": ["MUSC-050-404", "FOLK-022-404", "AFRC-050-404", "AFST-050-404"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/17765/sections/404/reviews/4917-MURAT-KEYDER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4917-MURAT-KEYDER", "first_name": "MURAT", "last_name": "KEYDER", "id": "4917-MURAT-KEYDER", "name": "MURAT KEYDER"}, "num_reviewers": 27, "id": "17765-404-4917-MURAT-KEYDER"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.23", "rDifficulty": "1.77", "rStimulateInterest": "3.15", "rRecommendMajor": "3.69", "rCourseQuality": "3.07", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.85", "rReadingsValue": "2.54", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.31", "rCommAbility": "2.92", "rInstructorQuality": "3.47"}, "section": {"name": "WORLD MUSICS & CULTURES", "sectionnum": "405", "primary_alias": "MUSC-050-405", "path": "/courses/17765/sections/405", "id": "17765-405", "aliases": ["MUSC-050-405", "FOLK-022-405", "AFRC-050-405", "AFST-050-405"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/17765/sections/405/reviews/4468-CHRISTINE-N-DANG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4468-CHRISTINE-N-DANG", "first_name": "CHRISTINE N", "last_name": "DANG", "id": "4468-CHRISTINE-N-DANG", "name": "CHRISTINE N DANG"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "17765-405-4468-CHRISTINE-N-DANG"}]
