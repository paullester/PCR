{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2685"}, "description": "Beginning with discussion of various perspectives on social change and law, this course then examines in detail the interdependent relationship between changes in legal and societal institutions. Emphasis will be placed on (1) how and when law can be an instrument for social change, and (2) how and when social change can cause legal change. In the assessment of this relationship, the laws of the United States and other countries as well as international law, will be studied. Throughout the course, discussions will include legal controversies relevant to social change such as civil liberties, gender and the law, and issues of State-Building. A comparative framework will be used in the analysis of this interdependent relationship between law and social change. \n\n", "semester": "2005B", "name": "LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/11337/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.14", "rDifficulty": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.19", "rRecommendMajor": "3.52", "rCourseQuality": "3.24", "rWorkRequired": "2.62", "rInstructorAccess": "3.24", "rReadingsValue": "2.86", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.05", "rCommAbility": "3.14", "rInstructorQuality": "3.38"}, "section": {"name": "LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "SOCI-235-910", "path": "/courses/11337/sections/910", "id": "11337-910", "aliases": ["SOCI-235-910"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/11337/sections/910/reviews/1011-HOCINE-FETNI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1011-HOCINE-FETNI", "first_name": "HOCINE", "last_name": "FETNI", "id": "1011-HOCINE-FETNI", "name": "HOCINE FETNI"}, "num_reviewers": 22, "id": "11337-910-1011-HOCINE-FETNI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SOCI-235", "path": "/courses/11337", "sections": {"path": "/courses/11337/sections", "values": [{"name": "LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE", "sectionnum": "910", "primary_alias": "SOCI-235-910", "path": "/courses/11337/sections/910", "id": "11337-910", "aliases": ["SOCI-235-910"]}]}, "id": 11337, "aliases": ["SOCI-235"]}
