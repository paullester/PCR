This course covers topics from the Atlantic slave trade; the emergence of slavery, the plantation system and the racial order associated with it; the development of African-American life under slavery; the particular relationship between masters and slaves in the antebellum period; the changing gender and class relations of southern society; the defense of slavery; and the unpredictable political road to secession. The course ends by focusing on the Confederate political project and its undoing in the course of the nation's bloodiest war.&#8232;\r\n\r\nOverall students enjoyed this \u201cinteresting\u201d class that they said helped them gain a better understanding of slavery in America. \u201cI have never been so interested in learning about history,\u201d said one student. The class was very well received, but several students complained that there was too much reading assigned each week and especially felt that during weeks with midterms or papers, the reading should be cut back. &#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents raved about Professor McCurry saying she was \u201cone of the most brilliant individuals I have ever met, and it was truly an honor to take this class.\u201d They appreciated her in-depth knowledge of the subject matter and her helpfulness during office hours, but they did recommend that she work to make her PowerPoint slides more helpful. &#8232;\r\n\r\nThis course fulfills a cultural diversity requirement. It is recommended for anyone with an interest in American History. \r\n", "num_students": 77, "path": "/courses/17502/sections/401/reviews/2177-STEPHANIE-MCCURRY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2177-STEPHANIE-MCCURRY", "first_name": "STEPHANIE", "last_name": "MCCURRY", "id": "2177-STEPHANIE-MCCURRY", "name": "STEPHANIE MCCURRY"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "17502-401-2177-STEPHANIE-MCCURRY"}]
