{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5199"}, "description": "Black analysts and activists have been both producers and astute critics of popular culture. This class examines the histories, theories and methods of black cultural studies. We will address themes including diaspora, the city, and media, as well as race, gender, sexuality, and class. The course aims to address the stakes and outcomes of black popular culture: How does blackness shift or change our understanding of popular culture? What are the contours and limits of \"blackness\" in popular culture? How have black critics re-imagined and revised the popular? The course will be arranged thematically, making use of black cultural criticism produced from the 1960s to the present. We will examine the intellectual history of black cultural analysis, its theoretical innovations, and the methods of its critical engagement. Students will be expected to lead at least one discussion during the semester, as well as complete a final project. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "Black Cultural Studies: Histories, Theories, Methods and Critique", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/24218/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "2.29", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.53", "rWorkRequired": "2.93", "rInstructorAccess": "3.36", "rReadingsValue": "2.57", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.36", "rCommAbility": "2.79", "rInstructorQuality": "2.73"}, "section": {"name": "Black Cultural Studies: Histories, Theories, Methods and Critique", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-207-401", "path": "/courses/24218/sections/401", "id": "24218-401", "aliases": ["COMM-207-401", "AFRC-212-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/24218/sections/401/reviews/4635-DANIEL-BERGER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4635-DANIEL-BERGER", "first_name": "DANIEL", "last_name": "BERGER", "id": "4635-DANIEL-BERGER", "name": "DANIEL BERGER"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "24218-401-4635-DANIEL-BERGER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "COMM-207", "path": "/courses/24218", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24218/sections", "values": [{"name": "Black Cultural Studies: Histories, Theories, Methods and Critique", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "COMM-207-401", "path": "/courses/24218/sections/401", "id": "24218-401", "aliases": ["COMM-207-401", "AFRC-212-401"]}]}, "id": 24218, "aliases": ["COMM-207", "AFRC-212"]}
