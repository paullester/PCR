{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3519"}, "description": "The course examines the reforms catalyzed by the federal \"Race to the Top\" competitive grant program and by waivers from No Child Left Behind issued by the federal Department of Education; and explores how these reforms resemble and differ from those mandated by NCLB. Charters, vouchers and competition are discussed along with school governance and funding. Micro as well as macro policy perspectives are provided through the instructor's ongoing work helping Houston's Aldine Independent School District (the 2009 Broad Prize winner with 64,000 low-income and minority students) design and pilot a new teacher evaluation system, a new compensation system, a \"peer assistance and and review\" process for professional development, remediation and dismissal along with related reforms. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "SCHOOL REFORM PUB POLICY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/31116/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.78", "rTAQuality": "3.83", "rStimulateInterest": "3.78", "rCourseQuality": "3.89", "rWorkRequired": "2.89", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89", "rCommAbility": "3.89", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "SCHOOL REFORM PUB POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-460-401", "path": "/courses/31116/sections/401", "id": "31116-401", "aliases": ["URBS-460-401", "AFRC-460-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 9, "path": "/courses/31116/sections/401/reviews/1198-THEODORE-HERSHBERG", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1198-THEODORE-HERSHBERG", "first_name": "THEODORE", "last_name": "HERSHBERG", "id": "1198-THEODORE-HERSHBERG", "name": "THEODORE HERSHBERG"}, "num_reviewers": 9, "id": "31116-401-1198-THEODORE-HERSHBERG"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "URBS-460", "path": "/courses/31116", "sections": {"path": "/courses/31116/sections", "values": [{"name": "SCHOOL REFORM PUB POLICY", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "URBS-460-401", "path": "/courses/31116/sections/401", "id": "31116-401", "aliases": ["URBS-460-401", "AFRC-460-401"]}]}, "id": 31116, "aliases": ["URBS-460", "AFRC-460"]}
