{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4877"}, "description": "Topics vary. A recent topic is \"The Black Body and the Lens.\" The Spring 2013 topic, \"Race in Brazil.: The goal of this course is to have an understanding of race and race-mixing in Brazil with explicit comparisons with the U.S., Mexico, and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. We will compare and contrast forms of racial categorization and ideologies towards race mixture, whether in the form of family formation, nation-building projects, and social policy. Specifically, we will examine how it has been promoted or prevented by society as well as the state. We will draw primarily on social science perspectives, however we will cover some work by historians and legal scholars. By the end of this course, students should have an understanding of the role of race-mixing in both constructing and deconstructing racial categories and its impact on racial and ethnic inequality. This course will count as a requirement for the Africana major and minor. \n\nSee the Africana Studies Department's website at https://africana.sas.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "Race in Brazil: Multiracialism in the Americas and Beyond", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29800/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.75", "rStimulateInterest": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.75", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.00", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorAccess": "2.75"}, "section": {"name": "Race in Brazil: Multiracialism in the Americas and Beyond", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFRC-387-401", "path": "/courses/29800/sections/401", "id": "29800-401", "aliases": ["AFRC-387-401", "SOCI-340-401", "LALS-387-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 4, "path": "/courses/29800/sections/401/reviews/6439-CHINYERE-K-OSUJI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6439-CHINYERE-K-OSUJI", "first_name": "CHINYERE K", "last_name": "OSUJI", "id": "6439-CHINYERE-K-OSUJI", "name": "CHINYERE K OSUJI"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "29800-401-6439-CHINYERE-K-OSUJI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "AFRC-387", "path": "/courses/29800", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29800/sections", "values": [{"name": "Race in Brazil: Multiracialism in the Americas and Beyond", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "AFRC-387-401", "path": "/courses/29800/sections/401", "id": "29800-401", "aliases": ["AFRC-387-401", "SOCI-340-401", "LALS-387-401"]}]}, "id": 29800, "aliases": ["AFRC-387", "SOCI-340", "LALS-387"]}
