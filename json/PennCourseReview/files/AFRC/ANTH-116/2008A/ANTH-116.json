{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3991"}, "description": "This course offers anthropological perspectives on the Caribbean as a geo-political and socio-cultural region, and on contemporary Caribbean diaspora cultures. We will examine how the region's long and diverse colonial history has structured relationships between race, ethnicity, class, gender and power, as well as how people have challenged these structures. As a region in which there have been massive transplantations of peoples and their cultures from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and upon which the United States has exerted considerable influence, we will quesiton the processes by which the meeting and mixing of peoples and cultures has occurred. Course readings include material on the political economy of slavery and the plantation system, family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies, popular culture, and the differing ways national, ethnic, and racial identities are expressed on the islands and throughout the Caribbean diaspora. \n\n", "semester": "2008A", "name": "CARIBBEAN CULT & POLITIC", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/19739/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.64", "rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.14", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.43", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.93", "rCommAbility": "3.43", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "CARIBBEAN CULT & POLITIC", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-116-401", "path": "/courses/19739/sections/401", "id": "19739-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-116-401", "AFRC-629-401", "ANTH-629-401", "AFRC-116-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 15, "path": "/courses/19739/sections/401/reviews/3889-DEBORAH-A--THOMAS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3889-DEBORAH-A--THOMAS", "first_name": "DEBORAH A.", "last_name": "THOMAS", "id": "3889-DEBORAH-A--THOMAS", "name": "DEBORAH A.
