While the Balkans may be familiar as one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite fantasy nightmares\u2014the bloodthirsty Transylvanian count and vampire, Vlad Tepes-Dracula, or Cat People\u2019s horrific historical Serbs who morphed into ferocious black panthers now living in the heart of Manhattan\u2014Balkan cinema is an often overlooked but one of the richest and most significant cinemas of Europe today. While tracing the history of Balkan cinema, the main focus of the course will be on films made during and after the Balkan war in the 1990s, by filmmakers such as Milcho Manchevski, EmirKusturica, Srdjan Dragojevic, Goran Peskaljevic, and Danis Tanovic. These directors achieved great success in their native countries as well as abroad, and started appearing regularly at all major international film festivals. As such they not only mark a significant moment in thinking about the nation but show how a nation has come to depend on the persuasive power of cinema to articulate itself. As we recognize the difficulties in asserting Balkan culture as a unified one, the aim of the course will be to explore an astonishing thematic and stylistic consistency in the cinematic output of the Balkan region. Looking at these shared issues\u2014the turbulent history and volatile politics, a semi-Orientalist positioning sometimes seen as marginality and sometimes as a bridge between East and West, encounters between Christianity and Islam, a legacy of patriarchy and economic dependency--we will examine how cinema of the Balkans testifies to a specific artistic sensibility that comes from a shared socio-cultural space.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nThis course incorporates readings on Balkan history with \u201canalysis of the films, their impact, and how to understand them from the shoes of both a Balkanite and a resident of the world.\u201d Students found that the \u201csupplemental readings to the one required textbook illuminated the topics discussed in class.\u201d They appreciated the \u201cinterdisciplinary nature of the readings\u201d and the \u201camazing\u201d Balkan films on the syllabus, most of which they admit they would not have seen had it not been for the course.&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\nStudents universally praised Professor Mazaj for her \u201corganization,\u201d \u201centhusiasm,\u201d and \u201cimmense knowledge of film theory and history.\u201d One student was \u201cmost impressed with Dr. Mazaj\u2019s creating of the perfect course \u2018arc\u2019\u201d in which \u201cshe started out with students who knew nothing about the region and accumulatively taught them more and more about the region and its art form\u201d to the point \u201cstudents were consistently engaged throughout the class.\u201d Another student noted how Professor Mazaj\u2019s teaching ability consistently \u201ctranslated into stimulating discussions\u201d and how her comprehensive knowledge was well transferred to her class.&#8232;", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/15491/sections/402/reviews/3224-META-MAZAJ", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3224-META-MAZAJ", "first_name": "META", "last_name": "MAZAJ", "id": "3224-META-MAZAJ", "name": "META MAZAJ"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "15491-402-3224-META-MAZAJ"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CINE-202", "path": "/courses/15491", "sections": {"path": "/courses/15491/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS IN FILM PRACTICE: CINEMA OF THE BALKANS", "sectionnum": "402", "primary_alias": "CINE-202-402", "path": "/courses/15491/sections/402", "id": "15491-402", "aliases": ["CINE-202-402", "ENGL-292-402"]}]}, "id": 15491, "aliases": ["CINE-202", "ENGL-292"]}
