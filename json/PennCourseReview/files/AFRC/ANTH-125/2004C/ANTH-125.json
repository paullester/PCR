{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2460"}, "description": "This course approaches the Americas not only as a geographical area but also as an historical and theoretical problem. Drawing from all of the major areas of research in anthropology (biological, archaeological, linguistic, and socio-cultural), we will explore the Americas as a space through which to think about processes of colonization, conquest, imperialism, nation-building, and race-making, understanding these processes as necessarily intwined. We emphasize a transnational hemispheric perspective on the Americas in order to think through what was \"new\" about the \"new world\", long before Columbus landed in Hispaniola in 1492, as well as what continues to be new today as new people, products, and ideas continue to populate the region. Throughout the course, we will contextualize our questions about borderlands and frontiers, empires and colonialism, adaptations and creolizations, and politics and economics within a global frame. And finally, we will highlight the ways anthropologists from different backgrounds have contributed to public debates regarding the most pressing issues facing us today, and can work together to enrich our understandings of various contemporary problems. \n\n", "semester": "2004C", "name": "ORAL COMM:ETIQUETTE&POWR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/4954/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.00", "rRecommendMajor": "2.50", "rCourseQuality": "2.10", "rWorkRequired": "2.60", "rInstructorAccess": "2.50", "rReadingsValue": "2.50", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.11", "rCommAbility": "2.20", "rInstructorQuality": "2.40"}, "section": {"name": "ORAL COMM:ETIQUETTE&POWR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-125-301", "path": "/courses/4954/sections/301", "id": "4954-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-125-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/4954/sections/301/reviews/2049-MICHAEL-P-LEMPERT", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2049-MICHAEL-P-LEMPERT", "first_name": "MICHAEL P", "last_name": "LEMPERT", "id": "2049-MICHAEL-P-LEMPERT", "name": "MICHAEL P LEMPERT"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "4954-301-2049-MICHAEL-P-LEMPERT"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-125", "path": "/courses/4954", "sections": {"path": "/courses/4954/sections", "values": [{"name": "ORAL COMM:ETIQUETTE&POWR", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "ANTH-125-301", "path": "/courses/4954/sections/301", "id": "4954-301", "aliases": ["ANTH-125-301"]}]}, "id": 4954, "aliases": ["ANTH-125"]}
