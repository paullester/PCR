{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5182"}, "description": "This course explores the visual history of race in the United States as both self-fashioning and cultural mythology by examining the ways that conceptions of Native American, Latino, and Asian identity, alongside ideas of Blackness and Whiteness, have combined to create the various cultural ideologies of class, gender, and sexuality that remain evident in historical visual and material culture. We will also investigate the ways that these creations have subsequently helped to launch new visual entertainments, including museum spectacles, blackface minstrelsy, and early film, from the colonial period through the 1940s. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "FACING AMERICA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/26987/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.62", "rDifficulty": "2.29", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.64", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29", "rReadingsValue": "3.36", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.14", "rCommAbility": "3.93", "rInstructorQuality": "3.64"}, "section": {"name": "FACING AMERICA", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-294-601", "path": "/courses/26987/sections/601", "id": "26987-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-294-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/26987/sections/601/reviews/2862-GWENDOLYN-D-SHAW", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2862-GWENDOLYN-D-SHAW", "first_name": "GWENDOLYN D", "last_name": "SHAW", "id": "2862-GWENDOLYN-D-SHAW", "name": "GWENDOLYN D SHAW"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "26987-601-2862-GWENDOLYN-D-SHAW"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ARTH-294", "path": "/courses/26987", "sections": {"path": "/courses/26987/sections", "values": [{"name": "FACING AMERICA", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "ARTH-294-601", "path": "/courses/26987/sections/601", "id": "26987-601", "aliases": ["ARTH-294-601"]}]}, "id": 26987, "aliases": ["ARTH-294"]}
