{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3668"}, "description": "The course will develop our understanding of narrative structure on the basis of oral narratives of personal experience, told by speakers from a wide range of geographic backgrounds and social classes. It will link the principles governing oral narratives to the narratological examination of myth, literature and film by Propp, Greimas, Prince, Chatman, and others.The principles that emerge from the study of oral narrative will be re-examined in literary narrative, including Scandinavian, Greek and Hebrew epics, medieval romances, film, and modern novels, with attention to the differences between vernacular, literary and academic style. The class will then consider the work of psychologists on how narratives are remembered and understood, based on the causal network theory of Trabasso, and apply these principles to narratives written to teach children to read, particularly those designed to reflect the cultural and linguistic framework of African American children. \n\n", "semester": "2012A", "name": "NARRATIVE ANALYSIS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/27690/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "1.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.33", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.63", "rWorkRequired": "2.33", "rInstructorAccess": "2.83", "rReadingsValue": "3.17", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.17", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "NARRATIVE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LING-470-401", "path": "/courses/27690/sections/401", "id": "27690-401", "aliases": ["LING-470-401", "AFRC-262-401", "FOLK-470-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/27690/sections/401/reviews/1884-WILLIAM-LABOV", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1884-WILLIAM-LABOV", "first_name": "WILLIAM", "last_name": "LABOV", "id": "1884-WILLIAM-LABOV", "name": "WILLIAM LABOV"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "27690-401-1884-WILLIAM-LABOV"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LING-470", "path": "/courses/27690", "sections": {"path": "/courses/27690/sections", "values": [{"name": "NARRATIVE ANALYSIS", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "LING-470-401", "path": "/courses/27690/sections/401", "id": "27690-401", "aliases": ["LING-470-401", "AFRC-262-401", "FOLK-470-401"]}]}, "id": 27690, "aliases": ["LING-470", "AFRC-262", "FOLK-470"]}
