{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3655"}, "description": "This course will explore the role of peoples of African descent in the making and transformation of the Atlantic world between the revolutionary era of the late 18th century, which saw the establishment of the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere, and the early decades of the 20th century, when a new pan-African consciousness emerged. We will look at the roles that slavery and the slave trade played in marking the boundaries of a black Atlantic, and we will pay special attention to the part that people of African descent played both in struggles against slavery in the Americas and in the struggles to define the meanings of freedom and peoplehood there and elsewhere. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "SLAVERY,RACE &REVOLUTION", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30464/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.50", "rStimulateInterest": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.94", "rWorkRequired": "2.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.31", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00"}, "section": {"name": "SLAVERY,RACE &REVOLUTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-353-401", "path": "/courses/30464/sections/401", "id": "30464-401", "aliases": ["HIST-353-401", "AFRC-353-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 21, "path": "/courses/30464/sections/401/reviews/2506-STEVEN-HAHN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2506-STEVEN-HAHN", "first_name": "STEVEN", "last_name": "HAHN", "id": "2506-STEVEN-HAHN", "name": "STEVEN HAHN"}, "num_reviewers": 16, "id": "30464-401-2506-STEVEN-HAHN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "HIST-353", "path": "/courses/30464", "sections": {"path": "/courses/30464/sections", "values": [{"name": "SLAVERY,RACE &REVOLUTION", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "HIST-353-401", "path": "/courses/30464/sections/401", "id": "30464-401", "aliases": ["HIST-353-401", "AFRC-353-401"]}]}, "id": 30464, "aliases": ["HIST-353", "AFRC-353"]}
