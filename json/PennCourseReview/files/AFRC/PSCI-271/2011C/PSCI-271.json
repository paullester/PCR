{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3493"}, "description": "This course explores the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in political struggles over the distribution and uses of power in the American constitutional system. Issues include the division of powers between state and national governments, and the branches of the federal government; economic powers of private actors and governmental regulators; the authority of governments to enforce or transform racial and gender hierarchies; and the powers of individuals to make basic choices, such as a woman's power to have an abortion. We will pay special attention to how the tasks of justifying the Supreme Court's own power, and constitutionalism more broadly, contribute to logically debatable, but politically powerful constitutional arguments. Readings include Supreme Court decisions and background materials on their historical and political context. \n\n", "semester": "2011C", "name": "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25017/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.32", "rDifficulty": "2.81", "rStimulateInterest": "3.06", "rRecommendMajor": "3.56", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.77", "rInstructorAccess": "2.90", "rReadingsValue": "3.13", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.63", "rCommAbility": "3.33", "rInstructorQuality": "3.44"}, "section": {"name": "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-271-401", "path": "/courses/25017/sections/401", "id": "25017-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-271-401", "PPE-270-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 75, "path": "/courses/25017/sections/401/reviews/1002-ROGERS-M-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1002-ROGERS-M-SMITH", "first_name": "ROGERS M", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "1002-ROGERS-M-SMITH", "name": "ROGERS M SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 53, "id": "25017-401-1002-ROGERS-M-SMITH"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "PSCI-271", "path": "/courses/25017", "sections": {"path": "/courses/25017/sections", "values": [{"name": "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "PSCI-271-401", "path": "/courses/25017/sections/401", "id": "25017-401", "aliases": ["PSCI-271-401", "PPE-270-401"]}]}, "id": 25017, "aliases": ["PSCI-271", "PPE-270"]}
