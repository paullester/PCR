In this introductory sociology course, students examine and analyze how social structures and cultures are created, maintained, and affect behavior. The course deconstructs our social interactions and examines what theory and research can tell about human social behavior. \r\n\r\nOverall, students found the readings and books helped make the class \u201can excellent experience.\u201d One student explained how the book \u201copened (his) eyes to the problems our world faces today.\u201d Although the readings were interesting, a \u201clarge quantity of reading is required\u201d for this course. \r\n\r\nStudents referred to Professor Zuberi as a \u201cUPenn All-Star and highly educated individual\u201d and a \u201cbrilliant mind.\u201d However, many students felt he was an \u201cunreachable resource\u201d due to the lack of uniform office hours. Professor Zuberi enjoyed triggering \u201ccontroversial class discussion\u201d in lecture and promoting student participation.\r\n\r\nThis is an introductory level course and is open to freshman and upperclassmen. Several students taking this course were interested in a Sociology major or minor. This course fulfills the College Society Sector requirement as well as Cultural Diversity in the U.S. The difficulty of the course stems from the large amount of reading and possibility of pop quizzes.\r\n", "num_students": 168, "path": "/courses/23776/sections/001/reviews/13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI", "first_name": "TUKUFU", "last_name": "ZUBERI", "id": "13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI", "name": "TUKUFU ZUBERI"}, "num_reviewers": 151, "id": "23776-001-13-TUKUFU-ZUBERI"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.72", "rDifficulty": "2.04", "rStimulateInterest": "2.92", "rRecommendMajor": "3.62", "rCourseQuality": "2.52", "rWorkRequired": "2.69", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.73", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "2.72"}, "section": {"name": "INTRO TO SOCIOLOGY", "sectionnum": "601", "primary_alias": "SOCI-001-601", "path": "/courses/23776/sections/601", "id": "23776-601", "aliases": ["SOCI-001-601", "AFRC-002-601"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 30, "path": "/courses/23776/sections/601/reviews/4248-TAMARA-K--NOPPER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4248-TAMARA-K--NOPPER", "first_name": "TAMARA K.", "last_name": "NOPPER", "id": "4248-TAMARA-K--NOPPER", "name": "TAMARA K.
