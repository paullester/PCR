{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4866"}, "description": "This is an introduction to literary study through the works of a single author--often Shakespeare, but some versions of this course will feature other writers. (For offerings in a given semester, please see the on-line coursecal descriptions on the English Department website.) We will read several works and approach them--both in discussion and in writing--from a range of critical perspectives. The author's relation to his or her time, to literary history generally, and to the problems of performance, are likely to be emphasized. This course is designed for the General Requirement; it is also intended to serve as a first or second course for prospective English majors. \n\n", "semester": "2010B", "name": "STUDY OF AN AUTHOR: REVISING VIRGINIA WOOLF", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/21046/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.40", "rDifficulty": "2.80", "rStimulateInterest": "3.75", "rRecommendMajor": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "4.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.80", "rInstructorAccess": "3.60", "rReadingsValue": "3.75", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.60", "rCommAbility": "3.80", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00"}, "section": {"name": "STUDY OF AN AUTHOR: REVISING VIRGINIA WOOLF", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "GSOC-101-920", "path": "/courses/21046/sections/920", "id": "21046-920", "aliases": ["GSOC-101-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 6, "path": "/courses/21046/sections/920/reviews/3941-MELANIE-A-MICIR", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3941-MELANIE-A-MICIR", "first_name": "MELANIE A", "last_name": "MICIR", "id": "3941-MELANIE-A-MICIR", "name": "MELANIE A MICIR"}, "num_reviewers": 6, "id": "21046-920-3941-MELANIE-A-MICIR"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "GSOC-101", "path": "/courses/21046", "sections": {"path": "/courses/21046/sections", "values": [{"name": "STUDY OF AN AUTHOR: REVISING VIRGINIA WOOLF", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "GSOC-101-920", "path": "/courses/21046/sections/920", "id": "21046-920", "aliases": ["GSOC-101-920"]}]}, "id": 21046, "aliases": ["GSOC-101"]}
