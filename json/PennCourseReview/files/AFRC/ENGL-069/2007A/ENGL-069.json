{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/2530"}, "description": "What is poetry and what place does it have among literary forms? What is its relation to culture, history, and our sense of speakers and audiences? This course will focus on various problems in poetic practice and theory, ranging from ancient theories of poetry in Plato and Aristotle to contemporary problems in poetics. In some semesters a particular school of poets may be the focus; in others a historical issue of literary transmission, or a problem of poetic genres, such as lyric, narrative, and dramatic poetry, may be emphasized. The course will provide a basic knowledge of scansion in English with some sense of the historical development of metrics. This course is a good foundation for those who want to continue to study poetry in literary history and for creative writers concentrating on poetry. \n\nSee the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings. \n\n", "semester": "2007A", "name": "POETRY AND POETICS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/14367/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.26", "rDifficulty": "1.70", "rStimulateInterest": "3.59", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "1.81", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "3.48", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.04", "rCommAbility": "3.70", "rInstructorQuality": "3.89"}, "section": {"name": "POETRY AND POETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-069-001", "path": "/courses/14367/sections/001", "id": "14367-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-069-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 28, "path": "/courses/14367/sections/001/reviews/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "first_name": "DEBORAH S", "last_name": "BURNHAM", "id": "437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM", "name": "DEBORAH S BURNHAM"}, "num_reviewers": 28, "id": "14367-001-437-DEBORAH-S-BURNHAM"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ENGL-069", "path": "/courses/14367", "sections": {"path": "/courses/14367/sections", "values": [{"name": "POETRY AND POETICS", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "ENGL-069-001", "path": "/courses/14367/sections/001", "id": "14367-001", "aliases": ["ENGL-069-001"]}]}, "id": 14367, "aliases": ["ENGL-069"]}
