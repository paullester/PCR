{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5613"}, "description": "This course examines the themes of social inequality and ethnographic methodology by working through David Simon's HBO series The Wire, acclaimed by many critics as the best show ever to appear on television. Through our examination of The Wire and other text, this class will study the distribution of key social resources--wealth, power, and status-- to groups and individuals, as well as theoretical explanations of how unequal patterns of distribution are produced, maintained, and challenged. Special consideration will be given to how race, ethnicity, and gender intersect with social class to produce different life experiences for people in various groups in the United States. Through practical, experience-based projects and exposure to the relevant literature, the student will amass a working knowledge of the issues of inequality in urban America, while the vividness and thick description of The Wire's characters will be used to illustrate the viability of anthropological methods to study and address contemporary problems. This course will also focus on the development, design, analysis, and presentation of research with ethnographic depth using observational methods. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "SYMBOLISM OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN THE BLACK DIASPORA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29856/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.33", "rStimulateInterest": "4.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.33", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.33", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67"}, "section": {"name": "SYMBOLISM OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN THE BLACK DIASPORA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-534-401", "path": "/courses/29856/sections/401", "id": "29856-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-534-401", "AFRC-535-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/29856/sections/401/reviews/6447-NICHOLE-P-CARELOCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6447-NICHOLE-P-CARELOCK", "first_name": "NICHOLE P", "last_name": "CARELOCK", "id": "6447-NICHOLE-P-CARELOCK", "name": "NICHOLE P CARELOCK"}, "num_reviewers": 3, "id": "29856-401-6447-NICHOLE-P-CARELOCK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "ANTH-534", "path": "/courses/29856", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29856/sections", "values": [{"name": "SYMBOLISM OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN THE BLACK DIASPORA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "ANTH-534-401", "path": "/courses/29856/sections/401", "id": "29856-401", "aliases": ["ANTH-534-401", "AFRC-535-401"]}]}, "id": 29856, "aliases": ["ANTH-534", "AFRC-535"]}
