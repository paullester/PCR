It is open to beginning graduate students and--with the permission of the instructor--advanced undergraduates. Topics covered include the description of social science data, in graphical and non-graphical form; correlation and other forms of association, including cross-tabulation; bivariate regression; an introduction to probability theory; the logic of sampling; the logic of statistical inference and significance tests. There is a lecture twice weekly and a mandatory \"lab.\"\r\n\r\nStudents found that the course encouraged them to \u201cget beyond thinking about statistics as number crunching\u201d and instead face \u201creal issues of statistics.\u201d The material was described as both \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d However, one student claimed that the \u201cbook was difficult to follow at times.\u201d Overall, it was considered a \u201cgreat fundamental course for statistics.\u201d\r\n\r\nProfessor Smith was described as \u201cdown to earth\u201d and students appreciated his ability to \u201cstimulate his students to really think about the content.\u201d He was praised for giving \u201cgood examples\u201d and for being \u201cable to explain things multiple ways.\u201d He was also deemed \u201cbrilliant\u201d and noted for being able to make \u201cdifficult material accessible\u201d. \r\n\r\nOne student found the exams to be difficult and the homework assignments to be \u201ctime consuming.\u201d However, other students found the homework to be \u201cvaluable\u201d for its ability to help them focus on the content and applicability of the material. The quick feedback was also helpful as it was timely and thorough. The only prerequisite for the course is basic algebra.\r\n", "num_students": 36, "path": "/courses/23801/sections/001/reviews/2338-HERBERT-L-SMITH", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2338-HERBERT-L-SMITH", "first_name": "HERBERT L", "last_name": "SMITH", "id": "2338-HERBERT-L-SMITH", "name": "HERBERT L SMITH"}, "num_reviewers": 33, "id": "23801-001-2338-HERBERT-L-SMITH"}]
