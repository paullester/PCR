Using case studies of highly controversial issues, appropriate statistical techniques and sound quantitative reasoning are addressed. Case studies can include the death penalty, racial profiling, human trafficking, DNA identification, sentencing guidelines, drug testing, war crimes, ballistic analyses from the JFK assassination, and others. The statistical procedures discussed overlap significantly with those covered in an introductory statistics course.

However, other students found the material difficult to understand especially since there was no textbook for the course.&#8232;&#8232;Students reported that Professor Berk was very knowledgeable about his subject. However, some students commented that he was unclear in explaining his expectations for assignments. Additionally, some students wrote that the professor seemed unwilling to answer students\u2019 questions outside of class.&#8232;&#8232;Students with previous experience in statistics found this course easy.
