The course reviews the historical development of criminal justice agencies in the United States and Europe and the available scientific evidence on the effect these agencies have on controlling crime. The course places an emphasis on the functional creation of criminal justice agencies and the discretionary role decision makers in these agencies have in deciding how to enforce criminal laws and whom to punish. Evidence on how society measures crime and the role that each major criminal justice agency plays in controlling crime is examined from the perspective of crime victims, police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, prison officials, probation officers and parole board members. \r\n\r\n\tOverall, this course was described as a \u201cgood introduction to criminology\u201d and a \u201cvery interesting course.\u201d It is taught in a big lecture and the \u201cwork is straightforward.\u201d However, others stated that it was \u201cdull\u201d and the slides were \u201cnot that necessary.\u201d There is a policy paper that is required, but one student commented that he wished it came later in the semester so that there was more information learned.\r\n\r\n\tStudents described Professor Macdonald as a \u201cgood professor\u201d but \u201cwas pretty boring at times.\u201d He is a \u201cgreat lecturer,\u201d but sometimes he \u201cdoes not post helpful material on slides online\u201d and \u201cis not the most entertaining.\u201d His lecturing style could be \u201csomewhat monotonous.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents mentioned that the \u201cworkload was extremely light, and the \u201cpaper and midterm were all extremely fair.\u201d There are some long assigned readings.
