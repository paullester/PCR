{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3031"}, "description": "This course examines how the criminal justice system responds to crime in society. The course reviews the historical development of criminal justice agencies in the United States and Europe and the available scientific evidence on the effect these agencies have on controlling crime. The course places an emphasis onthe functional creation of criminal justice agencies and the discretionary role decision makers in these agencies have in deciding how to enforce criminal laws and whom to punish. Evidence on how society measures crime and the role that each major criminal justice agency plays in controlling crime is examined from the perspective of crime victims, police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, prison officials, probation officers and parole board members. Using the model of social policy evaluation, the course asks students to consider how the results of criminal justice could be more effectively delivered to reduce the social and economic costs of crime. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "CRIMINAL JUSTICE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7517/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.12", "rDifficulty": "1.86", "rStimulateInterest": "3.52", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.23", "rWorkRequired": "1.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.03", "rReadingsValue": "2.28", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.46", "rCommAbility": "3.65", "rInstructorQuality": "3.72"}, "section": {"name": "CRIMINAL JUSTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CRIM-200-401", "path": "/courses/7517/sections/401", "id": "7517-401", "aliases": ["CRIM-200-401", "SOCI-200-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 95, "path": "/courses/7517/sections/401/reviews/1103-LAWRENCE-W-SHERMAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1103-LAWRENCE-W-SHERMAN", "first_name": "LAWRENCE W", "last_name": "SHERMAN", "id": "1103-LAWRENCE-W-SHERMAN", "name": "LAWRENCE W SHERMAN"}, "num_reviewers": 65, "id": "7517-401-1103-LAWRENCE-W-SHERMAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CRIM-200", "path": "/courses/7517", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7517/sections", "values": [{"name": "CRIMINAL JUSTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CRIM-200-401", "path": "/courses/7517/sections/401", "id": "7517-401", "aliases": ["CRIM-200-401", "SOCI-200-401"]}]}, "id": 7517, "aliases": ["CRIM-200", "SOCI-200"]}
