The course places students in the role of one decision-maker after another, emphasizing the decisions they would make with all the scientific research on these decisions at their disposal. Research on 15 different decision-makers is examined, from crime victims to police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, wardens, probation, and parole officers. Using a medical model of evidence-based practice, the course asks students to consider how the results of criminal justice could more effectively reduce the sum of human misery.\r\nStudents could not praise the course enough, describing it as \u201cextremely interesting.\u201d They found that \u201cinformation and concepts [they] learned in this class apply easily to regular life and enhanced [their] understanding of how society and criminal justice works.\u201d\r\nLikewise, students had only positive things to say about Professor Macdonald. Students felt that he was \u201centhusiastic,\u201d \u201cengaging\u201d and \u201ccharismatic.\u201d They felt that Professor Macdonald \u201creally cares about the subject matter,\u201d and was simultaneously \u201cinformative\u201d and \u201centertaining.\u201d\r\nStudents described the class as not particularly demanding and expressed appreciation for the quiz system.
