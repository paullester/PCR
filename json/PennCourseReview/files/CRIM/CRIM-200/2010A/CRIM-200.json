{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3031"}, "description": "This course examines how the criminal justice system responds to crime in society. The course reviews the historical development of criminal justice agencies in the United States and Europe and the available scientific evidence on the effect these agencies have on controlling crime. The course places an emphasis onthe functional creation of criminal justice agencies and the discretionary role decision makers in these agencies have in deciding how to enforce criminal laws and whom to punish. Evidence on how society measures crime and the role that each major criminal justice agency plays in controlling crime is examined from the perspective of crime victims, police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, prison officials, probation officers and parole board members. Using the model of social policy evaluation, the course asks students to consider how the results of criminal justice could be more effectively delivered to reduce the social and economic costs of crime. \n\n", "semester": "2010A", "name": "CRIMINAL JUSTICE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/25850/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.70", "rDifficulty": "1.78", "rStimulateInterest": "2.68", "rRecommendMajor": "3.42", "rCourseQuality": "2.71", "rWorkRequired": "1.70", "rInstructorAccess": "2.92", "rReadingsValue": "2.15", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.04", "rCommAbility": "3.26", "rInstructorQuality": "3.06"}, "section": {"name": "CRIMINAL JUSTICE", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CRIM-200-401", "path": "/courses/25850/sections/401", "id": "25850-401", "aliases": ["CRIM-200-401", "SOCI-200-401"]}, "comments": "This course examines the causes and consequences of the millions of decisions made annually by the legally empowered decision-makers of the criminal justice system. The course places students in the role of one decision-maker after another, emphasizing the decisions they would make with all the scientific research on these decisions at their disposal. Research on 15 different decision-makers is examined, from crime victims to police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, wardens, probation, and parole officers. Using a medical model of evidence-based practice, the course asks students to consider how the results of criminal justice could more effectively reduce the sum of human misery.\r\nStudents could not praise the course enough, describing it as \u201cextremely interesting.\u201d They found that \u201cinformation and concepts [they] learned in this class apply easily to regular life and enhanced [their] understanding of how society and criminal justice works.\u201d\r\nLikewise, students had only positive things to say about Professor Macdonald.
