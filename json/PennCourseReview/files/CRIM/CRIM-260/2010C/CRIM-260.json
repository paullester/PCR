{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5103"}, "description": "From infancy to old age, the risk of people committing crime varies with their overall human development. Explaining and predicting this variation is the central research question in criminology. Tools for understanding the onset of crime, its persistence, intermittency and desistance include the study of birth cohorts of everyone born in a certain time and place, life course studies of juvenile delinquents and non-delinquents, trajectory analysis of people studied from pre-school through middle age, and interviews with 70?year?old former delinquents who reflect on how their life-course affected the crimes they committed. Students are asked to consider what these research findings imply for major theories of crime and policies for crime prevention. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "CRIME & HUMAN DEVELOPMNT", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22886/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.33", "rDifficulty": "2.67", "rStimulateInterest": "2.67", "rRecommendMajor": "3.33", "rCourseQuality": "2.50", "rWorkRequired": "1.67", "rInstructorAccess": "4.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "3.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.25"}, "section": {"name": "CRIME & HUMAN DEVELOPMNT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-260-001", "path": "/courses/22886/sections/001", "id": "22886-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-260-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/22886/sections/001/reviews/3254-PAUL-E-ROCK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3254-PAUL-E-ROCK", "first_name": "PAUL E", "last_name": "ROCK", "id": "3254-PAUL-E-ROCK", "name": "PAUL E ROCK"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "22886-001-3254-PAUL-E-ROCK"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CRIM-260", "path": "/courses/22886", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22886/sections", "values": [{"name": "CRIME & HUMAN DEVELOPMNT", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-260-001", "path": "/courses/22886/sections/001", "id": "22886-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-260-001"]}]}, "id": 22886, "aliases": ["CRIM-260"]}
