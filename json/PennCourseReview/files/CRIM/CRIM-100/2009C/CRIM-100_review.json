It reviews theories and data predicting where, when, by whom and against whom crimes happen. It also addresses the prevention of different offense types by different kinds of offenders against different kinds of people. Police, courts, prisons, and other institutions are critically examined as both preventing and causing crime. \r\n\r\nStudents really enjoyed the guest lecturers that were brought in for this course and found the course to be fairly easy. However, many students complained about the TAs and claimed that the grading process was slow and somewhat arbitrary. \r\n\r\nStudents reported that Professor Adler was very friendly and accessible, but that her slides were somewhat disorganized, and at times, she relied too heavily on her Powerpoint slides. Many students said they did not gain a well-rounded view on the subject matter.\r\n\r\nStudents said that this class was fairly easy and the workload was very manageable. This course fulfills the Society sector and is a good introductory course. \r\n", "num_students": 173, "path": "/courses/17179/sections/401/reviews/4770-FREDA-ADLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4770-FREDA-ADLER", "first_name": "FREDA", "last_name": "ADLER", "id": "4770-FREDA-ADLER", "name": "FREDA ADLER"}, "num_reviewers": 153, "id": "17179-401-4770-FREDA-ADLER"}]
