Some data manipulation will require the use of a statistical computer \"package,\" STATA; but the greater emphasis of the course will be on conceptualization and the ability to manipulate these new ideas both with and without access to statistical software.

Many students reported a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between class material and activities completed in lab.\r\n\r\nStudents described Professor Perrins as \u201cvery receptive to questions\u201d and \u201cvery good at what he does.\u201d However, the lack of communication between Professor Perrins and the lab instructor created confusion. \r\n\r\nThis class is for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Students found this course \u201cdifficult\u201d because of the absence of in depth mathematical explanations. Additionally, students found the final exam challenging because of the vast amount of material covered.\r\n", "num_students": 23, "path": "/courses/22890/sections/001/reviews/5604-GERALD-PERRINS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5604-GERALD-PERRINS", "first_name": "GERALD", "last_name": "PERRINS", "id": "5604-GERALD-PERRINS", "name": "GERALD PERRINS"}, "num_reviewers": 23, "id": "22890-001-5604-GERALD-PERRINS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CRIM-535", "path": "/courses/22890", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22890/sections", "values": [{"name": "QUANTITATIVE METHODS I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-535-001", "path": "/courses/22890/sections/001", "id": "22890-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-535-001"]}]}, "id": 22890, "aliases": ["CRIM-535"]}
