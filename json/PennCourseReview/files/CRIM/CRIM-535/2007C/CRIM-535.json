{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3865"}, "description": "This course is an introduction to the practice of statistics in social and behavioral sciences. It is open to beginning graduate students and--with the permission of the instructor--advanced undergraduates. Topics covered include the description of social science data, in graphical and non-graphical form; correlation and other forms of association, including cross-tabulation; bivariate regression; an introduction to probability theory; the logic of sampling; the logic of statistical inference and significance tests. Some data manipulation will require the use of a statistical computer \"package,\" STATA; but the greater emphasis of the course will be on conceptualization and the ability to manipulate these new ideas both with and without access to statistical software. There is a lecture twice weekly and a mandatory \"lab.\" \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "QUANTITATIVE METHODS I", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13085/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.00", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "2.57", "rRecommendMajor": "2.22", "rCourseQuality": "2.09", "rWorkRequired": "2.26", "rInstructorAccess": "2.57", "rReadingsValue": "2.30", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.87", "rCommAbility": "2.35", "rInstructorQuality": "2.78"}, "section": {"name": "QUANTITATIVE METHODS I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-535-001", "path": "/courses/13085/sections/001", "id": "13085-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-535-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 35, "path": "/courses/13085/sections/001/reviews/3928-RICHARD-A--BERK", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3928-RICHARD-A--BERK", "first_name": "RICHARD A.", "last_name": "BERK", "id": "3928-RICHARD-A--BERK", "name": "RICHARD A.
