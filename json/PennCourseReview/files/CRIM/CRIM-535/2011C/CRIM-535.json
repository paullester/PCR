While it was recognized that statistics is hard to teach, most students were underwhelmed and confused by course content, which many deemed had \u201cnothing to do with criminology\u201d and \u201ccovered topics that were redundant\u201d from undergraduate courses. Furthermore, the tests and assignments were \u201cboth vague and difficult to complete.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Professor Perrins was noted as a \u201cskilled statistician,\u201d students viewed his teaching style as \u201cscattered and poor\u201d and \u201crepetitive from the readings.\u201d Many people believed he taught solely from the textbook and PowerPoints and wasn\u2019t able to discuss the material beyond these tools. In addition, students felt Professor Perrins wasn\u2019t \u201cclear and logical\u201d in his teaching method, which caused \u201cambiguous\u201d assignments and \u201cconfusing\u201d presentations.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory portion of this course uses a computer program that students deemed \u201cexpensive and only available at certain Penn labs,\u201d which led to difficulty in completing assignments. As much of the work in class was done in pairs, students needed to coordinate with each other in order to complete their assignments.\r\n\r\n*This review is based on nine student comments.\r\n", "num_students": 26, "path": "/courses/24234/sections/001/reviews/5604-GERALD-PERRINS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5604-GERALD-PERRINS", "first_name": "GERALD", "last_name": "PERRINS", "id": "5604-GERALD-PERRINS", "name": "GERALD PERRINS"}, "num_reviewers": 18, "id": "24234-001-5604-GERALD-PERRINS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CRIM-535", "path": "/courses/24234", "sections": {"path": "/courses/24234/sections", "values": [{"name": "QUANTITATIVE METHODS I", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-535-001", "path": "/courses/24234/sections/001", "id": "24234-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-535-001"]}]}, "id": 24234, "aliases": ["CRIM-535"]}
