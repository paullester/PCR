{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5644"}, "description": "This course will expose students to the field of neurolaw, drawing on concepts from neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, ethics, philosophy, social policy, criminology, and law. The course will discuss how neuroscience is related to criminal culpability and civil liability and how the legal system has responded to discoveries regarding brain development and cognitive disabilities. We will debate how the law should consider brain based abnormalities that result from degenerative brain disease, addiction, concussion due to sports injury and war trauma. (All scientific and legal concepts will be presented in an accessible manner. No prior science, medical or legal background is required for this course.) \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "NEUROLAW", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30123/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "1.62", "rStimulateInterest": "3.36", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.07", "rInstructorQuality": "3.73", "rCommAbility": "3.64", "rInstructorAccess": "3.29"}, "section": {"name": "NEUROLAW", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-340-001", "path": "/courses/30123/sections/001", "id": "30123-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-340-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/30123/sections/001/reviews/6478-SUSAN-E--RUSHING", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6478-SUSAN-E--RUSHING", "first_name": "SUSAN E.", "last_name": "RUSHING", "id": "6478-SUSAN-E--RUSHING", "name": "SUSAN E.
