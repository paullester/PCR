What makes a successful psychopath? And is it morally wrong for us to punish those who are biologically-wired for a life of crime? This course argues that answers to these inscrutable questions will ultimately be found in an interdisciplinary perspective that examines the interface between the social, clinical, and neurosciences. We will explore new biosocial treatments for violence, and analyze the controversial neuroethical, legal, and philosophical issues surrounding neurocriminology. The course presents perspectives from fields of psychology, neurobiology, sociology, neurochemistry, anthropology, law, neuroanatomy, cinema, public health, neuroendocrinology, criminology, forensics, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Only by integrating knowledge from multiple domains will we fully understand, predict, and prevent future criminal behavior.\r\n\r\nStudents commented that despite being a 3-hour lecture, this course was \u201cengaging,\u201d and \u201cstimulating.\u201d Students especially enjoyed the field trip, guest lecturer, and video clips. \r\n\r\nMost students enjoyed Professor Raine\u2019s lectures, calling him, \u201ca wonderful lecturer,\u201d \u201centertaining,\u201d and \u201cknowledgeable.\u201d Students described Professor Raine as a, \u201cleader in the field of Biosocial Criminology,\u201d and \u201cable to stimulate interest about some material that can be considered a little dry.\u201d \r\n\r\nSome students complained that the due dates for the final exam and final paper were \u201ctoo close to each other.\u201d However, students highly recommended the course, even to students who do not already have an interest in criminology. \r\n", "num_students": 60, "path": "/courses/17181/sections/001/reviews/4771-ADRIAN-RAINE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4771-ADRIAN-RAINE", "first_name": "ADRIAN", "last_name": "RAINE", "id": "4771-ADRIAN-RAINE", "name": "ADRIAN RAINE"}, "num_reviewers": 55, "id": "17181-001-4771-ADRIAN-RAINE"}]
