{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/4546"}, "description": "Is there a natural-born killer? What makes a successful psychopath? And is it morally wrong for us to punish those who are biologically-wired for a life of crime? This course argues that answers to these inscrutable questions will ultimately be found in an interdisciplinary perspective that examines the interface between the social, clinical, and neuro-sciences. We will explore new biosocial treatments for violence, and analyze the controversial neuroethical, legal, and philosophical issues surrounding neurocriminology. The course presents perspectives from fields of psychology, neurobiology, sociology, neurochemistry, anthropology, law, neuroanatomy, cinema, public health, neuroendocrinology, criminology forensics, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Only by integrating knowledge from multiple domains will we fully understand, predict, and prevent future criminal behavior. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "BIOSOCIAL CRIMINOLOGY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28772/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "2.23", "rTAQuality": "2.57", "rStimulateInterest": "3.58", "rCourseQuality": "3.29", "rWorkRequired": "1.90", "rInstructorQuality": "3.61", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorAccess": "2.96"}, "section": {"name": "BIOSOCIAL CRIMINOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-370-001", "path": "/courses/28772/sections/001", "id": "28772-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-370-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 98, "path": "/courses/28772/sections/001/reviews/4771-ADRIAN-RAINE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4771-ADRIAN-RAINE", "first_name": "ADRIAN", "last_name": "RAINE", "id": "4771-ADRIAN-RAINE", "name": "ADRIAN RAINE"}, "num_reviewers": 80, "id": "28772-001-4771-ADRIAN-RAINE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "CRIM-370", "path": "/courses/28772", "sections": {"path": "/courses/28772/sections", "values": [{"name": "BIOSOCIAL CRIMINOLOGY", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "CRIM-370-001", "path": "/courses/28772/sections/001", "id": "28772-001", "aliases": ["CRIM-370-001"]}]}, "id": 28772, "aliases": ["CRIM-370"]}
