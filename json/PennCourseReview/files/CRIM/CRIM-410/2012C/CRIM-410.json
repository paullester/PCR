{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3333"}, "description": "This seminar focuses on examining data from experiments in criminology including: randomized controlled trials of criminal justice policies, \"natural\" experiments in crime, and other quasi-experimental studies. A series of experiments conducted by Penn scholars and elsewhere will be examined. This seminar also guides criminology majors in writing a research proposal for their thesis. Students will learn about how to formulate a research question, develop a review of the literature, and how to apply necessary empirical methods. The final paper for this course will be a research proposal that can serve as the basis for the student's senior thesis and to satisfy the senior capstone requirement. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "Research Seminar on Experiments in Crime and Justice", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/28773/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.12", "rStimulateInterest": "2.82", "rCourseQuality": "2.47", "rWorkRequired": "3.41", "rInstructorQuality": "2.94", "rCommAbility": "3.06", "rInstructorAccess": "3.65"}, "section": {"name": "Research Seminar on Experiments in Crime and Justice", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "CRIM-410-401", "path": "/courses/28773/sections/401", "id": "28773-401", "aliases": ["CRIM-410-401", "CRIM-610-401", "SOCI-410-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 19, "path": "/courses/28773/sections/401/reviews/6252-CHARLES-E--LOEFFLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/6252-CHARLES-E--LOEFFLER", "first_name": "CHARLES E.", "last_name": "LOEFFLER", "id": "6252-CHARLES-E--LOEFFLER", "name": "CHARLES E.
