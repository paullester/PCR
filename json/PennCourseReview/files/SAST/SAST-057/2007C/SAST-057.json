{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3938"}, "description": "In this course we will trace the economic development of India from 1947 to the present. Independent India started out as a centrally planned economy in 1949 but in 1991 decided to reduce its public sector and allow, indeed encourage, foreign investors to come in. The Planning Commission of India still exists but has lost much of its power. Many in the U.S. complain of American jobs draining off to India, call centers in India taking care of American customer complaints, American patient histories being documented in India, etc. At the same time, the U.S. government encourages highly trained Indians to be in the U.S. \n\nStudents are expected to write four one-page response papers and one final paper. Twenty percent of the final grade will be based on class participation, 20 percent on the four response papers and 60 percent on the final paper. \n\n", "semester": "2007C", "name": "PLANNING TO BE OFFSHORE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/13862/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.10", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "2.90", "rRecommendMajor": "3.20", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "2.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.70", "rReadingsValue": "2.80", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.30", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.60"}, "section": {"name": "PLANNING TO BE OFFSHORE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SAST-057-301", "path": "/courses/13862/sections/301", "id": "13862-301", "aliases": ["SAST-057-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/13862/sections/301/reviews/1276-SRILATA-GANGULEE", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1276-SRILATA-GANGULEE", "first_name": "SRILATA", "last_name": "GANGULEE", "id": "1276-SRILATA-GANGULEE", "name": "SRILATA GANGULEE"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "13862-301-1276-SRILATA-GANGULEE"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-057", "path": "/courses/13862", "sections": {"path": "/courses/13862/sections", "values": [{"name": "PLANNING TO BE OFFSHORE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "SAST-057-301", "path": "/courses/13862/sections/301", "id": "13862-301", "aliases": ["SAST-057-301"]}]}, "id": 13862, "aliases": ["SAST-057"]}
