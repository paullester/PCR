{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5045"}, "description": "This is an introduction to studying gender systems and women's situations across cultures and countries with a special emphasis on South-Asia. The class focuses on \"globalization,\" the flows of people and culture that are increasing around the world. The class begins with the historical background for understanding the current period of globalization. We will look at the specific case of colonization in South Asia and emphasize its role in the rise of factories in both colonized and colonizing nations. We then consider the role of these factories in today's world as they employ women from the third world (sweatshops), and explore other issues related to gender and globalization and discuss scholarly responses to the changing world system. This class approach stresses that in order to understand women's lives in the non-western world, it is important to understand the on-going connections between the \"first world\" and between the United States and the rest of the world. The larger objectives of the course are: 1.To learn about the history and current conditions of South Asia, particularly as they affect women and gender. 2.To be able to identify relations between the \"first world\" and the \"third world through an understanding of elements of globalization \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "WOMEN SOCIAL MVMTS IN SA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22418/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.86", "rDifficulty": "3.14", "rStimulateInterest": "2.43", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "2.57", "rWorkRequired": "3.43", "rInstructorAccess": "3.00", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.57", "rCommAbility": "2.29", "rInstructorQuality": "2.29"}, "section": {"name": "WOMEN SOCIAL MVMTS IN SA", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "SAST-495-640", "path": "/courses/22418/sections/640", "id": "22418-640", "aliases": ["SAST-495-640"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/22418/sections/640/reviews/5529-RAILI-ROY", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5529-RAILI-ROY", "first_name": "RAILI", "last_name": "ROY", "id": "5529-RAILI-ROY", "name": "RAILI ROY"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "22418-640-5529-RAILI-ROY"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-495", "path": "/courses/22418", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22418/sections", "values": [{"name": "WOMEN SOCIAL MVMTS IN SA", "sectionnum": "640", "primary_alias": "SAST-495-640", "path": "/courses/22418/sections/640", "id": "22418-640", "aliases": ["SAST-495-640"]}]}, "id": 22418, "aliases": ["SAST-495"]}
