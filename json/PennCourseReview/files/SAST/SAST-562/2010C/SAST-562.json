{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5164"}, "description": "This course will provide an in-depth understanding of South Asia in what is often called its 'medieval' period--from the rise of the great temple kingdoms until the end of the Delhi Sultanate in the sixteenth century (c. 500 CE - c. 1500 CE). This millennium is arguably one of the most transformative in South Asia's history, a period when many of its most distinctive social and cultural features evolved. The course will provide both an overview of the period as well as an introduction to major interpretations and types of sources (textual, visual, and archaeological). The focus throughout the course will be on the heterogeneous development of states, societies and cultures with special attention to long-term processes of transformation. One set of themes explored will be largely social and economic, focusing on the development of agrarian and peasant societies, aristocracies and intellectuals, as well as the role of mercantile, pastoralist, nomadic and forest-living groups. Another set of themes will explore cultural transformation, including the development, transformation and interaction of religious practices, the emergence of cosmopolitan and regional literary cultures, and the rise of distinctive urban, courtly, and rural worldviews. \n\nSpecial themes of discussion may include violence and manners, material cultures, religious conflict, devotional religion and gender relations. \n\n", "semester": "2010C", "name": "MAKING/MEDIEVAL INDIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/23767/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.25", "rDifficulty": "3.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.25", "rRecommendMajor": "3.67", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.25", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.67", "rCommAbility": "3.75", "rInstructorQuality": "3.75"}, "section": {"name": "MAKING/MEDIEVAL INDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-562-401", "path": "/courses/23767/sections/401", "id": "23767-401", "aliases": ["SAST-562-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 7, "path": "/courses/23767/sections/401/reviews/4975-DAUD-ALI", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4975-DAUD-ALI", "first_name": "DAUD", "last_name": "ALI", "id": "4975-DAUD-ALI", "name": "DAUD ALI"}, "num_reviewers": 4, "id": "23767-401-4975-DAUD-ALI"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-562", "path": "/courses/23767", "sections": {"path": "/courses/23767/sections", "values": [{"name": "MAKING/MEDIEVAL INDIA", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-562-401", "path": "/courses/23767/sections/401", "id": "23767-401", "aliases": ["SAST-562-401"]}]}, "id": 23767, "aliases": ["SAST-562"]}
