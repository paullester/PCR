{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5044"}, "description": "This course will focus on the globality of contemporary warfare and its increasingly expansive, though increasingly undefined, social scope, through a multi-dinsional focus on the Afghan conflict in particular. We will explore the development of increasingly wide-reaching non-state interests in formerly localized conflicts, as well as the domestic and global cultural and political changes that have been related to the US's ongoing military actions since 2001. \n\n", "semester": "2011A", "name": "GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/22415/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.93", "rDifficulty": "2.36", "rStimulateInterest": "2.36", "rRecommendMajor": "3.29", "rCourseQuality": "2.64", "rWorkRequired": "2.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.29", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.50", "rCommAbility": "2.43", "rInstructorQuality": "2.71"}, "section": {"name": "GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-383-401", "path": "/courses/22415/sections/401", "id": "22415-401", "aliases": ["SAST-383-401", "SAST-683-401"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 16, "path": "/courses/22415/sections/401/reviews/4974-JAMES-CARON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4974-JAMES-CARON", "first_name": "JAMES", "last_name": "CARON", "id": "4974-JAMES-CARON", "name": "JAMES CARON"}, "num_reviewers": 14, "id": "22415-401-4974-JAMES-CARON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-383", "path": "/courses/22415", "sections": {"path": "/courses/22415/sections", "values": [{"name": "GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR", "sectionnum": "401", "primary_alias": "SAST-383-401", "path": "/courses/22415/sections/401", "id": "22415-401", "aliases": ["SAST-383-401", "SAST-683-401"]}]}, "id": 22415, "aliases": ["SAST-383", "SAST-683"]}
