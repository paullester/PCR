{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/5595"}, "description": "This course will explore the histiography and theory of caste and class in South Asia. While we will survey the evidence from the pre-modern period briefly, the primary focus of the course will be on the period between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. We will examine the degree to which colonial rule triggered particular kinds of class-oriented and caste-oriented 'reform', and the extent to which South Asian actors themselves shaped the nature of such change. The course will also provide an introduction to the work of the Subaltern school historians who have engaged with such questions, and situate them within the wider field of South Asian historiography. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "CASTE & CLASS SOUTH ASIA", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29635/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.43", "rStimulateInterest": "3.57", "rCourseQuality": "3.57", "rWorkRequired": "3.29", "rInstructorQuality": "3.71", "rCommAbility": "3.86", "rInstructorAccess": "3.14"}, "section": {"name": "CASTE & CLASS SOUTH ASIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SAST-593-001", "path": "/courses/29635/sections/001", "id": "29635-001", "aliases": ["SAST-593-001"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 12, "path": "/courses/29635/sections/001/reviews/5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN", "first_name": "RAMYA", "last_name": "SREENIVASAN", "id": "5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN", "name": "RAMYA SREENIVASAN"}, "num_reviewers": 7, "id": "29635-001-5870-RAMYA-SREENIVASAN"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "SAST-593", "path": "/courses/29635", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29635/sections", "values": [{"name": "CASTE & CLASS SOUTH ASIA", "sectionnum": "001", "primary_alias": "SAST-593-001", "path": "/courses/29635/sections/001", "id": "29635-001", "aliases": ["SAST-593-001"]}]}, "id": 29635, "aliases": ["SAST-593"]}
