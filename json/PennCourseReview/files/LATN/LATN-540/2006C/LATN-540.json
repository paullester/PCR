{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/3146"}, "description": "This course will use a series of selected readings in Latin prose to construct a tentative literary history, or set of histories. We will look at individual works in their own right, attending to language, form, and context (author, genre, milieu, etc.). We will consider some of the theoretical approaches to literary interpretation that have proven successful with specific works, as well as some broader questions around the construction of a Latin literary history. Assignments will include presentation, midterm, short paper, and final exam. \n\n", "semester": "2006C", "name": "ADVANCED LATIN SURVEY", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/9141/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.50", "rDifficulty": "3.60", "rStimulateInterest": "3.60", "rRecommendMajor": "3.70", "rCourseQuality": "3.60", "rWorkRequired": "3.90", "rInstructorAccess": "3.40", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "0.30", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorQuality": "3.90"}, "section": {"name": "ADVANCED LATIN SURVEY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-540-301", "path": "/courses/9141/sections/301", "id": "9141-301", "aliases": ["LATN-540-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 10, "path": "/courses/9141/sections/301/reviews/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "first_name": "JOSEPH A", "last_name": "FARRELL", "id": "263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL", "name": "JOSEPH A FARRELL"}, "num_reviewers": 10, "id": "9141-301-263-JOSEPH-A-FARRELL"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LATN-540", "path": "/courses/9141", "sections": {"path": "/courses/9141/sections", "values": [{"name": "ADVANCED LATIN SURVEY", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-540-301", "path": "/courses/9141/sections/301", "id": "9141-301", "aliases": ["LATN-540-301"]}]}, "id": 9141, "aliases": ["LATN-540"]}
