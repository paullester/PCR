{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/663"}, "description": "This course is designed to prepare graduate students both in medieval studies and in classics for research on the Latin texts of the Middle Ages. A basic competence in Latin is presupposed; students with doubts about their preparation should contact the instructor for advice. Readings, some of which will be chosen by participants in the course, will cover a wide generic and chronological range but will reflect the familiar medieval intersection of books and bodies. \n\n", "semester": "2002A", "name": "POST CLASSICAL LATIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/663/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.06", "rDifficulty": "2.76", "rStimulateInterest": "3.53", "rRecommendMajor": "3.50", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.94", "rInstructorAccess": "3.71", "rReadingsValue": "3.18", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.07", "rCommAbility": "3.71", "rInstructorQuality": "3.82"}, "section": {"name": "POST CLASSICAL LATIN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-410-301", "path": "/courses/663/sections/301", "id": "663-301", "aliases": ["LATN-410-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 18, "path": "/courses/663/sections/301/reviews/702-MICHAEL-SHANE-BUTLER", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/702-MICHAEL-SHANE-BUTLER", "first_name": "MICHAEL SHANE", "last_name": "BUTLER", "id": "702-MICHAEL-SHANE-BUTLER", "name": "MICHAEL SHANE BUTLER"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "663-301-702-MICHAEL-SHANE-BUTLER"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LATN-410", "path": "/courses/663", "sections": {"path": "/courses/663/sections", "values": [{"name": "POST CLASSICAL LATIN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-410-301", "path": "/courses/663/sections/301", "id": "663-301", "aliases": ["LATN-410-301"]}]}, "id": 663, "aliases": ["LATN-410"]}
