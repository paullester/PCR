Close reading and discussion of a Latin author or a particular genre of latin literature. Topics will vary each semester, and the course may be repeated for credit. \n\nfall 2013 Topic: This course focuses on the writings of Seneca -- the Stoic philosopher, tragedian, and advisor to the emperor Nero. In the first half of the course we will read selections from four scenarios: the author consoling his mother from exile (Consolatio ad Helviam), advising Nero (De Clementia), and teaching philosophy to his younger friend Lucilius (Epistulae Morales); and Seneca's dramatic portrayal of the tragic heroine who kills her children (Medea). In the second half of the course we will read in its entirety Seneca's controversial work Consolatio ad Polybium, in which Seneca requests to be pardoned by the emperor Claudius. \n\n", "semester": "2013A", "name": "TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE: TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/30527/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.17", "rTAQuality": "4.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.80", "rCourseQuality": "3.67", "rWorkRequired": "2.67", "rInstructorQuality": "4.00", "rCommAbility": "4.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE: TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-301", "path": "/courses/30527/sections/301", "id": "30527-301", "aliases": ["LATN-309-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/30527/sections/301/reviews/1472-EMILY-R--C--WILSON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1472-EMILY-R--C--WILSON", "first_name": "EMILY R.
