{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/662"}, "description": "This course is for those who have completed Latin 204, Latin 212, or equivalent (such as placement score of 650, or AP score of 4 or 5). Close reading and discussion of a Latin author or a particular genre of latin literature. Topics will vary each semester, and the course may be repeated for credit. \n\nFall 2012 Topic:Caesar and Lucan both produced literary treatments of the first phase of the civil war that finally destroyed the Roman Republic, the contest between Caesar and Pompey for supremacy at Rome. This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt, Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir, Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events, the two authors' literary and political aims, as well as their historical contexts, produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem. In Latin we will cover substantial portions of the three books of Caesar's Civil War and the ten books of Lucan's. We will read the entirety of both works in English. \n\n", "semester": "2006A", "name": "PLAUTUS", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/7950/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.24", "rDifficulty": "2.65", "rStimulateInterest": "3.41", "rRecommendMajor": "3.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.47", "rWorkRequired": "2.71", "rInstructorAccess": "3.59", "rReadingsValue": "3.41", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.12", "rCommAbility": "3.47", "rInstructorQuality": "3.76"}, "section": {"name": "PLAUTUS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-301", "path": "/courses/7950/sections/301", "id": "7950-301", "aliases": ["LATN-309-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 17, "path": "/courses/7950/sections/301/reviews/1473-JULIE-NISHIMURA-JENSEN", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/1473-JULIE-NISHIMURA-JENSEN", "first_name": "JULIE", "last_name": "NISHIMURA-JENSEN", "id": "1473-JULIE-NISHIMURA-JENSEN", "name": "JULIE NISHIMURA-JENSEN"}, "num_reviewers": 17, "id": "7950-301-1473-JULIE-NISHIMURA-JENSEN"}, {"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "2.54", "rDifficulty": "2.77", "rStimulateInterest": "2.85", "rRecommendMajor": "3.85", "rCourseQuality": "2.92", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.67", "rReadingsValue": "2.46", "rRecommendNonMajor": "1.54", "rCommAbility": "3.15", "rInstructorQuality": "3.15"}, "section": {"name": "PLAUTUS", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-302", "path": "/courses/7950/sections/302", "id": "7950-302", "aliases": ["LATN-309-302"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 14, "path": "/courses/7950/sections/302/reviews/3031-MARIAN-W-MAKINS", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/3031-MARIAN-W-MAKINS", "first_name": "MARIAN W", "last_name": "MAKINS", "id": "3031-MARIAN-W-MAKINS", "name": "MARIAN W MAKINS"}, "num_reviewers": 13, "id": "7950-302-3031-MARIAN-W-MAKINS"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LATN-309", "path": "/courses/7950", "sections": {"path": "/courses/7950/sections", "values": [{"name": "PLAUTUS", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-301", "path": "/courses/7950/sections/301", "id": "7950-301", "aliases": ["LATN-309-301"]}, {"name": "PLAUTUS", "sectionnum": "302", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-302", "path": "/courses/7950/sections/302", "id": "7950-302", "aliases": ["LATN-309-302"]}]}, "id": 7950, "aliases": ["LATN-309"]}
