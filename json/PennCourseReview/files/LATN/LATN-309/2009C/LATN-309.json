This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt, Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir, Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events, the two authors' literary and political aims, as well as their historical contexts, produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem. In Latin we will cover substantial portions of the three books of Caesar's Civil War and the ten books of Lucan's. We will read the entirety of both works in English. \n\n", "semester": "2009C", "name": "VIRGIL,ECOLOGUES&HORACE: Virgil, Eclogues and Horace, Sermones", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/17589/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.11", "rDifficulty": "2.84", "rStimulateInterest": "3.21", "rRecommendMajor": "3.84", "rCourseQuality": "3.37", "rWorkRequired": "2.79", "rInstructorAccess": "3.42", "rReadingsValue": "3.37", "rRecommendNonMajor": "2.21", "rCommAbility": "3.67", "rInstructorQuality": "3.74"}, "section": {"name": "VIRGIL,ECOLOGUES&HORACE: Virgil, Eclogues and Horace, Sermones", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-301", "path": "/courses/17589/sections/301", "id": "17589-301", "aliases": ["LATN-309-301"]}, "comments": "This course is for those who have completed Latin 204, Latin 212, or equivalent (such as placement score of 650, or AP score of 4 or 5).
