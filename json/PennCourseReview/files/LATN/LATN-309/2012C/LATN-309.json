{"coursehistories": {"path": "/coursehistories/662"}, "description": "This course is for those who have completed Latin 204, Latin 212, or equivalent (such as placement score of 650, or AP score of 4 or 5). Close reading and discussion of a Latin author or a particular genre of latin literature. Topics will vary each semester, and the course may be repeated for credit. \n\nSpring 2013 Topic: Virgil. Most students who reach 3rd year Latin have read bits of the Aeneid in the original, but many have not had an opportunity to go through the greatest epic of Augustan Rome in its entirety. In this course, wewill focus on one book of the Aeneid every week, and read substantial amounts of each in Latin, and the whole poem in translation, as well as some sections from Virgil's earlier works (Eclogues and Georgics). We will discuss Virgil's relationship to the historical, cultural and political contexts of his own time, and to earlier works of literature (such as Homer); we will also pay close attention to details of language, characterization, structure and point of view. \n\n", "semester": "2012C", "name": "TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE: CAESAR AND LUCAN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/29165/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rDifficulty": "3.25", "rStimulateInterest": "2.88", "rCourseQuality": "3.13", "rWorkRequired": "3.38", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.63", "rInstructorAccess": "3.13"}, "section": {"name": "TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE: CAESAR AND LUCAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-301", "path": "/courses/29165/sections/301", "id": "29165-301", "aliases": ["LATN-309-301"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 8, "path": "/courses/29165/sections/301/reviews/4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON", "first_name": "CYNTHIA", "last_name": "DAMON", "id": "4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON", "name": "CYNTHIA DAMON"}, "num_reviewers": 8, "id": "29165-301-4003-CYNTHIA-DAMON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LATN-309", "path": "/courses/29165", "sections": {"path": "/courses/29165/sections", "values": [{"name": "TOPICS: LATIN LITERATURE: CAESAR AND LUCAN", "sectionnum": "301", "primary_alias": "LATN-309-301", "path": "/courses/29165/sections/301", "id": "29165-301", "aliases": ["LATN-309-301"]}]}, "id": 29165, "aliases": ["LATN-309"]}
