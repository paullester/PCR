Accelerated introduction to reading of Latin authors, at twice the normal pace,equivalent in scope to second-year Latin (203-204). Ideal for undergraduates or graduate students from Penn or elsewhere who have completed the equivalent of one year Greek (e.g., GREK 112). Readings in simpler prose and poetry (e.g., Cornelius Nepos, Ovid), then in more challenging prose and poetry (e.g., Cicero, Pliny, Virgil, Horace), in combination with a thorough review of Latin grammar. By the end of the course students will have thorough familiarity with the grammar, vocabulary, and style of the selected authors, will be able to tackle previously unseen passages by them, and will be able to discuss language and interpretation. Note: Completion of Latin 212 with C- or higher fulfills Penn's Foreign Language Requirement. \n\n", "semester": "2009B", "name": "INTERMEDIATE LATIN", "reviews": {"path": "/courses/16731/reviews", "values": [{"ratings": {"rAmountLearned": "3.00", "rDifficulty": "2.00", "rStimulateInterest": "3.50", "rRecommendMajor": "3.00", "rCourseQuality": "3.00", "rWorkRequired": "3.00", "rInstructorAccess": "3.50", "rReadingsValue": "3.00", "rRecommendNonMajor": "3.50", "rCommAbility": "3.50", "rInstructorQuality": "3.50"}, "section": {"name": "INTERMEDIATE LATIN", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "LATN-212-920", "path": "/courses/16731/sections/920", "id": "16731-920", "aliases": ["LATN-212-920"]}, "comments": "", "num_students": 3, "path": "/courses/16731/sections/920/reviews/2160-ANDREW-A-FENTON", "instructor": {"path": "/instructors/2160-ANDREW-A-FENTON", "first_name": "ANDREW A", "last_name": "FENTON", "id": "2160-ANDREW-A-FENTON", "name": "ANDREW A FENTON"}, "num_reviewers": 2, "id": "16731-920-2160-ANDREW-A-FENTON"}]}, "credits": null, "primary_alias": "LATN-212", "path": "/courses/16731", "sections": {"path": "/courses/16731/sections", "values": [{"name": "INTERMEDIATE LATIN", "sectionnum": "920", "primary_alias": "LATN-212-920", "path": "/courses/16731/sections/920", "id": "16731-920", "aliases": ["LATN-212-920"]}]}, "id": 16731, "aliases": ["LATN-212"]}
