Fundamental chemical and physical principles underlying the properties of electronic, dielectric and magnetic materials will be developed in the context of metals, semiconductors, insulators, crystals, glasses, polymers and ceramics. Miniaturization and the nanotechnology revolution confronts materials science with limitations and opportunities; examples in which nanoscale materials are really different from our macro world experience will be explored.",

Therefore, in theory at least, materials selection can now proceed on a rational basis as an optimization process. In this course, we will focus on structural applications where mechanical design is central. By the end of the course, the students can expect to acquire a level of engineering familiarity with a broad range of materials, and be prepared to undertake material design projects in the future.",

Basic principles of chemistry, physics, thermodynamics and surface/interfacial science are applied to solid state, liquid, and colloidal approaches to making materials. The approaches to nano- and microfabrication: photolithography, soft lithography, nanoimprint lithography, 3D printing and self-assembly, are covered. The course is heavily lab based, with 25% of class time and 30% of the homework devoted to hands on experiences. Lab assignments are a series of structured individual/group projects. Evaluation is based on 3-4 lab reports, 4 problem sets with journal paper reading assignment, and a final project design.",

We will cover a variety of concepts and applications, drawing connections to both established and new approaches. We will discuss the limits of continuum mechanics and present newly developed theories and experiments tailored to describe micro- and nano-scale phenomena. We will emphasize specific applications throughout the course. Literature reviews, critical peer discussion, individual and team problem assignments, a laboratory project, and student presentations will be assigned as part of the course.",

Metals and alloys are emphasized because these are the materials in which corrosion is the most prevalent. Aqueous environments are also emphasized these are the common corrosion conditions. In the first half of the course, the impact and electrochemical nature of the corrosion are described, and then the corrosion fundamentals (electrochemical reactions, phase (pourbaix) diagrams, aqueous corrosion kinetics, passivity, and high-temperature oxidation) are emphasized. The forms of corrosion (galvanic, pitting and crevice, environmentally induced cracking) and corrosion in the human body (for example, surgical implants and prosthetic devices) and in other selective environments (concrete, seawater, and water solutions containing dissolved salts, sulfur, and bacteria) are also described in the second half.",

The course is heavily lab based, with 25% of class time and 30% of the homework devoted to hands on experiences. Lab assignments are a series of structured individual/group projects. Evaluation is based on 3-4 lab reports, 4 problem sets with journal paper reading assignment, and a final project design.",
