Through the course of the term, you will have a heightened sense of your individual strengths and opportunities for growth.

The hallmark of the course is experiential learning. Over the course of the year, Management 100 teams complete nearly 70 field projects.

Through the course of the term, you will have a heightened sense of your individual strengths and opportunities for growth. Eleven sections of approximately 60 students are scheduled each year (nine in the fall; two in the spring). Attached to each section are six recitations. Your recitation determines your project team. Whether you are in lecture participating in role plays or simulations, in recitation doing impromptu speeches, or out in the field working on your project, Management 100 is highly interative and participative. The hallmark of the course is experiential learning. Over the course of the year, Management 100 teams complete nearly 70 field projects. In the fall, freshmen participate in community service projects, a good number supplied by the United Way; in the spring, upper level transfer and dual degree students work on consulting projects vetted by Wharton's Small Business Development Center (SBDC).",
