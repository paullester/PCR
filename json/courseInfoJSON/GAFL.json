Whether you're writing for yourself or someone else, this course will provide the basics of speech writing and give you the opportunity to write, revise and deliver a variety of different speeches. You will also be given the opportunity to answer audience questions after your speeches. The emphasis will be on preparing and giving longer speeches where a prepared text or speaking notes would be advisable. In this performance course, you will examine and learn from great speeches--from the classics down to the present. Your speeches will be videotaped and you will receive feedback from both the instructor as well as your peers.",
