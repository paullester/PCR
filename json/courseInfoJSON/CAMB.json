    "course_description" : "In this course we will discuss the identification and characterization of genetic diversity in the human genome, the genetic basis of normal variable traits, and the genetic basis of human disease. The study of the human genome increasingly impacts almost every aspect of our society, from medicine to law enforcement to how we view ourselves. The focus of this course will be to apply concepts and methods of genetics and genomics analysis (gene mapping, genome sequencing, epigenetics, gene expression) to better understand the genetic basis of both normal variable traits as well as disease for Mendelian (those traits influenced by a single gene) and complex (those traits influenced by multiple genes and environment) traits. We will discuss how to distinguish the evolutionary and demographic forces (i.e. mutation, migration, selection, population size) that influence genotypic and phenotypic variation within and among human populations. We will discuss how genomics and population genetics methodologies are being applied to study modern human origins, analysis of ancient DNA, ancestry, and population history. We will also discuss the implications of these studies for personalized medicine. An ability to understand human genetic and genomics analyses will serve you well since in your lifetime you are almost certain to be faced with a major decision involving your heredity; and society will be forced to make major reforms in medicine, business, and law because of increasing genomics data. By the end of this class you should have a better understanding of the science behind the study of the human genome.",

CAMB/BIOL 480 does not attempt to cover all aspects of cell biology, and is therefore not appropriate for students seeking a lecture course that provides a comprehensive survey of the field. Rather, the primary objective of this course is to teach those students considering a career in the biomedical sciences how to read, discuss, and question research papers effectively. Intensive classroom discussions focus on the experimental methods used, results obtained, interpretation of these results in the context of cell structure and function, and implications for further studies. There is no assigned text; students learn to critically evaluate current literature by reading original papers on selected topics in modern cell biology. Accordingly, class participation/discussion is essential and the grade will be determined significantly by that. In addition, there will be two exams including answering short questions and an assay critiquing an original paper that is selected on a topic in Cell Biology.",

This is a required course for CAMB students in the Microbiology, Virology and Parasitology program and the Vaccine and Gene Therapy program, replacing IMMU 506 (Immune Mechanisms). It may also be used as an elective by CAMB students in other programs such as those from the Cancer Biology program and Cell Biology and Physiology program. The course is divided into two parts. The first deals with innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, the structure, function, and molecular biology of antigen receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules, and the development, activation, and differentiation of lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cells involved in immunity. The second part will cover the immune response in infection by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and in pathological states such as cancer, allergy, and autoimmunity. The course is comprised of two 1.5-hour lectures per week. EXAMS: There will be two exams. The first will be taken after part I, and the second after part II of the course. Both will be open book, in-class exams. The exam will consist of essay or brief answer questions based on experimental design and/or data. Each exam is weighed equally in determining the final letter grades of students. The grades are based solely on the exams.",

The organizers, along with faculty from the School of Medicine, the Wistar Institute and CHOP, with expertise in the corresponding areas provide lectures for the course. The students are expected to present, and participate in discussions of one or more key recent papers at Journal Clubs that are held at the end of each thematic group.

On alternate weeks a faculty member meets with students to discuss and review the contents of each selected article for the subsequent week's presentation. This is an elective course meant to excite and intellectually enlighten students regarding the latest advances in ion channel research. It includes a wide range of ion channel topics from basic biophysics, structure, and physiology to cell biology and clinical applications. It is attended by faculty, students, and postdocs from the departments of Physiology, Pathology, Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Biophysics, Psychiatry. We require a written critique of each paper presented by other participants during the semester, submitted prior to the formal presentation of the paper. This critique will be graded by a faculty member, as will the student's participation in both the preparatory sessions and formal presentation sessions. A final grade would be based on both of these components.",

    "course_description" : "This course, \"Cell control by signal transduction pathways\", will examine how various signal transduction mechanisms influence cell functions including replication, growth, transcription, translation and intracellular trafficking. The primary signal transduction pathways to be examined include those mediate by Notch, TGF-?, TNF-a, Ras, and Rho. We will also discuss intracellular signaling in response to DNA damage and explore in depth some of the key classes of enzymes involved in transmitting signals including kinases and phosphatases. In the first half of the course, invited faculty members will pick 2 relatively recent papers from their field that aren't necessarily definitive, but are interesting and could lead to new potential questions/areas for future investigation. Each paper will be assigned to a student, who will meet with the faculty mentor prior to the class to discuss the paper and their presentation. During the class, students will present each paper for approximately 45 minutes with time for discussion. Students will present the important background, break down the paper, look for strengths and weakness and come up with a plan of what the next set of experiments could or should be. In the second half of the course, students will independently pick a signal transduction paper for in-class presentation and will also write a short \"News and Views\" style article based on the paper they have chosen. The goal is that the course will lead students to think more about experimental design and interpretation rather than re-iteration of the biology they have learned as undergraduates.",

Three major themes will be covered: vectors, vector immunology and gene therapy of genetic and acquired diseases. The topics to be covered are viewed as an extension of topics covered in CAMB 610 (Molecular Basis of Gene Therapy), although CAMB 610 is not an absolute prerequisite for this seminar. Each class will consist of a brief introduction by an instructor, reviewing background information related to the theme discussion. The topics are explored through discussions, led by assigned students, of seminal research articles. Students are expected to have thoroughly reviewed the assigned articles and be able to present and discuss various aspects of the papers. Regular attendance and active participationin the discussions, which focus on critical evaluation of experimental design, data presentation and interpretation, is essential. Student evaluation will be based on attendance, in-class presentation (for 50% of the letter grade), and a take-home exam (for another 50% of the grade).",

The course format will include student-led discussion sessions both providing an overview of a topic as well as focusing on important papers from the primary literature. Students will be evaluated on their presentations and participation, as well as problem sets. Offered alternatelyin the spring sememster with CAMB 691.",
