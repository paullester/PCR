We will trace the ?American film industry from Edison to the internet, asking questions such as: What is the relationship between Hollywood and independent film? How has the global spread of Hollywood since the 1920s changed the film industry? How has Hollywood responded to crises in American politics (e.g., world wars, the cold war, terrorism)? And how have new technologies such synchronized sound and color cinematography, television and the VCR, and new digital technologies changed film and the film industry? We will look closely at representative studios (Paramount, Disney, and others), representative filmmakers (Mary Pickford, Frank Capra, and George Lucas, among others), and we will examine the impact of industrial changes on the screen.",

The first third of the semester presents a conceptual basis for assessing research quality based on the four \"types of validity.\" We also cover the standard elements of research design including sampling, measurement, and causal inference. These concepts are then illustrated through reviews of four research areas: surveys and field studies, qualitative/ethnographic studies, content analysis, and policy/evaluation studies. The last third of the semester focuses more on descriptive and inferential statistics, measures of association for categorical and continuous variables, and the language of data analysis. For these classes, we make use of SMALL STATA, a PC program useful for learning statistics. Most modules are illustrated through class exercises based on published articles.

This course will introduce and discuss recent contributions to the debate of how digital data - and the larger, more granular sets of observations of what we do as we use online technologies - change social research and the questions we can ask about the social world we inhabit. Although the use of big data raises many relevant privacy concerns, this course will show that there is value in stirring the discussion away from normative claims and consider, instead, how big data is helping us push social research to new, exciting frontiers.",

Signaling a concern with how, what, why and for whom collectives remember this phenomenon is closely tied to issues of identities, media technologies, politics and conflict, as well as imaginaries of the future. Memory by its very nature is mediated, and collective memory is even moreso, given the centrality of communications technologies in structuring imagined communities. Examining the technologies, strategies and politics of collective memory here is to go beyond the subject and foster an understanding of the intricacies and intersections of culture, communication and critical theory.",

In this course we will examine how Russians themselves communicate about and represent Russia and what this reveals about this complex society and its development. We will consider print journalism, novels, films, televised media, and the internet-paying close attention both to particular representations and to social institutions for their production, dissemination and consumption. Topics of special concern will include: conspiracy theories, representations of Russian history, culture or society is required. All readings and screenings will be in English.",

They shape how we consume news, how we interact with friends, peers and strangers, and how we mobilize groups or try to gain the attention of large audiences. Online networks encourage dynamics of information exchange that can, potentially, be very consequential for the societies we live in or the societies we would like to build. Networked technologies have, in brief, the potential to transform governance, collaboration, and organization, and radically change how we think about regulation and policy making in the digital age. This research seminar aims to help students develop a technical understanding of how networks operate, what dynamics they are more likely to encourage, and what features limit their ability to diffuse information or spread behavior. We need to understand the logic of networks - and learn how to model their complex and counter-intuitive dynamics -before we can analyze their social impact or engineer interventions, for instance, campaigns to promote socially beneficial behavior.",

It primarily covers the post-Watergate/post-Vietnam era of journalism, the past quarter century. We will focus each week on specific topics and areas of post-Watergate journalism as enumerated below. In weeks we do not have guest lecturers, the first half of class will concern the assigned readings and the second half of class will talk about current press coverage of national events over the prior week. In addition to assigned readings, students are required to stay informed about major national news stories and to follow coverage of them in the national media outlets. An important objective of this course is to afford students the opportunity to interact and discuss the intersection of the press, politics and public policy with some of the leading practitioners in the field, people who work in the \"media environment\" created by the national press.",

Surveys are perhaps the most ubiquitous tool of measurement in the social sciences today. Successful practitioners develop expertise in the art and science of survey methodology, including sampling theory and practice, questionnaire instrument development and operationalization, and the analysis and reporting of survey data. Survey researchers are scientists of the method itself testing various practices by which surveys can be improved upon, as well as developing a keen understanding of the nature of error in surveys and how to control it.

    "course_description" : "This course explores the significance of rituals as communicative events in American culture. We will examine both the \"how\" and the \"what\" of ritual communication and, with the aid of several ritual theorists, we will come to better understand the unique language of ritual. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which rituals contribute to the making and re-making of social groups, be they religious, political, familial or institutional. And we will necessarily attend to the obverse: the ways in which rituals create and perpetuate boundaries between \"us\" and \"them\" and between \"appropriate\" and \"deviant\" social behavior. Starting with birth and ending with death, this course will focus largely on what are called \"lifecycle\" rituals or \"rites de passage\". We will look at rituals that focus on individual transitions -- the quinceanera for example -- as well as those that mark transitions on a far larger scale such as presidential elections. We will explore rituals that unfold at the local level and are experienced \"up close\" as well as those that most Americans experience only via the media.",
