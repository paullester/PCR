The course will focus on the forces and patterns (natural and cultural) behind the shaping of recognizably \"American\" landscapes, whether urban, suburban, or rural. Methods for documenting and preserving landscape will be surveyed. Class discussions, readings, and projects will draw on several disciplines--cultural geography, vernacular architecture, environmental history, historic preservation, ecology, art, and more.",

We will begin by examining the theoretical literature on what constitutes a therapeutic landscape, whether the concept can be applied beyond a specific era, and what it does and doesn't explain. Attending to differences as well as connections, we'll study the rise of penitentiaries, asylums, hospitals and cemeteries as physical environments, keeping in mind the productive tension between their idealistic origins and sometimes-dystopic realizations. \"Landscape\" in its broadest sense will be our focus: not simply buildings, siting, circulation, and planting and but the cultural significance of these elements. Moving into the post- Civil War era, we'll investigate the way therapeutic impulses migrated into other types, e.g. college campuses, even as they lost some of their antebellum coherence. The last third of the course will bring us through the 20th c. It will examine postwar institutional landscape design, notably that ocorporate office parks, and, in the last week, discuss what has become of the therapeutic landscapes with which we began.",

    "course_description" : "Spring 2014: This seminar explores the intersecting social and cultural histories of photography and the urban and suburban built environment. No prior background in photography is necessary. Since its inception in 1839, photography has provided a critical means for documenting change in American cities and suburbs. We might characterize the medium's evolution as moving through four major phases: 1) celebration of the great structures of the industrial city; 2) documentation and attempted reform of the social life of Progressive and New Deal era cities; 3) critique of expanding postwar suburbs and sprawl; and 4) reflection on change in the post-industrial city. Each week, we will compare two image collections as the basis for our discussion. While authorship by individual photographers provides the entry point to many of these conversations, our primary focus will be the images' portrayal of urban and suburban people, structures, and space. Through our investigations, we will explore how photography's dual documentary and aesthetic properties have helped to reflect and transform the city, both physically and culturally.",

    "course_description" : "Spring 2015 - HSPV-703-301 - Topical Seminar: Germantown - Staff. This seminar/studio hybrid explores urgent preservation and planning issues facing Philadelphia's Germantown neighborhood. Germantown has the largest concentration of historic buildings and landscapes outside of the city's core. But the word \"concentration\" is itself misleading: beyond the densely built-up spine of Germantown Avenue, the area is defined by large lots and old trees -- the very qualities that lured villa-builders there 200 years ago and suburban developers ever since. Contemporary development pressuresare increasing dramatically; dealing with them robustly will require clear analyses of historic-resource patterns, zoning and planning structures, and community capacities. This course lays the groundwork for that effort, merging advocacy with analysis, resulting in recommendations for planning and preservation measures to improve the quality of life in Germantown without sacrificing its historic values and character. Students from varied PennDesign departments are welcome. Faculty for this course will include several preservation and planningprofessionals with significant experience in Germantown, advised by Prof. Wunsch. Spring 2015 - HSPV-703-302 - Topical Seminar: Memorials and Memorialization - Instructors - Ken Lum and Randall F. Mason. The functions, meanings, images, designs and politics of memorials are an urgent issue in contemporary society. Memorials and memorialization processes occupy a central place in culture and and public space, and concentrate some of the most interesting and fraught design, artistic and interpretive questions facing designers, artists and scholars today. This seminar, limited to 12 students from a variety of departments, will explore discourse and practices of memorialization. The focus of our critical inquiry will be the powerful connections between art, design, memory and culture as embodied and represented in memorials and memorialization processes. Particular topics will include controversies regarding tragedy memorials, changing discourses around public art, and the status of ephemeral/popular memorials. The course will be led by Randy Mason in collaboration with Ken Lum, Professor of Fine Arts. Together, they and the class will explore the literature from both heritage/social-science/history perspectives and art/design perspectives. Class sessions may include field trips, exercises, projects and guest lectures.",

    "course_description" : "Architectural surface finishes are among the most transformative and ephemeral materials in the built environment. They offer insight into architectural alterations, imbue buildings with meaning, influence the expression of design, and transform colorand light. They imitate, fool the eye, and function as disinfectants, insecticides and waterproofing. Given their nature, historic finishes are most often found buried beneath layers of paint and require microscopical analysis to determine their composition and color. The first half of the course will address the technology, analysis, deterioration, and treatment of historic finishes. In addition to lectures andlaboratory exercises, students will have the opportunity to apply new skills toa case study. Metals in a wide range of forms, finishes and colors have been used for architecture and its embellishment, and for monumental sculpture. In architectural context metal is considered a modern material, however, metals have been found associated with buildings since the third millennium BCE. By the first millennium CE, metals were used in the Mediterranean and also in India, China and Japan for buildings and monuments. 18th century English development of iron frame architecture allowed the development of the modern curtain wall. The course continues the introduction to material science and characterization of these metals - copper, iron, aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, titanium. It will survey traditional technologies for extraction, processing, forming, joining and finishing. A review of basic metallurgy, the mechanisms of corrosion and other aspects of deterioration, is followed by training in condition assessment, a survey of preventative strategies and the range of conservation treatment methods. The course will meet at the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and includes a tour of outdoor sites.

Of the major construction materials and systems employed since the earliest architectural building, few display the geographical and temporal spread or extreme material transformation as architectural ceramics. Born of clay, water, and fire, brick and its kin-terra cotta and structural, roof, and ornamental tile - have been employed to construct, protect, and ornament buildings in an unbroken tradition stretching from the towers of the Old Testament to the contemporary rain screens of today's high-rise buildings. Given this unique context, our focus will be a cross-disciplinary study of structural clay products - namely brick and terra cotta. We will consider these materials in terms of material process, product, and structural assemblage and these considerations will allow an exploration of (1)historical and traditional technology and design, (2)material characterization and analysis, (3)performance and (4)conservation. These areas of consideration will set the structure of the course which will be conducted as a seminar where students will have the opportunity to conduct original research and to contribute to the Exhibit: Feats of Clay to open in the Kroiz Gallery in May 2015. Guest lectures and visits to sites in New York City and Boston Valley Terra Cotta Co. in Buffalo are planned. Open to all students in historic preservation, architecture, fine arts, archaeology and art history.",

    "course_description" : "Time, like space, is all around us. Its evidence is visible in the natural world as physical change. In our own fabricated material works, time exerts its presence through the tell-tale signs of stylistic and technological anachronism and material degradation. It is through these indicators that we confront time indirectly and attempt to position a thing or place in relation to the present. How buildings and landscapes are received by each generation depends on the specific conditions of time and place. Built works, be they barns or bridges, gardens or corn fields, palaces or pit houses, all reflect something of their maker and user as well as the prevailing social and cultural norms. Such trajectories are dependent on many diverse factors; however once consciously examined, all creative works under consideration for their ability to communicate to us; to have relevance in ways consistent or new to their original authorship and to contemporary society. In our efforts to relate to buildings and places from the past, we use time as the primary measure from the present and historical narrative to describe what we know. As a form of material culture, buildings and landscapes are made and modified both consciously and unconsciously, directly and indirectly, thus reflecting individual and societal forces at play. Since the physical fabric and its evidences of alteration present one primary mode of inquiry, archaeological theory and methodology provide an excellent means to recover, read, and interpret that evidence in association with documentary and archival sources. This course will examine the theories and techniques necessary to investigate the morphological evolution of a structure and its physical setting. Students will learn and apply methods relevant to the reading of physical fabric as demonstrated and applied to a case site. The coursework assumes a knowledge of the core curriculum in historic preservation and is therefore recommended for advanced (i.e. second year) students.",
