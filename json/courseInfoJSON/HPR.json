The course continues with the introduction of more general tools for decision analysis, including decision trees and other mathematical models. A major focus of the course is the application of economic principles to the evaluation of health outcomes. During seminars, students will carry out practictical exercises that include problem solving, critically analyzing published articles, and learning to use computer software that facilitates decision and economic analyses.",

Relying on an asset model approach to learning about communities,the course will (1) incorporate a series of didactic sessions that describe the diversity of the Philadelphia region with respect to cultural, environmental, economic, faith-based, ethical, and political influences on community health in order to (2) prepare the students to conduct a case study focusing on a population and/or issue addressing a diversity of health and social service needs. These course components are intended to assist students in developing the lens through which they will consider research questions leading to successful community oriented research.",

The course teaches students practical tools for developing communications that effectively leverage policy impact. Sessions will examine: the dialectical relationship between research and policy; how selection of research methods may influence usefulness of results for the policy sphere; the implementation of research findings in real-world settings; the translation of research for a policy audience; and the role of various (the media; foundations; local, state, and federal government; advocates) in both research and policy debates. The instructors will draw on their work in pediatric health services research. The class will feature guest research and and policy experts from the public and private sectors, who will explore core concepts using case studies from their expertise in topics like health care reform, immigrant health, mental health, and early childhood home visitation. These didactic topical presentations will be followed by discussions, seminar discussion examining how research findings impacted policy, and writing exercises aimed at honing skills for a policy audience.",

The structure of the course will focus on 3 successive stages-(1) introduction to the foundation/theory of implementation science, (2) exposure to researchers conducting implementation research, and (3) and learning how to critically evaluate and design implementation science studies. An emphasis on specific tools in qualitative and mixed methods approaches is included.",
